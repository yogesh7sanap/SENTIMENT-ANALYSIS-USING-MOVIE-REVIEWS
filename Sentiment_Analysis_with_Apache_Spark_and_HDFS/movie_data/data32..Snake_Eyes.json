        "review_detailed_main": "So this is now essentially the third attempt to bring GI Joe to the big screen. Lorenzo Di Bonaventura returns at the helm and proves once again - he does not really care... Honestly - how this film actually came to be is beyond me - a group of professional people working in the industry collectively decided that firstly : this film should be made - then that Evan Spiliotopoulos (who has hardly written a single great film to date) should write the damn thing - then add a director, Schwentke (who has a track record of terrible blockbuster films) - and let's top it off with TV travel host/Rom-com break out - Henry Golding to play Snake eyes himself. Shocking....\n\nSO - It definitely is not the Snake eyes that people know and love. He does bad things in this film and unfortunately, Henry isn't a skilled enough actor to make you like him. I disagree that it was purely in the writing - a great actor can make you care for the most despicable characters but Golding proves here he should stick to Rom-coms...and his own accent. His physical skills and acting feel forced and awkward and in my opinion needs a lot of work if I would ever buy him as a legitimate action star. He does have some charisma and good looks though.\n\nIt seems like the majority of the articles and social media agree that the film's saving grace is Andrew Koji's Storm Shadow. He adds nuance and depth to Tommy (even though he is dealt the rough hand with having to deliver the majority of the exposition) He commands the screen whenever he is on and delivers us the most layered Storm Shadow in almost any medium to date - just too bad he is let down by an awful script. Koji steals the show with his performance and to top it off you can tell he knows how to move - his action moments were by far the most fun to watch - although he was let down by a terrible filming style there too. I definitely want to see more of Koji. Jin Sakai for Ghost of Tsushima!\n\nThe rest of the cast are great in their limited roles - Samara, Ursula, Iko and Peter Mensah - all do great. They are well cast but under utilised. Hollywood SERIOUSLY needs to stop thinking they know best with martial arts action sequences - Iko and Kenji Tanigaki's team is absolutely wasted here.\n\nThere was a lot of potential with a GI Joe reboot. There was some potential for a good Snake eyes film - but these people clearly are not the right people to do it. Paramount needs to learn. You would have thought Lorenzo etc would have learnt something since the last films 10 years ago - but clearly not. They have not only destroyed many people's favourite character - they have simple made a bad film and wasted a lot of money and talent....\n\n5.5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a big fan of Yakuza films, so when I saw the trailer for \"Snake Eyes,\" I was ecstatic - a gritty, grounded origin of one of G. I. Joe's most beloved characters, in the form of a Japanese mobster movie, seemed too good to be true. And lo and behold, it was! \"Snake Eyes\" seems to suffer from an identity crisis; there is not enough gangster politics to be a successful gangster movie - there is not enough character development to be a satisfying drama - and perhaps the worst offense: there is not enough well-filmed action for this to be a great action film.\n\nLet's jump right into why \"Snake Eyes\" isn't a good film - the action. When you hire master choreographers to create beautiful action sequences, why would you then destroy them by choosing to film your action with close-up, handheld, shaky cam? This stylistic decision is infuriating and unforgivable. There was only one sequence in this movie that was well shot; other than that, literally every other single action scene was made incomprehensible due to the filmmaking.\n\nThere were so many set pieces that could've been memorable and exciting if only the cameraman would've put the camera on a tripod, prepared a wide shot, and stepped away. You have scenes of small armies engaged in katana-on-katana action, and you won't be able to see any of it because the cameraman is standing two feet away and shaking the camera like it owes him money. This filmmaking decision literally ruined the action in this film, and as a consequence, ruined the film itself - because when the action in your action movie sucks, your movie sucks.\n\nThat said, perhaps the storyline and the engaging characters can add some sort of entertainment value? You'd be half right. The story itself is pretty interesting, if not very engaging. There's enough to keep you slightly invested in what's happening and why, but again, everything is framed around terribly filmed action sequences that damper the fun. The acting was serviceable, but nothing too breathtaking. Henry Golding as Snake Eyes had a certain tenacity about him that was fun to watch, but the script seemed to try a little too hard to make him \"cool.\" Samara Weaving was gorgeous, as always, and pretty good here - however, she barely has any screen time, and isn't introduced until about half way through the film. That said, she is a show stealer when she's on screen.\n\n\"Snake Eyes\" did have some cool cinematography to bask at - if you enjoy Asian cinema, you'll certainly enjoy the look of the film. That said, if you enjoy good action, you're going to despise this movie. I'd recommend only checking this out if you're a big G. I. Joe fan - if you're not? There's a million other Yakuza action films at your disposal; don't waste your time with this."

Just a generic, \"gritty\", MCU-styled action film that doesn't respect the source material and features characters who only look good and are charisma vacuums.\n\nThe Stephen Sommers films (which were terrible) did a better job depicting Snake Eyes as the lethal, stealthy, and charismatic mute he truly is."

The two hours felt dragged out with the most cliched action/martial-arts forgettable story, that was riddled with plot and technical issues. I can't remember the last time I saw such a predictable film.\n\nDon't get me started on the cheesy dialogue and lame attempts at humor. Director Robert Schwentke also failed to give much cohesion to the all-over-the-place script with his annoying shaky-cam and sword-cut editing, as well as his (mostly) migraine-inducing action scenes. He tried too hard - and failed to make this a blockbuster, instead of the B grade action film it was.\n\nHenry Golding as Snake-Eyes lacked the action-hero presence and was about as convincing as Clint Eastwood as a stand-up comedian. The rest of the casting and performances were decent, but the only redeeming quality of this film was the amazing production sets and costumes. It's a generous 6/10 from me."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, this has *nothing* to do with G. I. Joe, as it is a medieval story about two Japanese clans and the protagonist is caught somewhat in between. Yes, it happens today, but 90% of all fights are using swords and the prize of the war is a magical stone. It's like someone took an existing Japanese samurai and ninjas script, added an extraneous character and made him the protagonist, then plastered on a Joe/Cobra connection and brought it into the present. And the way they added this stuff is like fixing a broken mirror with industrial sticky tape on the visible side.\n\nAnd what a cast this had: Andrew Koji from Warrior (I still crave for a new season), Iko Uwais from Raid, Peter Mensah from Spartacus, Takehiro Hira (who in my mind did the best job in the film, even if he was the villain and had a really dumb role), Samara Weaving from Guns Akimbo. Not to mention Eri Ishida, who did more in a few scenes than \"Snake Eyes\" in the entire film. They did nothing with all of this. The fights were fractured and made little sense, focused on form and ignoring substance. Two people fighting 50 and succeeding because they all used swords and the heroes had unlimited stamina, the usual running (slowly and awkwardly) from bullets scene, people running in the sword range to fire a gun, ugh! It was incredibly ugly. Even the motorcycle and car scenes were ridiculously bad. A team of 5 snipers could have finished *everybody* without loses.\n\nWorst of all, it's called G. I. Joe Origins and it features a character who has never heard of the Joes in a time when both Cobra and Joes have been established for a long time. There is no origin story at all! There is no story, really!\n\nBottom line: this film is something that whole teams of people should be fired because of. A 100 million dollar film that manages to waste every resource it bought. Avoid it like it's the plague."

        "review_detailed_main": "Saw the movie last night and was not impressed with anything I saw. The makers of this film have either no idea of the origins of Snake-Eyes or they intentionally destroyed the character. Aside from the fact that Snake-Eyes was always a Gaijin (white guy) he was also honorable in all that he did. This version has him as a two-faced, lying, thief. The feeble redemption arc in the final act was too little - too late, and unbelievable. The casting choices also left me a bit confused. Golding was never a good choice for Snake-Eyes and as much as I love Samara Weaving, she was a horrible Scarlet. The actress who ineptly portrayed the Baroness was too young for the character and was not even close to being believable. Iko Uwais was great as usual but would have been a much better Storm Shadow or even Snake-Eyes! Andrew Koji did do a good job as Storm Shadow and his was the best performance in the whole film by far.\n\nThe story was subpar, even for a genre piece, and the script could have been written by a middle-schooler. The action was decently choreographed and wasn't too over the top. It seemed like it couldn't decide whether to be gritty or cartoonish in its approach to the action, which was a letdown. There are several continuity issues as well; a brawler raised on the street with no formal training can automatically hold his own against highly trained ninjas (can you say Rey Palpatine?) or a girl who had been a devoted part of the clan for over a decade breaking sacred rules to save someone she just met?\n\nAll in all, this movie sucked!"

Joe movie yet.\n\nHenry Golding plays Snake Eyes & he's excellent in the role & is a very good actor that acts with his eyes alot & i love that. This story starts from the very beginning with when \"Snake Eyes\" was just a young boy that witnessed his father's murder that sends him into the dangerous underworld of Japan as he works his way through the Criminal underworld driven by rage. Snake Eyes eventually joins an ancient Japanese clan called the Arashikage after saving the life of their heir, Storm Shadow (played Brilliantly by Andrew Koji) but things get messy & Snake Eyes becomes conflicted with who his loyalty lies with.\n\nI loved all the Ninja mythology & beautiful Japanese setting & the glowing Neon drenched streets & tons of adrenaline-fulled action set-pieces. The fight scenes are Awesome & the look of the film is stunning.\n\nSnake Eyes has an old school 90's action movie feel to it that i dug because i grew up during those times & was obsessed with action films. If this came out back then in the 90's it would've probably starred Brandon Lee or Van Damme as Snake Eyes.\n\nSnake Eyes is a great movie & a grest origin story of a beloved fan favourite.\n\nSimply AWESOME."

It is clear the script got a major rewrite at some point just before or during filming. We are never sure why Samara Weaving character, Scarlett, is in the film. Its clear that they had a plan at some point and she was supposed to be a \"love interest\" but it was either left on the cutting room floor or reworked.\n\nI enjoyed Andrew Koji in his role as Tommy Arashikaga and as true foil to Henry Golding as Snake Eyes."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love Henry Golding and was so excited to see him in an action movie. He was handsome as ever, however, I was a little disappointed with the movie as a whole. The plot was a little weak, the first half of the movie is way too slow, and the fight scenes were a bit stale. I did appreciate that they took the movie more seriously than the other two G. I. Joe movies that were as cheesy as the cartoons. It was an entertaining movie, but there were so many missed opportunities. My review is similar to Black Widow in terms of the supporting character surpassing the titular character (BW took a back seat to Yelena as Snake Eyes took a backseat to Storm Shadow in their own movies). I actually think the actors that played Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes needed to swap roles. Henry Golding lacked the grit to play a hardened criminal doing what he needs to survive on the streets. He is too much of a pretty boy and too charming which worked exceptionally well with his previous roles in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" \"A Simple Favor\" and \"Last Christmas\", but didn't quite work for Snake Eyes. The actor playing Storm Shadow had a more stoic and menacing presence and better fighting skills. I would have probably bought Henry Golding as a shrewed, debonair, next in line clan leader treated somewhat like a prince where others do most of the fighting for him. He did well in \"The Gentleman\" as a ruthless, yet suave, villain but I'm not buying the stealth and lethal ninja with a newly developed conscious. I do think the movie was better than the rating it was given, but it was not a really solid movie."

Because of this, I judge this movie only as an independent action, hoping it to be a great summer blockbuster. And I was disappointed.\n\nBefore the movie began, Henry Golding shared that there's gonna be a lot of action. That's true, as there were multiple sword fights. However, each fight was short and unsatisfying. The camera angles were bad, and I couldn't see the choreography clearly. Iko Uwais was in this movie, and he's a fantastic martial artist actor. However, he got little screen time. It's almost like they don't have the budget for long fight choreography.\n\nThe story was boring and not special. Snake Eyes was a bland and bad protagonist. I don't care much about his journey, and the ending for his character felt unjustified. It's not that Henry Golding's acting was bad, but the direction for his character made him like a side character.\n\nThe acting was okay across. Only Andrew Koji stood out as the Storm Shadow. He was pretty badass with the swords, especially his serious face. I think he stole the spotlight from Golding's Snake Eyes.\n\nOverall, a mediocre story with unsatisfying action scenes. 5/10."

Cause they didn't really even finish Snake Eye's backstory, this was more like a introduction when it could have had a nicely contained story with many sequel strings. The guy playing Snake Eyes and Akiko were wonderful to watch. Ever scene between them was great. The Trials were awesome. The car fight was entertaining. If they had just left some things out (Like the Joes) and kept the story self contained this would have been a great movie instead of a good one. Too much weighing it down!"

And it was, throughout. You can't see anything. Constant close-ups and shaky cam. How is this still a thing? The action and fight scenes in G. I. Joe: Retaliation in 2013 were significantly better. I know this because i rewatched it the day before. Sm damn h.\n\nOn top of that, many of the scenes were dark. Lots of poor editing choices and quick-cuts. And worst of all, allow a fight scene to happen for more than 5 seconds. This seems to plague most hollywood movies. A fight will last 5 seconds before something interrupts, or one of them tackles the other and fall down a shaft. Can we just see a fight? Maybe 60 seconds? Or at least 30? Is that too much to ask?\n\nYOU HAVE IKO UWAIS (from the raid redemption, a GOAT martial arts movie). How do you waste him? He can do anything! And you give him a two minute \"fight scene\" involving bowls of water??????? And another 30 seconds late in the movie??????? Unbelievable.\n\nI also want to complain about another stupid hollywood trend. THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE RATED R. It's about ninjas fighting with swords, sais and throwing stars. There should be blood and stabbings, but we see none. Grow some balls plz. Or at least release the unrated cut simultaneously so we can choose. Sm damn h again\n\nOther than that, the movie was mediocre overall. I was invested in the story most of the way, but then it delves into madness. I like the two lead actors, and i was invested in the characters, especially tommy. But it didn't amount to anything.\n\nThere were some really dumb moments and things that make no sense. Like using swords when you have guns. Or a guy with a magical stone that incinerates ppl but not using it to prevent his defeat. Also, in a movie entirely based in reality, a magical stone feels so out of place.\n\nAll in all, this wasn't a good movie, but i could have enjoyed it if the action was good (1 viewing, 7/28/2021)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The latest film in the G. I. Joe cinematic universe has arrived with \"Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins\". The film was originally planned to arrive in March of 2020 but faced delays due to cinematic closures during the Pandemic.\n\nThe film opens with a young boy being orphaned after a group of thugs kills his father. Years later the man is still obsessed with finding out who killed his father and earns a living in underground fighting known as Snake Eyes (Henry Golding)\n\nHis exploits get the attention of Kenta (Takehiro Hira); who hires him into his organization with a promise to help him find the man who killed his father.\n\nSnake Eyes soon finds himself working on the docks where he smuggles guns into fish bound for Japan. Despite his misgivings working for criminals, he befriends a man named Tommy (Andrew Koji); who teases him about his demeaning work by calling him \"Fish Boy\".\n\nWhen Kenta forces Snake Eyes to kill Tommy for being a spy; Snake Eyes refuses and the two make a daring escape to Japan. It is learned that Tommy is next in line to run his clan and that Kenta was banished years prior and plans revenge.\n\nDespite mistrust from a trusted associate named Akiko (Hakura Abe); Snake Eyes begins his training in the Ninja Arts which should he survive will make him a valued part of the Clan which Tommy believes is correct thanks to his Blood Debt to Snake Eyes.\n\nThe film focuses on various aspects of training before branching into the larger story of divided loyalties and honors which results in a few battles and chases along the way.\n\nWhile the film does space the action out; it does provide some great cinematography and the action is entertaining even if it lacks much tension.\n\nThe biggest issue is that the G. I. Joe/COBRA connection seems a bit forced as The Baroness (Ursula Corbero) arrives to move things along but it is mainly for the purpose of getting characters to do this and get that so the film can move towards the climactic action.\n\nSamara Weaving does show up as Scarlett but she does not have a very large part in the story and aside from a few limited action moments; she seems to be more of the token G. I. Joe representation.\n\nGolding and Hira are very good and their intertwined and complicated relationship is giving plenty of time to develop as their past is a large part of their futures and the film does a good job in explaining their past and future motivations.\n\nThe film blends Asian and Western film styles and in doing so creates an enjoyable film that for me was more enjoyable than the prior films in the series. To me those films focused mainly on action and this one was focused on developing characters.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen what direction future films in the franchise will take; it would be interesting to see more of Snake Eyes story down the line.\n\n3 stars out of 5."

Joe Origins\" weren't exactly sky high, given the previous live action movies based on the cartoons.\n\nBut still, of course I sat down to watch this movie and see what writers Evan Spiliotopoulos, Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse would come up with.\n\nAnd while \"Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins\" certainly was a watchable movie, this was essentially a no-brainer. You just disconnect your brain, lean back and munch the popcorn while watching the action on the screen. In terms of proper contents for a deeper storyline or a fulfilling storyline, then \"Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins\" is not the movie you should watch. Nay, this was just mindless action with a \"G. I. Joe\" template dragged down over it to sell it to a wider audience.\n\nI must admit that I sit here with a feeling of this being a rather unnecessary and unfulfilling movie, now that the movie came to an end. Sure, the movie was a cheesy action flick and watchable enough for what it turned out to be. But this was by no means an outstanding movie from director Robert Schwentke.\n\nThe action sequences in the movie are good, and they are what keeps the movie afloat. That, and also some nice visuals and special effects. But other than that, then this movie was a shallow shell.\n\nThe cast ensemble was interesting, though, I will say that much. I am not familiar with Henry Golding, but he did a good job at bringing Snake Eyes to life on the screen. And actor Andrew Koji was definitely a good choice for Stormshadow. Now, it was really great to see the likes of Iko Uwais and Haruka Abe in the movie as well.\n\nI doubt that I will ever return to watch \"Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins\" a second time, because the storyline just barely had enough contents to support the first viewing.\n\nMy rating of \"Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins\" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars."

        "review_title": "An Origin Story Whose Eyes Fell From the Prize",
        "review_detailed_main": "LIKES:\n\nDecent Pace: The first G. I. Joe dragged its feet to get to the good parts and the second just sacrificed everything else, Snake Eyes origin managed to meet middle ground for this reviewer. An event that drives the character sets the stage for an emotional foundation, that dives into modern era and gets us into the chronicles of shadows that he will soon start writing. The movie then keeps a pace going that is fast enough to not be bogged down by details, but also not shallow to deprive us of a story. I enjoyed this balanced pace and the attempts at telling a story that had action support it.\n\nThe Special Effects/Sound Editing: For a big blockbuster, you always hope that special effects and sound effects to bring the full experience to the theater trip. Snake Eyes is a prime example of Hollywood's effects lab in full stride with high special effects moments, intense sound effects of sword clanging, explosion blasting, gun blazing goodness that we love to see in these kinds of film. There is seldom a quiet moment in this film and I really enjoyed the attention to detail to help keep things looking real without diving too much in CGI cheesiness. In addition, I appreciated that slow motion was only used a little bit here and there instead of at every turn (take a lesson Zack Snyder) utilized for only those choice moments to emphasize a kill or awesome move.\n\nStory is better: I'm not saying it's gold or complete, but the story is miles better than what we got years ago with Channing Tatum. Characters don't feel too cartoony anymore, simplistic forms brought to real life and feeling out of place and forced for the sake of humor. Snake Eyes origins have a little more depth to his involvement, giving the character a darker set of morals to balance in his quest to be a hero. The ninja has deeper levels than simply slashing and gunning, and I liked seeing his skills develop with his character alongside several other members of the ninja league. Throw in the ties to the G. I. Joe universe and you again have a good potential restart like Bumblebee before it. The origins story certainly does have its limitations, but it still was lightyears better with its character and story development compared to the corny origin of Cobra commander in the previous installation.\n\nThe Action: The highlight for me is the action sequences in this film and how much it feels like something out of G. I Joe cartoons. Sword fights are the primary means for fighting in this installment, but it delivers on the promised cling clang, Kungfu, slash and slice that trailers showed. There is some bite to the fights, and lots of those ridiculous, off the wall moves that have been made famous from Bruce Lee movies that adds that campy edge to make it fun. I felt they managed to keep things relatively dynamic in terms of the arenas they fought and enjoyed getting distracted by the quick bouts in those pinnacle moments.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nSome Of The Acting Is Cheesy: There are times that the acting drives down a different pathway, one that is less fun and weaker given the direction they were going. Mostly during the emotional moments, these soap opera like cries are funnier than emotional and thus feel out of place. Some temper tantrums and set up scenes are also a bit more melodramatic, trying to set up an epic fight that then sort of fizzles out in the long run. A few other characters need some more time to help get the full acting effect, but this is rather minor for me compared to some of the other limitations.\n\nStory Limitations: While the story is an improvement, there are still things that need work in terms of making this a quality tale. Predictability is a big part, with so much foreshadowing and leading dialogue to help scream what is going to happen with our crew, especially if you are a GI Joe fan. Second is the fact that there is a lot of introductions in this origin movie and not necessarily all were needed to the extent we saw. Snake Eyes' journey into the ninja world feels a little rushed and simplified given the buildup, with several trials and training montages skipped for some reason. Meanwhile, the inner workings of the Yakuza are sort of blunted as well and the obsession of certain components sort of makes for a lame reason for why they are doing what they are doing. Throw in certain characters from the Joe universe making early, sometimes in your face, appearances and it again throws a wrench in the smooth workings of the machine this movie was starting to be. Sadly, the other thing I did not enjoy is the big plot device that sort of tied the arcs together. In terms of the cartoons, it could work when the war gets established and Cobra Commander starts to look for alternative options. However, this magical artifact that is in this film is sort of standing out given all the other avenues of technology and warfare they could have chosen. It makes the movie jump into the corny realm and away from the direction it was going. In addition, I believe there are those angry with the fact that Snake's new origins may be insulting to the good name of the character, and the purists who prefer him silent and stoic will most likely not enjoy the direction they took in this film.\n\nThe Action/Camera work: While I enjoy the action's pace, the sound effects, and the energy, I can't lie and say there was more coordination that was still needed. For one thing, more edge and suspense with the fights would have been nice, adding rivalry, stakes, and a few close calls that could have made them more exciting. The knowing that most if not all parties would survive thanks to that foreshadowing took a bit of that suspense away from me. Second, the fights could have evolved a little more past pure sword fighting, bleeding the gun play and sword fighting Snake will eventually find normal when working for the Joes. Third is more time with other characters showing their moments, as many of the extra characters had only fleeting glimpses of awesome moves when there could have been so much more merging of styles the way the Avengers did in their movies. Fourth, the unnecessary involvement of other Joe's characters sort of interrupts the flow of things, and though some cool moves could be seen, I would have liked them to not be randomly inserted into the fray with little logic or purpose. However, the biggest limitation is the camera work and the masking of the editing involved with the sequences. Why shaky camera syndrome and new angles switching is popular I don't know, but it got in the way of what could have been awesome displays of martial arts and sword play. Not the most nauseating, but still would work on full sequence shots and less editing to make it seem full sequences would be a major improvement.\n\nThe VERDICT: Snake Eyes was more enjoyable for me than I had expected and managed to bring some promising elements to the table should the G. I. Joe verse rev up. I liked Golding's class and poise, and I felt that there was plenty of time with many characters they introduced. Snake Eyes' journey to his ninja status has some heart and layers, helping give some better character development than the past. With a good pace and some action sequences that are very comic book like , with great sound effects/special effects flair, high energy, and keeping the movie going. Yet, the movie still has some work to do to get the universe set up to the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me it wants to achieve. The acting does fall into cheesy territory at times, with the story limitations forcing our group to have to go into soap opera drama levels that take ways from the better performances. This new origins tale does sort of squash Snake Eyes character that most know and has predictability patterns that mess up some things, but it's the fact they tried to cream so much into the movie again fails for this reviewer. As for the action game, the jittery camera and uneven editing take away from what could have been the next stage of action for this series, alongside unneeded interruptions from a fight that could have been the perfect bite to the Joe army. Overall though, it's fun and promising for G. I. Joe to return if they can help add some finesse to the foundation.\n\nMy scores are: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0 ."

It's too mature for kiddies but too ridiculous for adults so I have no idea who they're aiming the movie at!\n\nThe SFX are decent which stops it from getting 1 star but other than that avoid."

However, the car chasing, the fight scenes, the flying fighters reminding you of matrix i kinda say, very well done. The story it's your typical \"revenge will not bring anything good\" but still that won't stop anyone to move forward until they hit a brick wall and realize.... \"hey, maybe that wasn't a great idea\". To summarize in my opinion it's a 6 stars movie and i will definitely watch a second part if they make one. Give it a chance but take it as it comes, just a family adventure movie."

Joe so what ever changes they made to the story didn't bother us. We wanted an entertaining film with a fine story, good acting and great action scenes and that's what we got.\n\nCould it have been better? Yes absolutely. Samara Weaving's acting as Snake Eyes was weak compared to the west and the director went with 'shaky camera' at times. Fight scenes were cut off pretty often and that's a shame when you have the legendary Kenji Tanigaki as the fight choreographer (Kenshin movies)."

Joe films were stupid but lots of fun, this one is too high on stupid and too low on fun. Samara Weaving is in it for a hot minute, and focusing on her might have brought so much levity this film desperately needed, but alas the film is centered around Henry Golding who fails to bring much to the table.

Yes he is quite charming but NO he is not charismatic. His acting feels fake...his accent is all over the place....he is not the Snake eyes people wanted.\n\nKoji on the other hand was phenomenal...his acting was powerful, magnetic and has a depth to him. His physical skills clearly outshine Golding's too. Perhaps Koji looks too asian looking for Hollywood to be a lead...so we get Golding leading instead and Koji having to play second fiddle...although even then Koji manages to outshine him in my opinion. This is the Storm Shadow a lot of people wanted. Should have been called 'Storm Shadow'\n\nThe film however....god...when will hollywood get it right. Shaky cam, poor writing and so many other terrible decisions. Lets hope it bombs so the producers learn a thing or two - but let's face it...they probably wont."

The action was plentiful however, that fact that it was all an over-choreographed, quick-cut, shaky mess will leave you with more headaches than thrills. The rest of the cast do fine and the villain is okay but most were underutilized and in the case of Samara Weaving, she was completely miscast. If they had actually hit any marks along the way I would have been forgiving in some way but it was too long, too lame and too formulaic to like.

It may be a minor complaint but for me the credibility goes out the window with such obvious details that are just not thematic."

Witnessing his father being murdered. He plots a revenge scheme to find the killer. Even if he has to join a menacing clan. Until he escapes with Storm Shadow (Andrew Koji). Which he invites Snake Eyes to his family clan. Where he will master fighting skills and become part of the family. While Snake Eyes is keeping and searching for his fathers killer.\n\nThe plot is boring. A revenge story that feels flat. It does have some set up for G. I. Joes. Like a short introduction of Scarlett (Samara Weaving) and Baroness (Ursula Corbero). And hint of a shadowy organization like Cobras. The script does not help but give dull characters and a flat story.\n\nHenry Goulding is great with the role. Andrew Koji is forgettable. Along with Ursula Corbero. Samara Weaving is decent with the character.\n\nThe action sequences is decent with its fair share of action. Director could have shot it better. It was exciting to see once. But forgettable after it is all over. There is a mid credit scene that plots away for another sequel.\n\nSnake Eyes is an okay film which could have been better.

This felt very 2005.\n\nOne of the perks for me to see this movie was the breathtaking sight of Henry Golding, but he had to know, if this was successful, none of us would see OR hear him again. Honestly, since that's the case with the character - he's mute + never takes off his helmet, they might as well save money and recast him.\n\nBut, I digress. This movie was pretty good, beautifully shot and probably the best of the G. I. Joeverse. Also: it was horribly edited with action scenes at times incomprehensible and predictable as all hell. And I'm not just saying that because it's a prequel of sorts.\n\nBruce Wayne, sorry, I mean \"Snake Eyes\" sees his dad murdered right in front of him and spends his off-screen time growing into adulthood by seeking revenge and becoming a clawless Wolverine. Lucky for him, two different Japanese clans want to use him.\n\nCue music: Some of them want to use him. Some of them want to get used by him. Some of them want to abuse him. Some of them want to be abused.\n\nStill fits. Anyways, my other draws for seeing this opening weekend: I played with, watched and read G. I. Joe as a child and Snake Eyes was always my favorite and the best-looking Asian actor/martial artist, Iko Uwais, had a part. Mercifully, Iko's in it a lot more than I expected. I thought he'd play a bit part, but he was a good scene stealer.\n\nI liked the rest of the cast and characters, especially Tommy (the bro,) Takehiro (the Anti---hero,) Blind Master (the clich\u00e9,) Baroness (the always great bi+ch) and Scarlett (my favorite Babysitter.) They all did what they could with their roles as the story could've been better and took a long time to get where we knew it would evolve to.\n\nSo, despite feeling like the recent Black Widow - both 2021 \"Origin\" stories, but feel dated already - it's a fun action/adventure with tons of action and gorgeous Asian men.\n\n***\n\nFinal Thoughts: I'd have to rewatch the first 2 - haven't in probably 7 or so years, but I'd have to say Snake Eyes was the best one. I recall not liking the 2nd one much and the first, I was a huge defender of. It was everything I'd hope the Transformers Movie would've been and more. (I grew up with both toys and liked Transformers way more than G. I. Joe, but with the movies, this series far outdid the terrible Michael Bay films.)"

In a nutshell he's an AMAZING martial arts talent and isn't afforded a real moment to shine in this film given the caliber of action awesomeness he's known for.\n\nThe only criticism that I've read repeatedly that does have a bit of merit (imo) was the over editing on some of the fight sequences particularly in the beginning, but I didn't find this to be the case for the majority of the film.\n\nOverall I think this film accomplishes what it set out to do: tell the origin of Snake Eyes AND set the table for future GIJOE films.\n\nI enjoyed it and found this take on Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow's back story to be compelling and entertaining! Can't wait to see more!!"

But then the scene jumps to somewhere else and then comes back to the end where they are all lying dead around Iko. This is like casting Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and making him a mute (oh, wait...). That's one simple example of how bad the movie is.\n\nThe entire movie looks like a tutorial on things that shouldn't be done in an action movie. The action doesn't register because the shots are shaky or/and too close. These tricks are employed when the actors are incapable of fast movements or doing action sequences. But in Snake Eyes the entire cast in the movie are martial dance experts (and Iko practically redefined action movies in his lean and mean Raid movies) and yet it feels like watching action in that last Star Wars movie.\n\nAnyway, if you have nothing else to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, you can pick this movie. But you will be entertained only if you expect not much from the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I previewed The Rise of Cobra for my neighbour's young teenage son in anticipation of seeing SNAKE EYES. The original G. I. Joe film got a lot of negative reviews, but I loved it. As one of those young males who scooped up both the 3-3/4\" toy line and the Marvel comic books, the film version was definitely coloured by nostalgia. I was pleased that the boy next door liked that film as much as I did. The action was constant, the plot mostly made sense, and there were all kinds of colourful characters with rich back story that was laid out in fast-paced scenes. I willingly overlooked the physical impossibility of it all (sinking icebergs, anyone?) with the same spirit GI:Joe fans wrote to Marvel Comics to exchange plothole explanations for No-Prizes.\n\nSnake Eyes couldn't be a more different experience. There were long, plodding scenes - and if they had been exposition, it might not have been bad. But it wasn't even that - they were long soliloquys with platitudes about honor and loyalty and honesty. The crux of the film is Snake Eyes facing three challenges to join a Japanese 'clan'. But none of it makes any sense. You have a sword fight on a Los Angeles pier (why wouldn't they just bring guns - I mean, the whole job at the pier was as a gun smuggler), and a magic jewel and some death defying motorcycle stunts. You have low-rent copies of the Baroness and Scarlet from the G. I. Joe films. The actors they selected have no gravitas at all (Yeah, it would be hard to match Siena Miller's performance in the original.) And you have a little wokeness thrown in; the African member of the family, the super grandma in charge (patriarchy=evil, matriarchy=good).\n\nWanted badly to like this one, but it was mostly just an incoherent mess, certainly in contrast to the character's original development in the comic books, which was echoed in Rise of Cobra in a couple of succinct flashbacks. Those flashbacks were far more entertaining than this, unfortunately.\n\nPositives are the lead actor's acting and some nice visuals, particularly of Japan."

He befriends a man in charge of the future of his clan. The orphan is asked by a government agency to infiltrate his friends clan and steal a jewel. The orphan is torn between his friend and the government agency. This movie is directed by Robert Schwentke (Red) and stars Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Aliens), Andrew Koji (Fast and Furious 6), Peter Mensah (Spartacus), \u00darsula Corber\u00f3 (Money Heist) and Samara Weaving (Ready or Not). The storyline for this is very straightforward but fun for fans of the original animated series to watch unfold as traditional characters slowly get introduced into the storyline. I loved the action scenes throughout the movies. The street fights, sword fights, and action scenes on the motorcycles are all over the top and well done. Overall this is an action genre junky fans dream that I would score a solid 7/10."

I. Joe, but I prefer to not even remember the movies are related.\n\nThe villains are just as clich\u00e9d as you might think and the appearance of a beloved \"La Casa de Papel\" actress in Tokyo made me chuckle as every fan of the series will surely get that reference. Now the girl could barely walk with those shoes and that bothered me to no end.\n\nOverall I didn't enjoy this movie at all, the pacing is awful, the fights are terrible and the script...I'm not even talking about it."

It is fun, quick, action packed, and has enough character moments to satisfy its story. It also serves as a good starting point for possible G. I. Joe movies, if they ever come to be. Which I have doubt about. That's because the fun comes at a price, that price comes at a cost of logic and questionable direction. It's a shame that it's many fighting set pieces come at an over kinetic shakey cam and multiple quick edits. The camera whips and zooms in with every hit and you become dizzy and numb to it. Even more disappointing is the characters become increasingly super human as mystical elements start to rear their heads. These elements don't actually affect the characters, they stay human, but the plot starts acting like more is going on without telling us. This removes the weight behind each action and choice. And Most of those are bizarre and irrational. No one seems to be an actual good guy, well except Scarlett who shows up in an unnecessarily forced bathroom Brawl, placed just so we know that she's a badass. Still though I liked Henry Golding in the role even though he feels less like Snake Eyes then some fans will like. But if this is what the series could look like going forward, I see potential in its growth."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Snake Eyes; here's the breakdown of my ratings:\n\nStory: 1.00 Direction: 1.50 Pace: 1.50 Acting: 1.25 Enjoyment: 1.25\n\nTOTAL: 6.50 out of 10.00\n\nSnake Eyes is your typical Action Adventure film based on boys' dollies. I can't wait for the new Barbie origins movie to come out - Scarlet Johannson doing her best black widow but with blonde hair. Just joking, though, if any movie executives are out there and decide to nick my idea, I Copywrite the notion here and now :-)\n\nThe story isn't too terrible though it does possess one major flaw. After a young boy witnesses the murder of his father, he quests for revenge against the killer. He grows up into a martial arts expert kicking arse in underground tournaments. When one day, a stranger appears and offers him the whereabouts of the Daddy Slayer in return for his employment in the Yakuza. He is looking for a man with his skills. And this is where the predictable twists begin. Now, the major flaw in all of this is the surprising lack of communication. The Yakuza boss knows of the new guy's father because they ransacked his apartment and found the news clippings. Once we get into the conspiracies, it soon becomes evident that if Snake Eyes had just turned to his new best bud and said, \"I saw my dad murdered, and I'm seeking revenge.\" The network of Ninjas who deal in spying and secrets could have easily helped him out - probably better than the Yakuza. And the story would have needed to take a different turn. So Snakey keeps his gob shut. Then he learns that the Ninjas aren't alone in their pursuit of peace; they are working alongside the GI Joes - an American/International information and military team. Come on - Snakey could have the Daddy Slayer in his hands before tea-time. Why do blokes have such a hard time opening up? I know - it's so the writers don't have to do any hard work thinking up new twists in the tale. Everybody could have lived happily ever after had Snakey spoken. That's not the only hindrance to the story. I was doing well until we got to the second of the three Ninja trials. What the bloody hell is that blue ball the blind master conjures up, and from where did it materialise? If there's magic now, why not use it against the attacking hordes. Send them all off to dreamland to face their deepest darkest fears. But sillier comes in the third trial and the shape of three mega-anacondas. These snakes are so massive I was wondering where they kept their chow. It was here I began to lose interest a tad.\n\nLuckily though, the director is a dab hand at action scenes. I cannot fault his work in the slightest - There are stimulating camera angles - Everything is naturally lit and visible - There's a minimum of shaky camerawork - And most of the fight sequences are shot full-body. As for the tempo, it's a near-perfect blend of varied paces - giving the audience a visual rollercoaster ride of fascinating excitement. Sadly, some of these action segments are wholly unbelievable, especially the car transporter fight. There is no way they could battle on top of the cars on the upper level of the transporter. No sooner would they try standing up than the wind's force would throw them clear off the vehicle to be mowed down by passing traffic. But, hey, it looks good. Actually, it looks a tad off. The CGI shading is wrong; this is more evident during the motorbike segments of the scene. It gives an unrealistic air to them, which pulled me out of the film a little, which, in turn, harms the picture and the viewer's involvement.\n\nThe cast is more than respectable in their portrayals. Though, Henry Golding, as Snake Eyes, does possess a reoccurring accent. It's strange because I'm sure he's American, but something is going on with his voice, and it started to bug me towards the end of the film.\n\nSnake Eyes was my Saturday morning breakfast viewing. And as such, my brain wasn't fully functional (still climbing of dreamland), which I found was a great way to watch the movie. If you like movies you don't need to think about because you merely want the excitement of the action, Snake Eyes is the flick to entertain you - It did me.\n\nPlease feel free to visit my Holding Out For A Hero and The Game Is Afoot lists to see where I ranked Snake Eyes.\n\nTake Care & Stay Well."

Peter Mensah and Iko Uwais were wasted. \u00darsula Corber\u00f3 was an engaging performer, though, again, wasted. Samara Weaving was, as expected, good. But, again, wasted, though I trust that she'll have a larger role in future movies.\n\nHaruka Abe did very well in her role, but she got a lot of screen time to work with compared to the others.\n\nMy only big complaint about this movie is that it predominantly consists of sword fights, but there is no blood. If you're aiming for a young audience, don't use bladed weapons.\n\nAs a mainstream movie aimed at general audiences, I give this movie 5/10. Maybe 6. For a movie aimed at kids in order to sell toys, I give this movie 7/10."

There are good visuals here but I think that's more inspiration from similar movies set in Japan (and other Kung Fu movies) and really Japan itself. I'm sure if you take a camera around Japan long enough you can get most of these shots anyways.\n\nI do like the character development between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. I knew Henry was a good actor but Koji really held up his own considering nearly all of his scenes were opposite Henry. I felt that the movie overall was well cast. I wouldn't mind seeing these actors reprise their roles in future G. I. Joe movies. The story is well told but I'm thinking most people won't like the story. I can't get into details without spoilers.\n\nI also want to mention that if you're a big G. I. Joe fan that this movie may not do much for you. The G. I. Joe elements felt wedged into the main story and could have easily been taken out. I do like the effort to have the tie-ins but it does feel like sequel-bating. Not everything can be a massive cinematic universe; Hollywood needs to calm down.\n\nThe worst offender is the action. It's not well coreographed nor well shot and edited poorly. It was so bad that it almost felt like they tried editing out a lot of the combat and just cut action scenes short for some reason. Does action look bad with Henry and they tried saving the movie? I guess we'll never know because there's so much shaky cam I could barely make out what was happening. I was wincing and shaking my head whenever another action scene came along; it was almost nauseating to watch.\n\nNow that the character is established, I'm hoping that if there is a sequel that it will be in a much more digestable story. Also, since everyone is complaining about it, get an action director with a steady cam and pull the action scenes away from whichever editor chopped up these scenes."

Before watching this movie in the cinema I made a bingo completely blind and got 10 out of 16 cliches, overused tropes, etc. Right. The ones I didn't get right were mostly about objectifying portrayals of women, so good job I guess. Getting back to the good aspects of the movie, I can count 5 if I'm generous, everything else is horrible or tiringly predictable. Worst of all not even the action is good. I can't think of a single thing this movie does that is unique. Now, many people would say that: \"oh, it's just a popcorn movie\", but there are already soo many of those, it is god damn time to make some actually good movies for a change. As for all the bad parts I don't even know where to start: the protagonist is unlikeable, the character development is forced and jarring; there is not even a single training sequence of snake eyes. IN AN ACTION MOVIE THAT IS MOST SIMILAR TO A **** SHONEN. He sucks at the start and sucks at the end. Performances are mediocre at best, music is... wait, what music, most characters have no character, it is all horrible. Please treat yourself to The Raid and The Raid 2."

The plot is average but I really don't expect much where action movies are concerned. I would say many of the fight scenes are done in an Asian style reminiscent of old Hong Kong movies from the eighties and nineties. This style is not for everyone, hence some low reviews. Both Henry Golding and Andrew Koji did a good job in their respective roles, even though I didn't care much for the other characters who were a bit cartoonish. I also was not a fan of the snake pit scenes which I found a bit cheesy. All that aside, I definitely think there are worse action movies out there."

A movie detailing the growth of Snake Eyes froma martial arts novice to an unstoppable expert only matched by Storm Shadow would have been excellent. There is no growth here. The same physical skills he had when discovered are unchanged. Instead he has a change of heart and considering the fact he had his arse handed to him by other martial arts experts that is not a good thing. How did he become the bad@$$ we saw in GI Joe? This is not explained. The action scenes were serviceable but many times the reason for the fight left a lot to be desired (So much so I was tempted to give this a 3).\n\nThe acting seemed forced and cartoonish. It was like they knew this movie was based off of a cartoon/comic book and acted as if it was. I went in with low expectations and this movie was worse than I thought it would be.\n\nIf you are just looking for occasionally good action this may be the movie for you. I will just say that the best action took place in act 1."

To be frank Henry Golding has the look but not the depth of acting talent to have a movie rest solely upon him, this deficit was self-evident in Monsoon. However for this, quite superficial role, he was well cast and raised up his game from the level of eye candy!\n\nSo much was good, the contrast of good and evil, the fight sequences, fighting granny, brother chemistry, supernatural events, styling, scoring the list is endless. But to my mind what made this great was the tongue in cheek light touch of the script and direction.\n\nI am not sure why there are so many mean reviews on here, but comic purists always find fault, well wake up and smell the coffee, art products must be judged on their individual merits as to whether they rise or fall, we must judge what is before us, not what we want or think should be before us, as this would be unfair!\n\nThe \"spirit\" brother Tommy, played by Andrew Koji was great as was the entire ensemble.\n\nI wasn't expecting much but this movie pleasantly over-delivered. It was a slow start but rose to a crescendo! I'm giving this a firm 7 for pure entertainment."

In showing the feud between two organizations (one being Cobra), the writers could have chosen a more meaningful storyline. You just don't care about the resultant feud between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, which is such a big part of G. I. Joe mythos.\n\nIn addition, the two actresses playing Baroness and Scarlett are terrible. There is just no way you would want to see an origin story of Baroness or Scarlett if they were playing these parts.\n\nStill, the film did have one good thing going for it. Andrew Koji as Storm Shadow."

Well...I didn't get that.\n\nThe movie I did get is a totally different story. Not a bad story, but disappointing to those who didn't want a different story.\n\nI believe I would've enjoyed this movie more if they just called it \"Ninja Movie\" and gave these characters different names. Atleast I wouldn't be judging it in a way that I'm comparing it to the source material. I know others feel this same way.\n\nI'd still say it was an enjoyable, one-watch-movie that you can go see on the big screen. Just don't expect a GI Joe story we know. I won't ever watch it again.

The na\u00efvet\u00e9 of some of them gets a little tiring by the third act, and how they make decisions, given the evidence of past consequences, seemed silly and unrealistic. But hey! It's based on a toy made into a cartoon, so, whatever. I get people giving this a 6 or even a 5, but a 4? Grow up. This franchise has experienced a stage of evolution that I'm certain Hasbro circa 1964 could've never even dreamt of. My only validifying acknowledgement of fan complaints is Snake Eyes not being, well, Snake Eyes (aesthetically), throughout the entire movie. He's shown on movie posters with the full getup and helmet, but that's absent in the film, except for a brief scene. Nonetheless, the progression of character development, especially by Andrew Koji, was very entertaining. As a Baroness \"fan\" myself, I was disappointed in her depiction, but it doesn't affect my rating at all. The movie as a whole deserves nothing lower than a 5.5."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is not a bad movie. The problem is that it is not a great Snake eyes movie either. The fist thing someone notice is that the main character is portrayed by an Asian actor instead of his western origin. This is not necessary bad but it may take you sometime to process it.\n\nSnake eyes is a skillful, cunning and accomplished character and all these are fulfiled at some level. However there are many unanswered questions regarding character's past and his training as a kid or his oath of silence. We see an already grown Snake eyes that sometimes seems powereless against other fighters and other masters despite that he is considered to be a grand master himself, expert in a dozen of martial arts. On the other hand there is some nice action that includes not bad choreographies and there is a decent plot that brings some surprises to the audience.\n\nSnakeeyes fans may not get fully satisfied but they may appreciate and enjoy that movie for its plot and its pace."

Now THAT was truly innovative... & the story was exceptional... even w/ the use of NO words! Everything about this movie was good all right... good & terrible. Horrible storyline... craptacular acting... just consistently subpar across the board. It doesn't even address why Snake Eyes never speaks, for crying out loud!!! Horrible direction to move the franchise, b/c Snake Eyes is w/o a doubt one of THE BEST characters, in the Joe fold. This movie is an absolute discredit & disgrace to both the mystique & mist that Snake Eyes is shrouded in!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I quite enjoyed the first G. I. Joe movie. They retconned it when making the second and they have completely wiped the slate clean for this.\n\nIf it an attempt to relaunch the brand - stop now and have a serious rethink.\n\nThis film is terrible, story, script, action, the works - terrible. My love for the old toys just pushed me to finish it. Every hint at the wider G. I. Joe universe, rather than making me keen for more, instead made me wince. The action had a few good moments but there was so much nonsense, it was probably more luck that some shots worked out OK.\n\nI'm already in the process of trying to forget I watched this film and hope that if Hasbro were willing to wipe the slate clean, they will do it again. There is so much opportunity with the franchise.\n\nA shame as I'm a fan of Andrew Koji. His portrayal of Storm Shadow was good but let down by terrible writing/story. I'll admit the trailer didn't give me much hope and it was only Andrews involvement that made me click play.\n\nReset and try again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Snake Eyes: G. I. Origins is the thrilling adventure of a lifetime and the perfect origin story to such a beloved character. With motorcycles, swords and a mystical gem - you will be a part of an incredible mission.\n\nThe movie is a spin-off around the character of Snake Eyes (Henry Golding). Holding onto the trauma of his father being murdered, Snake Eyes is on the hunt for his father's killer. He trains with the Arashikage clan to become a top ninja. Meanwhile, he makes a deal with some unlikely allies to find his dad's murderer.\n\nSnake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins is an action-packed movie and is not to be missed. The fight scenes are incredibly filmed, using long one-take shots to capture the film's actors fighting with swords. The cinematography is iconic, with some night scenes shot with bright neon lights and others with a calming, peaceful, bright light. It's so cool to watch modern-day ninjas on motorcycles fighting one another on the streets. This film is perfect for fans all around the world that enjoy amazing battle sequences, especially for G. I. Joe fans. Familiar faces are shown like the Baroness and Kenta. We also see a teaser for Snake Eyes' most popular villain, which leaves the movie open for a very exciting sequel. The film is a wonderful origin story, telling the tale of Snake Eyes, showing just how he became affiliated with the Joes and where he's off to next, while sprinkling in some major plot twists.\n\nThe moral of the story is to trust yourself and always do the right thing. Many times Snake Eyes is tempted to kill his father's killer and throughout the film he learns the meaning of honor - to others and yourself - and makes a surprising choice. He also learns how to find inner peace with many of the things he's done and moves on to the next chapter of his life.\n\nI give Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters July 23, 2021.\n\nBy Heather S., KIDS FIRST!"

        "review_title": "Close But No Cigar",
        "review_detailed_main": "Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins is a good movie that could have been better had the filmmakers decided to build the universe and give meaning to the mask. Henry Goulding is fantastic as Snake-Eyes, and the social media whining about his ethnicity is the kind of stuff that's suited for less evolved minds, so I have no patience for that complaint. But for the fan who is concerned about the core story of Snake Eyes as a disfigured military veteran, that is a valid concern that alters the dramatic tension of this film.\n\nThe Good: The Modified Origin Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins works as an astonishing Yakuza tale with the looming influence of COBRA. Snake Eyes and Tommy (who is later revealed as Storm Shadow in the film's trailer) have a fraught brotherly relationship that allows the orphaned mix martial arts fighter to join a secret clan of ninjas that protect society. There's the usual test of character trails you've seen in many martial arts films, and these are unique in their own right. In the dual-agent nature of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadows' relationship and the betrayals that underlie their relationships, the story is the strongest.\n\nThe Bad: The Introduction of GI Joe Scarlett O'Hara's intro is a direct rip-off from Black Widow's Avenger's interrogation scene. And Scarlett and the Baronesses sultry femme fatale act is a bit dated, overacted, and feels out of place in this film. You welcome their presence because it connects the universe, but at the same time, it's so poorly utilized that you don't care at all other than the first few moments they appear.\n\nI bring up Scarlett because fans of the comics and the 80's TV series know there's a strong bond between her and Snake Eyes. At no point do you get the sense that these two will become lifelong besties. They are as disconnected as two strangers on Twitter. And this is where the decision to change his origin story hurts the film. In the comics, Snake Eyes saves Scarlett during a helicopter crash, resulting in disfigurement and loss of speech. In the later years, she goes with him to experiment with plastic surgery procedures as Snake Eyes longs to have a love life of his own. I'm sure the producers didn't want to scar Henry Goulding's beautiful face. Still, the absence of that history makes their relationship topical and the arrival of his acclaimed mask...well, meaningless.\n\nThe Ugly The plot has a lot going for it when you pay attention to the themes the director is trying to convey. The conflicted nature of Snake Eyes makes him a bit of a jerk but still, one we can empathize with him. Where the story goes wrong is the introduction of the infamous secret weapon that you expect in a GI Joe movie, but it's so poorly introduced that it feels like an afterthought to create a more great third act. Another exploit of the snake theme already lies in a film about a man named Snake Eyes with an enemy known as Cobra. It's a bit hokey and unnecessary to the film; it also shows a lack of creativity by the filmmakers. The film also misses the mark to make the universe feel bigger. It's a smaller self-contained story which is fine, but it doesn't do enough to make you want to know more about the world awaiting Snake Eye's future.\n\nOverall: An fun pop-corn movie While it may seem like I'm hard on the movie, I'm rooting for it because I am a huge fan of GI Joe. A trip to my garage will reveal thousands of dollars of collectibles tied to that franchise. But Hasbro still hasn't figured out how to use this franchise in a way that makes it to the next level. Because there is a lot that's done well in this film, the cinematography is just suitable for this world--gritty enough to add tension but stylish enough to feel like a comic-book-themed universe. The actors are practical, not perfect. And the action is reasonably well done. So there's still a lot of work to be done before GI Joe lands it big at the box office."

Social media regularly outs many in our culture as entitled, ignorant, and entirely self-absorbed. I should have known better, reading all the reviews I thought the movie was going to be a major bomb, I mean Suicide Squad levels of cinematic malaise and incompetence.\n\nThen I watched it and two things stood out, other than Samara Weaving, (Hugo Weavings niece) not to many Americants are going to recognize this Asian heavy cast, save for maybe Uko Uwias, which is great! A Yakuza movie SHOULD be set in Japan and have a majority Asian actors.\n\nThe second issue is at time the movie seems like an A- or B+ production, and that is going to upset the clueless, Social Media crowd, who think every rebooted hot property should have at minimum, $200 million dollar budgets, and a script that follows the Kevin Fiege way.\n\nNo thanks to corporate made \"Happy Meal\" movies, and while this isnt a top notch Hollywood production, I enjoyed this more way more than WW84 or the last 3 Marvel produced movies I've seen."

The result was a mixed salad of poor writing, pitiful dialogue, freshman level acting, and a dull storyline.\n\nDuring one shot we were exposed to the first glimpse of the infamous Cobra logo on the inside of a crate full of weapons. That and that alone was the only element that peaked my interest in what became two hours of me looking at my watch and being thankful that I only paid for the matinee.\n\nWhat will it take for someone to put together a script that actually does justice to the GI Joe genre? Maybe Disney should just buy the label up and create a Joe Universe (GIJU) in which we can see the characters truly develop and the creation of a world that brings to life the GI Joe/Cobra battle on a true global scale."

Henry surely was quite happy to get the role - if you are not too happy about the end result, I am quite certain that it is not his fault or you will not blame him (at least not mainly).\n\nThe action is well choreographed - the story is quite paper thin, but I don't think people expect anything different. Be aware what this will serve you ... and deal or rather decide if you want to watch or not."

If you want an origin story then keep it simple. Save your Marvel-like story ideas after you passed the first Iron Man story at least.\n\nSo the story is too hard to follow. Do the characters make sense? No, not really either. One of the strangest choices of casting. Most if the characters are so obviously american that in Japan, in a secluded clan of ninjas, you can hear west coast accents. Was getting some Japanese actors too hard? Also I can't shake this feeling of hypocrisy from the studio: too afraid to hire a blond american for the role, but hiring a South Asian actor, who is clearly recognizable in Japan, to play a ninja while in a clan the seems to speak more English than Japanese. Is this not cultural appropriation and stereotype? I wonder... i haven't felt this level of cringe since Scarlett Johnson was cast as Major Motoko."

The fault of this monstrosity is not due to the acting.\n\nAlright, so this is NOT the Snake-Eyes origin. This is pretty far from it. This is a Snake-Eyes \"inspired\" movie. Whomever wrote this pile, either had no clue as to who the characters really were... or simple didn't give a damn and disrespect them and the fans.\n\nIf you have been a fan of Snake-Eyes or G. I. Joe in general, from the original comics or cartoon, then do not watch this. If you weren't or couldn't care less about it, I still warn you this is not a good movie. The writing really is atrocious. There are holes all over the place, and even suspending your disbelief will not allow you to accept a lot of what they try to shove down your throat.\n\nThe action could be good, if they let you see it. Whomever decided that these camera shots would lend well to the action, didn't have a clue. It hides a lot of the action, which the actors seemed to be able to provide. So why take away from that?\n\nI will say Golding's accent came out way to often. Which is one critique I would provide. That said, the actors all seemed to do their jobs well, despite the terrible writing.\n\nThe cheesy 80's action movie item of power was just so cringeworthy, that you simply lose all hope that they maybe... just maybe, pull this out of the toilet and turn it around. Which may be a good thing, as any more disappointment of this sacrilege could push you to slit your proverbial wrists to put yourself out of your misery.\n\nIn the end, I wouldn't suggest this to anyone. And to the studio, don't ever let whomever wrote this garbage... to ever write for this kind of movie again. Don't disrespect the IP or the fans like this. You want our money, but you've lost our trust. Why would we want to watch anything more you put out? I know you won't be getting my money again. Not unless I find out you knock the next 2-3 out of the park. You didn't even hit the ball on this one."

Being a martial arts fan, I was excited about a movie that focused on him. Not what I was hoping for! The story was okay, a bit boring for the first half hour, but I was more interested later. There was a serious lack of women, although there were some brief female appearances that I enjoyed. There was an opportunity to see the ladies kick some ass but instead they chose to jump cut to show only the result of the fight, leave the viewer to imagine what happened in between. Hallo, it's an action movie, I want to actually see the fight?! @)#&!\n\nWhich brings me to the action in this film, that unfortunately left me very disappointed. To be fair, there were a lot of fights, but I could barely see what was happening! The camera was all over the place during the action scenes. I've seen this happen so often in other films and series that it makes me wonder if they're intentionally trying to hide it because it's not that great. Adding to the mix, close ups in the wrong places, group fights, simultaneous fights going on, it was big mess and I couldn't follow or enjoy any of the choreography.\n\nI can't think of a single fight scene that made feel that adrenaline I remember from movies like Jet Li stepping into a room full of martial artists in Fist of Fury and Kiss of The Dragon, or the first two Transporter movies with Jason Statham, or even the long fight scene in the first Kingsman movie. Or the gun fights in John Wick. How I miss this sort of action, and no one seems to deliver anymore. All I got in this movie is an incomprehensible salad of sword fights I couldn't follow, sigh. Well, if they genuinely tried, I am thankful for the effort, but my craving for action remains."

        "review_detailed_main": "*Disclaimer there are no spoilers in this review* I don't usually agree with a lot of reviews in movies (mostly the negativity) but I actually agree with the bad reviews on this one. There's is to much confusion that wasn't cleared up in this movie and the lack of storyline. Now I've never read any of the comic books for G. I. joe. But I do know the storyline for snake eyes based off the comic book. The movie did not go by the G. I joe comics what so ever. I've never actually given a negative review. But here are a few ideas of what's wrong with it.\n\n1) It doesn't explain how snake eyes became snake eyes and if you have seen any of the G. I Joe movies there were scenes when snake eyes was younger with storm shadow. So you knew they grew up together But it doesn't explain that or clarify any of that in this movie 2) Storm shadow and Snake eyes relationship is confusing and very hard to understand. Again if you have seen any of the other G. I joe movies you would know they grew up together. In the snake eyes movie it had a whole different point Of view and it made you think \"what?\" 3) the way snake eyes was trained didn't make any sense and was slow and didn't add up either 4) very slow at first and then towards the end was the \"big fight scene.\" 5) fight scenes where shaky at first which no one likes and was hard to keep track who was fighting who.\n\nFor a character that everyone loves like snake eyes. You need to have a strong movie and go off the other G. I joe movies which would only make sense and add up for this snake eyes movie. Advice for anyone who was apart of this movie if you ever are going to make another one don't screw it up.\n\nP. S the actors and actresses did very well though."

D.\n\nIn the film, Snake Eyes (Henry Golding) is allowed to join the clan after rescuing the future new leader of the Arashikage clan. Here he gets lessons to become a ninja. During these lessons, Snake Eyes is confronted by his past, causing the clan to question his honor and loyalty. To successfully complete his training, Snake Eyes must regain the clan's trust.\n\nThe script and eventual story of the film was written by Evan Spiliotopoulos. He had help from two other writers for this, because he was also busy with his own fan film The Unholy. Because of this pressure, he has finished the script of this film a bit messy.\n\nIn addition to the messy script, the film is also filmed somewhat messy. Most action scenes are filmed moving and zoomed in, so as a viewer you don't get a clear picture of what exactly is happening. Other scenes in which characters walk alone are even filmed flexibly, making it almost as if this film was filmed by a director just starting out. For example, the art of Asian martial arts is lost in this film.\n\nThe special effects in the film are also not believable. Some creatures show that they were placed in the film with CGI, as well as some flames and explosions. The film is also sometimes a bit too hastily put together where characters move from place to place at a rapid pace. If they had just started the scenes where the characters went, the final movie would have been clearer and shorter.\n\nDespite the lesser script and directing work, Henry Golding tries to make the most of his role. Together with Andrew Koij he does have good chemistry in the film, while with another character he suddenly jumps from a difficult to a passionate relationship. Other characters are in the film more in reference to the G. I. Joe series. Although fans of the G. I. Joe series can recognize the names of some of the characters, they often have to get used to the way they appear in this film."

The Snake Eyes character is kinda similar to Wolverine. Pit fighter, trying to find his place in the world, haunted by his past. This reimaging of Snake Eyes is a mix of that along with Han Solo. It's totally different than the Marvel version but I'm fine with it. I loved the action and the arc that the character goes through. It's very much like the 1st X-men where is not a ton of plot but mostly character development and dialog. It's good fun like a Fast and Furious movie. Everyone needs to lighten up and enjoy it."

Although some are underused, and their response to movie-situations is questionable at times.\n\nSadly, this is a very bland movie.. and as a G. I. Joe movie it is even worse! More so for the character of Snake Eyes (has to be seen to be understood, and a little investment on the character is required). This is because I didn't particularly enjoy the role given to the main lead and his development is undercooked. The story itself is nothing new (even with the addition of certain details). A configuration of things we've seen before many times making it not only predictable and a tad forgettable. And all in the service of a conclusion that is nothing short of a disappointment..\n\nIt's no wonder word of mouth didn't help, but it can still be watched. And I'll lower my expectations for the sequel, if it ever comes."

The writing is so damn bland that you won't care for a single character. Samara Weaving's there in a blink & miss role, and she's the only one in this mess who commands decent screen presence. The less about the main cast, the better. Henry Golding looks uncomfortable in the role of Snake Eyes and struggles to carry it all the way. I did like Andrew Koji's portrayal of Storm Shadow to an extent. The plotting is, however, the worst. How can you stage a ninja clan feud so terribly? Badly shot (too much shaky cam) and weirdly edited, the action scenes are not what you'd want from a G. I Joe movie. I thought this would make for a great popcorn actioner, but what I watched turned out to be one of the trashiest films of the year."

        "review_detailed_main": "Snake Eyes is a movie that simply fails to make use of what it's given.\n\nThe movie is too violent to really be a kid's movie, yet the plot it poorly written, shallow and predictable, and full of holes, so it doesn't work as a movie for adults either. It's like they couldn't decide if they wanted to make a movie for the kids who like the newer GI Joe shows, or the adults who grew up with the originals, and simply failed to live up to either.\n\nThe story is just bad. Honestly the original cartoon had more elaborate and well thought out plotlines. This was just cliche as hell and so by the numbers it's painful. The writing is terrible. No real banter, no real emotion beyond the ham fisted stuff they put in to try and give characters some sort of drive, but it just makes them feel horribly artificial. A lot of the decisions characters make are completely nonsensical. And there's just no real flow.\n\nThere's also a great deal of blunders, plot holes, and just mistakes made throughout. Things that make no sense. Not to mention the insanely annoying cliche of the guy who's trained for a month somehow being better than people who have dedicated themselves for years. So tiring to see characters pick up a weapon and suddenly being an unstoppable god.\n\nThe combat scenes are terrible. Just full of endless jump cuts so they're a chaotic mess with no real impact. Not only jumping between views of the characters but also jumping between different fights. It's painful trying to keep track of who's fighting who and just what's going on. When will directors learn to use actual choreographed fight scenes instead of a hundred 2 second pieces?\n\nThe special effects were lackluster. Nothing big was needed, but even what little they had just felt like an afterthought.\n\nIf you're a dedicated Joe fan, you might want to watch this for completion's sake... or just to make yourself angry. If you're not a fan, but just like action movies... there are thousands of vastly better movies you can enjoy. Definitely give this one a pass."

In the first scene we first see him as a young boy, then the movie fast forwards to him as an adult fighting in a cage. He's already a tough guy and knows how to fight and wins the match. Next action scene he's fighting ten guys at once. When he's given a sword, he already knows how to to use it like an expert. There is some physical training he gets later on, but it's all very brief with no sense of progression or accomplishment. He knows already how to do everything.\n\nFor an action movie, it's mediocre at best. It barely held my interest after the halfway point and the tie in with the GJ Joe and Cobra characters was clunky and in some scenes (with Scarlet or the Baroness) almost cringey."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm usually neither fond of superhero movies in general nor of the Marvel franchise in particular but Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins is a very positive exception for me and a movie that is much better than its lukewarm reception might indicate.\n\nFirst and foremost, this film is a feast of martial arts fans. Back in the seventies, there were four new martial arts films at the cinema every week but these days they are hard to come by. In this film, we see ferocious fist fights but also the use of daggers, pistols and swords and even some elements of magic. The choreography is stunning and the pace is at times breathtaking.\n\nUp next, the locations for this movie have been chosen with care. The film starts with a series of different locations from a cabin in the woods over a shady underground fighting circuit to a port infiltrated with criminals. Most of the movie however takes place in a Japanese ninja dojo that looks absolutely stunning. This starts with the traditional buildings and continues with the surrounding forests, gardens, temples and shrines. The settings are very detailed and ooze with atmosphere.\n\nThe acting performances are also very decent. It was a great pleasure to see Iko Uwais on the big screen again but he doesn't play a ferocious martial artist but rather a wise teacher in this film which suits him surprisingly well. The same could be said about Peter Mensah as a blind master whose words are filled with philosophy and wisdom. My personal highlight is however Abe Haruka who appears as an analytical security boss at first but turns out to be an empathic, foresightful and intelligent woman.\n\nThe story is also very interesting as it offers many twists and turns and makes viewers ask themselves how they would react under similar circumstances. If I were on a quest to avenge my family but were invited as a friend to a ninja dojo controlled by such a charismatic security boss, I would probably not pursue the path of betrayal.\n\nAt the end of the day, Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins is much better than its reputation and turns out to be a charismatic martial arts action film that should appeal to a much larger audience than those who are only interested in superhero movies."

Maybe that was the case. Either way. The movie was boring. Go watch the old Sho kosugi ninja movies instead. They may be cheesy, but at least the actors can fight and the filming is superb."

The camera footage is all over the place and was not steady at all! I thought they had the right actors for their parts, but the story was too rushed and without the story the whole movie falls apart.\n\nThis was not worth the $14.00 plus $10 more for Popcorn and soda, if this is what they are going to push out for movies than Streaming will wipeout the cinemas within 2 years. The G. I. Joe Series is D. O. A. (Dead on Arrival) with this one."

Many are used to the Snake eyes from the older films from the 2010s which I can't blame those who seen them but many forget his comic origin is different from the movie one. In the comics he lost his voice from a helicopter accident. Snake Eyes normally doesn't talk and so yes it was a shock to see him talk but you can't do a narration because narrating hasn't worked in movies for a while since I think the 80s maybe 90s. It made sense he'd talk plus in the older films he could talk as well when he was a child, he just took a vow he could easily do the same or Hasbro could do his comic book version or create something new. That's why people hate the film is because he talked."

He has a great origin story as depicted in 30 years worth of comics and cartoons. Reboot it, fine, but just do that. You have a wealth of source material. Seriously, how hard could it be? As this movie shows you, pretty darn hard.\n\nI am baffled how the team that made this movie could get everything wrong. They assemble a cast that can throw down and fight and the fight scenes are literally seconds long, mostly in the dark, with extremely quick cuts. The acting is sub-par but, to be fair, they weren't given much to work with. I think other reviewers are giving Andrew Koji a pass because of Warrior but he is super cheesy in the role of Storm Shadow. His performance is full of a forced, hammy earnestness as he delivers lines from a comic book movie that sounds like they were written by and for eight year olds. And speaking of eight year olds, one of the \"veteran\" screenwriters is a veteran of working on terrible Disney sequels like Cinderella 3, Tarzan 2 and Jungle Book 2. Oh, and he wrote 2 Pooh Heffalump movies. He DOES write for eight year olds and it shows here. The story is beyond juvenile and shows little understanding of what is great or interesting about the source material. Even the fan service is completely misplaced here. There is a scene late in the movie where Snake-Eyes walks up to Scarlett right before one of the climactic (non) fight scenes and casually says, \"Yo, Joe.\" But this is an ORIGIN movie and he barely even knows what G. I. Joe is at this point. How would he know to say that? I think the screenwriters were so inept at their craft that they thought they could take a movie about a ninja named Snake-Eyes and build it around a literal pair of dice that only rolls ones and three literal snakes. Anacondas. Not even Cobras.\n\nThis whole thing is a hot mess. And not even an interesting mess. A super bland and generic boring mess. It's Snake-Eyes. How do you do that? Thank God this movie tanked so bad that we will probably not be subjected to any more of this nonsense and Larry Hama won't have to pretend that he likes it."

The color pallet used for the movie was questionable to me as well, the dark scenes are really dark and the day scenes have some sort of a dark pallet to it as well.\n\nIf you came here for the action sequences, I think you would be disappointed here as well, there is nothing that stands out, add with the horrible dialogue between characters, it's a mess, making the movie 2 hour long didn't help it's case either, this could have been easily wrapped up in 90 minutes including credits and more creativity.\n\nAvoid this one at all costs, for the effort put in the movie by the actors I am giving this a 5/10, whereas there is a 4/10 for me."

Predictable and rather boring.\n\nBut the worst thing is that we don't learn to much about Snake Eyes. Really. This is his Origins? Yeah, in first scene we see that he's father was killed and hi fought in a cage. But that's it. How he became so good? In one scene he says that he is not a murderer, in other that he did horrible things. So which is it? Was he Yakuza's assassin or he was just packing fish? We learn nothing about his skills.

This one... not so much.\n\nIt could have been a really good movie but it ended up as a huge disappointment. The story should have been a cool revenge story but it ended up being a convoluted mess making Snake Eyes one of the bad guys for most of the movie. It is also hugely predictable after the first 20 minutes of the movie. Did the writers really think that the \"twists\" would come as a surprise for anyone? They probably did since Hollywod writers usually reside on the low end of the intelligence scale nowadays. Putting three of those hacks together to write a movie doesn't help of course.\n\nI could have accepted all of that if the rest would have been cool with lots of fights and special effects. Sadly the movie is mediocre, at best, in these areas as well.\n\nSnake Eyes is not only a bad guy but he is rather stupid as well as devoid of any charisma. His acting is quite poor which can be said for most of the actors actually. Apart from the mediocre acting there's really no one in the movie that you feel like rooting for. No one stands out, everyone just excels in mediocrity. The only person in the entire movie that has any coolness factor worth talking about is Scarlett but she is not in the movie for more than a few scenes.\n\nThere are a few scenes with some special effects, cars flipping over, huge snakes etc. But not really that much for this kind of movie. That could have been fine since this movie should be a lot about martial arts. Amazingly enough, not even here does it deliver. Most of the martial arts scenes involve a lot of flipping around with arms and swords but they mostly look like they have been written for a PG rated TV show for teens and pre-teens. They are simply poor. Tommy looks like he needs to take a dump before every fight with that ridiculous pose of his.\n\nThis is not a 1-star movie as some rate it. That's just ridiculous. It has some entertainment value. However, it could have been so much better. Unfortunately I suspect this movie has done the G. I. Joe franchise a disservice for some time to come."

        "review_detailed_main": "The G. I. movies Joe apparently didn't have as much of an impact as the movies in the Transformers franchise. So starting again from scratch, we have this spinoff focused on the origin of Snake Eyes that reboots the saga of G. I. Joe, as the origin story seen here about how the feud between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow came to be is not the same as the one seen in the Rise Of Cobra flashbacks. Without forgetting to mention that both these two characters and The Baroness and Scarlett O'Hara are played by other actors. This origin story is well written in the style of classic martial arts action movies and this movie manages to fit that category very well. You can see the evolution of Snake Eyes being at the beginning someone who is willing to do anything to avenge the death of his father. The friendship that he develops with Storm Shadow at the beginning and how he ends up getting lost is also well captured. Akiko is also well developed as the voice of reason who is suspicious of Snake Eyes being aware of the risk that she is present, but later bonding with him. The script offers a very good story in the pure anime style, with a good balance between the action, the evolution of Snake Eyes as a person and his internal conflict about whether to do whatever it takes to get revenge on him no matter the cost. As a martial arts action movie it's great and works very well. Unfortunately, it does not have the support it deserves. Of course it is a very different origin story, but since this is a reboot, this new story is valid, since the origin of the rivalry between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow has varied according to the different installments of the franchise that present different versions of the G. I. Joe, although maintaining certain characteristics. The reality is, you don't need to know all the G. I. Joe or be 100 percent faithful to the source material because each installment has its own version of the story. In addition, it is very evident that even though some claim to be loyal fans or specialized critics, it is very clear that they do not have the capacity to give a film the value it really deserves and that makes their arguments invalid. So all in all, Snake Eyes is actually a good movie that those with low IQs don't know how to appreciate. Since the live action Transformers has been split into 2 universes since Bumblebee came out, it's totally valid that this movie wanted to use the same formula. Therefore, this movie presents an alternate universe of G. I. Joe that it can be better or be at the level of the two previous films. After all, in the multiverse of Hasbro-created franchises, anything goes. My final rating for this movie is 9/10."

Snake Eyes is approached by Yakuza boss, Kenta Takamura (Takehiro Hira), approaches Snake Eyes and makes an offer that he will give him his father's murderer in exchange for working for him. Some time later Snake Eyes is working for Kenta's gun smuggling ring, until one of Kenta's underlings, Tomisaburo \"Tommy\" Arashikage (Andrew Koji) is revealed to actually be Kenta's cousin who's been trying to stop Kenta's illegal activities. When Snake Eyes disobeys an order to kill Tommy, the two escape to Japan where Tommy introduces Snake Eyes to his clan of Ninja and offers him a place there, much to the objection of the clan's head of security, Akiko (Haruka Abe). Now Snake Eyes must pass three trials from the clans mentors Hard Master (Iko Uwais) and Blind Master (Peter Mensah), while also navigating a convoluted web involving the Arashikage Clan, Cobra, and members of G. I. Joe with Snake Eyes caught in the middle.\n\nParamount since 2007 has had a lucrative partnership with toy company, Hasbro, with their initial adaptation of Transformers in 2007 getting the ball rolling on not only 5 follow-up films in that series, but also in adapting other well known legacy properties ranging from board games like Ouija and Battleship to other 80s toy properties like M. A. S. K. and Micronauts. A close second to Transformers in terms of popularity is the G. I. Joe with trying to jump start a film series in 2009 with G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. The Rise of Cobra while not a bomb, didn't pull in the Transformers levels of money the studio was expecting, leading to the \"soft reboot\" G. I. Joe: Retaliation which was beset by production problems and reshoots (particularly involving regret at killing off Channing Tatum's character fulling the actors surge in popularity with Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street) and again lead to \"okay\" returns at the box office, but still well short of Transformers money. Despite the mixed reception of those movies, the one element that was pretty universally liked was in the film's handling of the character Snake Eyes as played by Ray Park. Like the cartoon and comic book, Snake Eyes doesn't talk and most of his personality comes from his body language and mystique and the films did a good job incorporating him as part of an ensemble and giving resonance to his long standing feud with Storm Shadow. When Paramount announced a spin-off of this character who doesn't speak, I'll admit I had reservations, but with Bumblebee managing to exceed my expectations I was willing to give it a chance. Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins is unfortunately a step backwards for this series that wasn't exactly firing on all cylinders to begin with.\n\nHenry Golding does fine in his first outing headlining a major action film, as he's a charismatic presence with charm and likability, but I had a hard time buying him as Snake Eyes. I don't think this is Golding's fault per se, and I'm not opposed to having Snake Eyes talk in an origin story, but at no point did I feel like the character we were seeing was Snake Eyes. The movie at it's core plays like a mixture of an 80s Ninja movie crossed with one of those noir movies where a westerner goes to explore Japan's criminal underworld (The Yakuza, The Challenge, etc.) only without the cheesy fun of the former or the craft and gravitas of the latter. Most of the film's characters are played like stiffs with very little in the way of energy or drive. I did enjoy the performances by the underutilized Iko Uwais and Peter Mensah as Hard Master and Blind Master respectively, and honestly would've liked to see more of them in the movie training Snake Eyes. The movie does come to life when it gets a bit sillier in its final act with Cobra's Baroness and G. I. Joe's Scarlett played by Ursula Corbero and Samara Weaving respectively, but there presence is so jarring in comparison to the deliberately paced and stoic first 3/4ths of the movie by the final act it barely feels like we're even in the same film as when we started.\n\nSnake Eyes is unfortunately a boring take on the popular G. I. Joe character. Despite Henry Golding doing his best to light up his performance, he's dragged down by a bloated convoluted script that doesn't carry enough weight with its characters to resonate. The action is serviceable, but with a two hour run time carry a messy plot and confused character motivations I found myself checking the time and getting antsy by he 1 hour mark."

Three big multi-million blockbuster attempts to make one decent GI : Joe film - I mean really...clearly he has NO tability in making quality films. This film, most likely - as others speculate - was probably made in a hurry to retain the rights of the franchise which he should just let go of.\n\nHe should feel ashamed at this terrible waste of money that could have been put to something useful and good into the world. Look at his CV over the past 10 years....nothing of any QUALITY. Sure, he can get some bums on seats with good marketing - but he makes AWFUL films and this is another he can add to the list. Just give it up and let some younger, talented producers/film-makers take the reins from now.\n\nI say this because I have been an extra on several of his productions including this one in one of the opening scenes - the atmosphere was horrible and no one was happy. The actors and crew were doing their best - most of the fighting I saw must have ended up on the cutting room floor because I saw none of it in the final product. It was actually quite dangerous for people doing the action and it wasn't even worth if unfortunately. Other sets I work on are so much better in almost every way. I would say steer clear of this man's films\n\nAs for the film itself - the cast do a good job - I can never buy Henry Golding as an action tough guy - he's too soft and certainly not my Snake eyes - I remember his double was used a lot too - which is probably why they needed to cut a lot I guess. The writing is awful and plot holes galore - how mature decision making adults could have read the script and thought it was a good idea to go ahead with is beyond me. People are speculating Golding was a replacement for Charlie Hunman who would have been way better.\n\nThis film had the possibility of being good but with terrible decision makers up top - it'll never happen and they'll waste so much money and lead so many people on with false advertising - it needs to stop."

        "review_detailed_main": "The title is the quote the film completely lost me with around 90 minutes in.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it wasn't that engaging before that point. But the first 20 minutes were actually ok, all the Yakuza port stuff was pretty good if not for the shaky cam.\n\nWhile watching it, I felt like I was trying to like it more than I should. It was almost like it was trying to get good, but never quite reached that point.\n\nThere are lots of weird things going on in this production in general. First of all - Robert Schwentke. The name rang a bell so I checked and yes - I've seen Der Hauptmann. Why Snake Eyes? I don't know, maybe it's the paycheck. Then there are weird tonal jumps, serious and gritty (but basic) mob-revenge plot mixed with magic giant anacondas (and flying grandmas). I understand the simplicity of the source material, but why make it as serious at times? Kids won't enjoy it since the actions scenes are mostly short and shot with shaky cam. Adults are never going to take this story seriously, especially after the clownery of the past 90-minute mark. After the magical reunion, it just became a complete farce.\n\nI think that this film was salvaged by all the talented people that were in it. Andrew Koji was a saving grace of this film, I liked his acting a lot. Then there's Iko Uwais, but they mostly wasted his skills since we barely see him doing anything. The CGI was surprisingly good for such a film also.\n\nSnake Eyes is extremely unlikable and gives you no reason to root for him. Maybe this was intentional, but his ark never feels accomplished.\n\nThe film had a couple of nice sets, although I'd wish they would have all the Japanese scenery set in wintertime, that would've been great. Also, I had a feeling that the film was set in the 90ties but when it came to product placement it suddenly switched to modern-day cars, embarrassing.\n\nI didn't like any of the other cast besides Takehiro Hira as Kenta. Baroness was a joke, Scarlett's presence in the film wasn't justified at all, just have more giant anacondas instead.\n\nOverall, I can't say I expected anything at all, and there was no reason for the film to exist. It's not like there is a demand for G. I. Joe origins whatever-verse. In the end, I just feel sad about the talent of the film. Hope everyone was well-paid for this."

The people that are supposed to end up as the bad guys are almost the good guys while the good guy is basically a bad guy. As I said, they must have taken a script, and applied a G. I. Joe label on it.\n\nThat said, the only reason to watch this movie is to see a cool action movie, and even then it falls short. People draw swords and start kicking one another. People with guns run up to try and shoot someone point-blank only to have the gun knocked away as they get punched. People can jump off moving vehicles, over other moving vehicles, and land on yet another moving vehicle. There's the suspension of disbelief and then there's just magic now because the director says so. This movie also makes joining a ninja clan look as easy as signing up at your local dojo."

And one thing that was good despite any logical expectation is that they made both characters completely OOC but somehow it worked exactly the same way as in the original story because you can FEEL the heartwrenching potential of what could've been.

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was enjoyable. Not perfect, but I think it deserves more credit. It would have been something that I would have really enjoyed as a kid in the 90's (I was a big GI Joe fan as a kid, but it was so long ago, I barely remembered it). The movie's strong points are its action sequences, the good looking filming locations and set, and the Japanese culture inside the film. The casting was great, the actors did a good job (and many of them are pretty good looking as well). I really enjoyed the underground Japanese theme and scenery, the streets of Japan mixed with traditional Japanese towns. I think the storyline and script could have been a little better, and there were a couple of oddities in the film which I thought were very weird and the film didn't really explain it (but I understood they had limited time for a movie, I'm sure there's a lot of deleted and extra scenes). The lead actor, Henry Golding, did a great job; he is always enjoyable to watch on the screen.\n\nI think many hardcore retro and comic enthusiasts are mad that the lead character is not white like how it was originally supposed to be in the original franchise, but I don't think they realize that Henry Golding is half white and has a white father in real life (though Henry Golding does look more Asian). I'm actually glad they casted an Asian lead character, I felt that it worked out very well with the casting and I can't imagine it being someone else. Many films in the past like Dragon Ball Z, Avatar: The Last Air Bender, and Ghost in the Shell live action films all had white lead actors, many Asian people felt very upset about all of these films that cast a white character in place for an Asian character, and the lack of Asian lead characters in mainstream western films. The only issue is the script and storyline which could have used improvement (which I mentioned earlier). But the overall film, especially the action sequences, was very good and enjoyable. I think people sometimes get way too into movies and critique and nitpick every single small thing about the film, but at the end of the day, a movie is entertainment and I was definitely entertained well enough. To be fair, this movie was way better than the last two GI Joe films which were disappointing, so I think they did a much better job this time with this origin story film. There are many films that get very user review high ratings but I didn't really like those films that much, and there are films that had low review ratings but I ended up enjoying it and thought it was decent. So film reviewers have their biases, I rate based on entertainment value."

Andrew Koji is fantastic is his arch nemesis 'Storm Shadow' and we see how they go from blood brothers to arch enemies.\n\nThe usually dependable \u00darsula Corber\u00f3 (Tokyo from Money Heist) was given precious little to work with in a villainous role, with the writing wearing this on too many occasions. With cliches twists and repetitive action sequences that fail to wow you, 'Snake Eyes' reduces to a tiring watch.\n\nWith the wide canvas of a fresh GI Joe origin story open to him, it is criminal that the director wasn't able to paint a better picture of the beloved children's toy series. Samara Weaving is abysmal as the Joe agent 'Scarlett' and Takehiro Hira is more comical than menacing as the diabolical 'Kenta'.\n\nA big let down, especially given how much of a fan following this character has.

The more you had didn't matter unless it was with the most recent release. When Star Wars figurines finally landed in the big supermarkets in the 'burbs, after a long stint in select hobby shops usually in the City Centre, the craze peaked!\n\nThe G. I. Joe's were what you'd take to school, but not just for show and tell! If you lost at marbles you could bet your figure, and those stakes couldn't be higher...for a 10 year old!\n\nSo when the first G. I. Joe films fizzled through theatres, I was a bit less disappointed than Star Wars Episode I, which is still pretty peeved! My G. I. Joe was never so...blah!\n\nBut Snake Eyes, the hardest toy to find, as a film hit my high mark! Shallow storyline pales with the amazing swordplay and martial arts on offer.\n\nHenry sells the part, and finally warms your heart as he grows and learns. For a journey that takes a villian and transforms him into an unsung hero, this one ticks all the boxes.\n\nPopulated by unknown actors for the mainstream western viewers, but not for Asian film buffs, a handful of familiar faces spruce up the assemble cast. Notably, Tokyo from the Netflix smash hit Casa De Papel (Money Heist) ironically shows up when Snake/Henry goes to Japan's capital city of the same name! Even her English surprised and amused me after her gorgeous Spanish! But I digress!\n\nSnake Eyes contains the basic, well known fundamental morals that prop up the ninja folklore. Namely trust, honour, honesty, and heritage, heritage, heritage! These were no cheap mercenaries like the secret US government's organisation used to Control Chaos. Or vice versa! Snake has to infiltrate this close-knit army of deadly acrobats for nefarious reasons we learn as we follow him.\n\nMotorcycle chases that will leave your knees shaking and your knuckles white, bookended by a choreographed cartop freeway fight scene that would rival Matrix Reloaded's and you've got yourself a pretty good entry into the rebooted franchise! Let's hope future instalments stear less towards Avengers and more to the ninja-honest cartoons' origins!\n\nI loved the culturally appropriate representation (not a white ninja in sight)!\n\nIt made me want to go back and watch the less appealing ones!"

The filmmakers know what kind of movies they are and they run with it.\n\nSnake Eyes is a reboot of the series and i was pretty excited to see it but in the end i thought it was shallow and actually pretty boring. The tone of the movie is a lot more serious this time around but this just makes it unintentionally funny in places and the action is really messy and tame.\n\nI mean it features Iko Uwais from The Raid who is an immensely skilled martial artist but the movie barely lets him do anything and so many times during the action scenes just as it's about to get cool the camera cuts away to something else. This is lame as hell.\n\nIt's supposed to be the origin story of a G. I Joe character but the whole G. I Joe element seems like it's shoehorned in. If it wasn't there the movie wouldn't be any different.\n\nAlso Henry Golding keeps forgetting his American accent, so many times he just flat out speaks in an English accent and i was like \"Oh!

I feel terribly for the people who actually paid good honest money to watch this tripe in the theatres.. The shallow and predictable story made zero sense, the actors were terrible - I've seen blocks of wood with more emotion and conviction, not to mention the dialogue was absolutely cringeworthy; it's as if the guy who writes fortune-cookie wisdom wrote the script. The action and fight scenes - which is the real reason why anybody would want to see this - were few and far between and when they did come, they were so random and really not anything we haven't seen before so basically just terrible. However, I do feel Iko Uwais was completely wasted, he basically had nothing to do, he barely got to use his martial arts skills. Other wasted actors include: Ursula Corbero who does amazing work outside of this movie, same with Samara Weaving. If this was supposed to be the origin story of Snake Eyes, it was also his ending; and why the hell did they change his backstory from the established canon? Were they trying to be clever or something? This POS of a movie made the Stephen Sommers G. I. Joe movies seem like works of art."

        "review_detailed_main": "Released: July 23rd, 2021 Viewed: July 28th, 2021\n\nLooking back over the last 12 years, since the first GI Joe film came out (GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra - 2009), the landscape, that this type of film inhabits, has changed some since then. In the years since 2009, a new type of film-franchising has taken the world by storm. Of course, I am talking about the cross-over franchise universes that are the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DC Extended Universe. Both have managed to create self-contained film/TV universes, teaming with characters and worlds, full of stories to tell, for the next many decades to come. It even has helped earlier franchises, such as Star Trek and Star Wars, find/expand their franchise limits even further as well. Heck, even the Legendary Pictures Godzilla/Kong Monster-verse seems to be working also. Looking at this new form of film franchise creation, from a Hasbro production perspective, creates a certain problem for the success of this film.\n\nWhen looking at Hasbro's success since the first Transformers (2007), came out, the money is definitely there, but the critical response has been a difficult road for the toy/entertainment giant. That is the part we want to concentrate on here and not the monetary value of the IPs. We should be honest here and say that Hasbro's best film was Battleship (2012), which never got a sequel and maybe, half of the Transformers movies were better than fair. We also should note that, the first two GI Joe movies were not really great either. Could Hasbro do something to correct the course that this seemingly damaged IP has? Can it learn a lesson from what came before it without being a modern day film clich\u00e9? What really is worse is, these are just the beginning of the hurtles that Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins (2021), needs to face in order to be good.\n\nSnake Eyes picks up on many film clich\u00e9s, new and old, such as, the fact that it copied the X-Men Origins concept by making it GI Joe Origins. I saw some Guy Ritchie inspired text placements (see Wrath of Man - 2021), throughout this film. Many of the motorcycle scenes looked like they were pulled right out of Akira (1988). It even had the standard superhero lineup that happens right before the big climactic fight scene commences. There's even an after credits scene. In fact this totally looked like a carbon copy of a Marvel attempt. Also, don't release this film in a year that is already teeming with Asian-inspired, action-type, plot lines. We just saw the release of the Mortal Kombat (2021), remake. A new Kung Fu (2021), show just debuted on the CW. Plus, we have been gearing up for the last 18 months for the soon to be released Marvel film, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021). There is going to be content saturation that will effect originality.\n\nThe producers try to salvage the GI Joe film series by placing all its hopes on exploring the origin of one of its main characters. The problem stems from the fact that this type of character has been seen before and may not be as original an idea after all. They decide to pick a character, who is mostly a faceless, dark, shadowy, ninja type of persona. He is always seen that way in the GI Joe films, known for wearing a dark black hooded mask, who usually doesn't say much either. Now we have a backstory about this guy, which doesn't hold your attention much, because the character was so one dimensional already. We learn how he becomes Snake Eyes and what contributions the snakes play into his story, but that aspect starts to counteract the whole original form of the character. You begin not to care. It is a GI Joe story, but it becomes boring and dull. There are some good action scenes that seem hampered at times by the slow script. The excellently choreographed stunts begin to look all too familiar.\n\nThat by no means implies that this is a horrible film. Not by a long shot. There are some good points to this film. Some interesting aspects that make it compelling to watch. If you look at this film based on basic technical film principles then it is a perfect film. It has all the polish, professional perfections that any Hollywood film made today has, but after 125 years of movies, that isn't always enough. The film was way too long and when we finally get to the part of the movie centered around that pivotal moment when we finally learn the GI Joe connection with Snake Eyes, is fumbled. That great moment when these two huge pillars of the plotline first meet, becomes almost an afterthought.\n\nWhat saves this film is the excellent acting by the superb, almost completely, Asian cast. One of the great aspects of Snake Eyes, who is from Asian-descent, named after a pair of dice, is completely American (since he was captured as a young child and grew up in Los Angeles), gets thrown into a situation in this film taking him all the way to Japan and he can only speak English. He is that real American hero, who needs his captors, allies and enemies to speak English to him or else those big speeches at the start of fights won't fall on deaf ears. So by casting a good, competent, professional group of Asian actors, who can articulate their lines well for the main character, as well as, for the audience, is done quite well in this film. The acting is top notch in this one. It brings in the non-perfect, human aspect of the equation, that makes Snake Eyes' character more interesting.\n\nThere also are many cool camera shots of Tokyo and other surrounding areas of Japan. I enjoyed some of the action scenes that did have an aura of familiarity to me. I am giving Snake Eyes an E+ for Effort and I still recommend seeing the film in theaters to support the excellent work of the Asian cast. GI Joe fans might like this exploration into their most famous and popular character, but for everyone else in the audience this film may feel too long, familiar and at times boring. I just hope GI Joe fans weren't as mad as I was when that pivotal moment, when Snake Eyes learns about the Joe Organization, ends up being less exciting then a yawn. The snakes were silly too, but nerve-wracking.\n\n5.2 (E+ MyGrade) = 5 IMDB."

I feel like this was one of those movies where 10 years down the road they're going to look back and go \"wtf?\" and remake it. Hopefully.\n\nThey really had a chance to tackle one of the coolest characters ever. A chance to explain why he is what he is, where he came from, how he feels, etc. Unfortunately, all of that lasts all of about 15 min of the film.

This is for kids and grownups like myself that watched the old show in the 80s. If you're looking for something else, then move on.\n\nMy only gripe is the use of the F word. You have the entire movie going at 100% and then you drop a random unnecessary F bomb? That was just dumb. Otherwise a good movie that certainly would have made money if not for the pandemic...... and the f bomb. \u270c\ud83c\udffe"

        "review_title": "Another bad attempt at starting a GI Joe movie franchise",
        "review_detailed_main": "GI Joe was never my thing when I was growing up. My only experience with this IP was the two big blockbuster GI Joe movies and they were terrible. Snake Eye was the best aspect of those terrible movies though as he was a badass mute ninja. I was a little surprised and intrigued when it was announced that there would be a prequel/reboot focused on him before he was mute. The premise is \"An ancient Japanese clan called the Arashikage welcomes tenacious loner Snake Eyes after he saves the life of their heir apparent. Upon arrival in Japan, the Arashikage teach him the ways of the ninja warrior while also providing him something he's been longing for: a home. However, when secrets from Snake Eyes' past are revealed, his honour and allegiance get tested -- even if that means losing the trust of those closest to him\". So is the Snake Eye origin a story worth telling or is it just another bad attempt at the GI Joe franchise?\n\nFirstly, Henry Golding is good as the titular character. It is clear that Henry is giving 100% in every scene. There is an emotional moment in the final act and Henry gives a very convincing performance during it. Andrew Koji is also great as Tomisaburo Arashikage/Storm Shadow. He has a really strong voice and presence that is great to watch. I also love the moments between Henry's Snake Eye and Andrew's Storm Shadow. The chemistry between the two is great and it does feel like they were close friends or brothers. I also really like the gorgeous set design from the Japanese style of the Arashikage base to the neon-filled city. There is also a pretty good action sequence with long takes in the rain at a neon-drenched alleyway that was visually good to watch.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the action sequences in this film are forgettable. The director, Robert Schwentke, implements shaky cam during close-ups of fights and also uses a ton of quick cuts which ruins the scene. It's such a shame as the alleyway fight scene shows that he could easily do entertaining fights but doesn't. The music score is also very generic with this electronic thump sound throughout the movie that occurs in action and even non-action scenes.\n\nThe biggest issue with this movie has got to be the terrible screenplay and story. The titular character, Snake Eyes, is an unlikeable main character that is difficult to root for. Without spoiling things, he does questionable things for the sake of revenge for the death of his father. Additionally, his redemption arc happens right at the very end of the movie and by that point, I could not like his character anymore. He didn't deserve any forgiveness whatsoever. Furthermore, Tomisaburo becomes the famous GI Joe villain, Storm Shadow, through some stupid logic. The first two acts of the movie is a grounded ninja, martial art movie but the final act is a tonal shift with it feeling more in line with superhero movies with silly magical power garbage.\n\nOverall, Snake Eyes: GI Joe origins is the best GI Joe movie so far but it is still a bad movie. This movie succeeds in ruining the titular character by turning him into a dumb idiot. It also has forgettable action sequences that feel more aligned with generic action movies than the famed martial art movies. I don't know if this will get a sequel or another reboot in 10 years but I hope the next entry is a lot better than this..."

Joe while growing up and there have been other memorable cartoons like He-Man and Masters Of The Universe and the 80's Spider-man cartoons.\n\nSo I don't know a lot about the backstory of all these characters. As a newcomer watching this movie, the feeling of it is like a sci-fi ninja film at some times with elements of mythology and the supernatural. They have crossed many genres making this one.\n\nThe film is not that dull and will hold your attention but after starting to watch this one you will feel a compulsion to finish it and find out what happens at the end.\n\nFor me the farcical parts of the movie were just plain ridiculous and when it turned to the mythological from being a straight-up ninja film, I knew that the ending would be pointless, but I sat through till the very end.\n\nFor those who have watched that cartoon series in the '80s, no doubt you will be sorely disappointed. It is nothing like what you have been used to before. Still in a manner of speaking it is better than the Black Widow movie I have seen."
