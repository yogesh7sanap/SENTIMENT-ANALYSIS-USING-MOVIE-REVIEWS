The first one was garbage too, but at least it had some kind of story to drive it, this movie is basically as 2 hour music video with sex.... yes, that's all it is. The relationship between the two leads is as mindless and unrealistic as the first, and another man joins the scene, who is just as dull as the first.\n\nNothing happens in this film until roughly half way through, and if you even managed to endure the pain that is the awful dialogue, directing and acting, you then have to suffer a boring thriller-wannabe. It's a shame really, because with a good director and writer, you could have had a compelling story with good characters, but no...we get this. The main actors, (I can't even be bothered to look up their names) have little to no chemistry between them, and half of the time they are just standing there looking pretty.\n\nI understand that 20-40 something men aren't this movies target audience, but at least make it bareable for us.\n\nIf you were to take out all the music and sex, you would have a 40 minute short film. Seriously, it's that bad. So many usless scenes that add nothing. The only good thing about this movie is its cinematography, which is surprislingly very good, which is the only thing stopping this from getting a 1."

I think it was an easy way out, to leave movie 1 on a huge cliff hanger, and just continue movie number 2 like that didn't happen. And if the movie makers thought fans loved the sex, they totally didn't get why. It was the context and the story that made the sex hot. You can't just have a long music mashup with soft porn and no story line or romance building up the tension. Where's the foreplay? Common!"

Bad acting, no plot, and an absurd runtime for what it has. No wonder Netflix is losing subscribers, it has more unoriginal garbage like this."

A movie isn't about the thrill. It's not about filters and fancy clothes, being spoilt as a woman and loaded as a man. No actually that actually is all this is. Netflix throws this at us because of the demands to please the audience with this sort of thing. Any pathetic, girl power, snap chat fish for likes love myself type of person will adore this. As too will any unhappy coupled or bored individual. Point blank doesn't matter how disgusting the male lead is, how bad the story or dialogue, how bad the female leads acting is, it's all about what is pleasing on the eye. That's why a Netflix original cannot be trusted or half of the reviews left by these so called adults. Many of whom are probably underage by the way or only care about a good time and no doubt have everything easy. This isn't about an escape and it's not about putting yourself in the polish girls shoes, or underpants, it's about what is wrong with the every day person these days and how so long as they're enjoying their life nothing else especially not this stuff matters. Shame. A woeful woeful film."

I was hoping that This Day would contain some of the book plot, but it didn't. In fact, This Day added things that weren't in the second novel. I can say that I was really disappointed with how Laura Beal's character was so whiny and needy. In 365DNI she was much stronger and I admired how she took over the situation of her kidnapping (Some critics compared it to Stockholm Syndrome. NOT!). Also, I hated the ending of this movie. I am waiting for the third novel and I am hoping that the writers don't take their \"artistic license\" and screw the third movie like they did the second."

        "review_detailed_main": "I find it amusing to read the reviews of American puritans expecting this film to be some sort of masterpiece of cinema. If you saw the first film you knew exactly what to expect. It is an erotic film, period! Expecting more and worse yet, reviewing it as such, is ridiculous.\n\nAs erotic films go, it is slick and visually stunning compared to its American cousins. The story is mostly predictable, yet there are surprises. The production values and the surprises set it apart from the typical erotic film. The intimate performances are pretty hot and the simulated sex scenes are convincing to any viewer.\n\nI will say as polished as it is, there are moments where the performances are a bit stiff or forced, but overall, a very well done film that could easily be appealing to couples. Exotic European locales, the dangers of mafia life, etc... set up a decent experience. For those who are looking for Shakespear, see a play, this is not for you.\n\nI enjoyed it for what it was and had no preconceived expectations to ruin the experience. I wouldn't say it was plot dense or dialogue rich, but it played to its strengths. That being the on screen chemistry between Anna Maria and Michele. It worked better than others in the same genre, where a poor story was mixed with terrible dialogue and shoe horned in simulated sex scenes between actors with little to no chemistry. If one were to remove the steamy sex scenes and panoramic vistas, it would likely be a 30 - 40 minute short about competing mafia families.\n\nI recommend checking it out if you enjoy erotic films. The staging and erotic performances are remarkable."

There were only a few comments throughout the film indicating \"something happened\" but no elaboration of what. Then almost an hour of NO PLOT whatsoever, literally just sex scenes and barely any communication. They're supposed to be in love but their behaviours towards another literally right after making \"love\" is so conflicted. Then BAM all of a sudden there's a new guy, barely any context around what's going on, and then we're near the end of the film and there's a scene that leads to several possible deaths, but the scene was SOOOO rushed that it just didn't even make sense. What the actual hell did I just waste two hours on. Sooooo angry that this was the follow up from the first film. It was so messy, really important scenes were completely rushed, and the English was so terrible. Surely they had the budget for a translator to help them with their English ffs.

The whole story has 0 flow and it's pretty much porn without showing anything too explicit. The ending was abysmal and I'm sure watching a 2 hour porn compilation would be a better way to waste the 2 hours I wasted watching this giant middle finger to the movie industry. Up until now I thought the live action Slenderman movie was the worst film I've ever seen but at least that movie was funny because of how bad it was.

Since I had seen the original, I knew I had to watch this film. It took nearly every bit of my life force to open up my Netflix app to type the movie. I wish Netflix would have crashed.\n\nWatching this movie felt like my soul was being sucked out of my body. This was one of the most miserable movie-watching experiences I have ever had. Unlike the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise or Mickey Rourke movies, this movie was just sex. There was no plot there were no characters. It was 80% sex, 10% stupidity, and 10% something resembling a story. To paraphrase a quote from Billy Madison, which looks like the Godfather compared to this garbage. \"What you've just watched is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. At no point in your rambling, incoherent viewing experience were you even close to anything that could be considered a film. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having watched it. I award you a razzie, and may God have mercy on your souls.\"\n\n0/10 A Steaming hot pile of garbage with no redeeming qualities, possibly the worst film of the decade."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I watched 365 Days...I had yet to read the books and although there were flaws, Massimo's appeal surmounted my grievances and I enjoyed the film enough to want to read the books. Now I have read book one and book two of this trilogy and am watching This Day after reading it. In this sense, I was a little disappointed that the film did not stay truer to the source material it was based on. I realize that they had to tell the story in a short period of time so it makes sense that they condensed it quite a bit and you do still get the sense that Laura is being pretty unreasonable with Massimo while he is trying to please her and do his \"job\". It really made me appreciate the loving care that Passionflix gives to its films in regards to their source material.\n\nHaving said that if I take the film just at face value...it is sexy (now there is not only the sex god Michele Morrone, but new character played by Simone Susinna), it has great luxury locations, a fabulous soundtrack and the fashion is top notch! For those reasons alone I would recommend the film.\n\nWhile I am aware that dark mafia romances are not everyone's cup of tea...for some including myself this is enjoyable escapism which is what entertainment should be. If you have \"triggers\" or only want to see women respected in a safe environment...why are you watching a dark mafia romance? No one says that it has to be your taste. If you don't like it, don't watch it. No one is being forced. Do i believe women should be kidnapped? Absolutely not. Do I want to be kidnapped? Absolutely not. But that is why it is escapism and not reality. Let people enjoy the beauty that is.\n\nMovie 2:This Day picks up jumping a little into the future with Laura back with Mossimo on the brink of their wedding. They marry and Laura quickly becomes bored after their honeymoon because Mossimo has to go to work. Laura flounces around like the pouty, spoiled brat that she is. Mossimo brings her family in for Christmas buying them gifts and Laura a fashion house to run. Then Laura sees what she thinks is Mossimo cheating on her with his ex and goes on the run with new character, \"Nacho\" the new gardener. She spends time learning to surf in a tropical island paradise with Nacho...and if you want any more you will have to watch the film.\n\nWhile not for everyone...I know plenty of people that I will be recommending this film to and I for one cannot wait for the conclusion of this story."

For those who have done 50 shades of gray, learn something from this one because they eat you for breakfast with that pathetic excuse for the movie. You need to know what key market segment expects from you. Given that this film is based on one of the less popular trilogies, I hope someone will soon catch up with really popular writers like J. R.

As bad as the first one was, there was a little bit of something going on, and there's perhaps even more sex here, which may be fine with some people, but the thing is, for the first half or so of the film, there's a sex scene every now and then. You're kind of watching sex all the time until about the second half of the movie, where it slows down a little bit with those scenes and a little bit of story comes in, which I think is just as weak. So what does this film have to offer? The first half is all sex, which we can find everywhere on unnamed sites these days, and the second half has some plot, but it's not the best. This film will probably please only the biggest fans of the first part. I would advise others to avoid this one. It has nothing to offer in my opinion. Unless you want a good dose of eroticism without a deeper plot. Otherwise, I don't know. For me, a bad film that I don't recommend."

There are 35 pop songs played throughout the movie and the movie is 111 minutes long, that's roughly a pop song every three minutes. The songs don't hide the lack of story and they definitely don't hide the quality of the movie. It's not even good music it's as generic as possible.

I have not read the books, I don't know if the dialogues are as corny as they are in this film. But jesus christ, everything that came out of the actors' mouths were like sharp nails on a chalkboard. But beyond the arguably worst dialogue in the history of professionally produced filmmaking, the whole thing looks like a collage of rap music videos, something like how \"new money\" people would imagine being rich looks like. Scenes don't add to a story. They are just there to fill the time.\n\nOtherwise, it's clearly not amateur camera work. Actors, are not even particularly bad. The lead guy can give face and emotions. People who performed miles worse in previous jobs ended up wining Oscars in their subsequent works in the past.\n\nBut the script... I have seen nothing like it. There is clearly something wrong at Netflix, if they can't turn down this script, ask the writers to \"kindly revise\"."

While the two leads are on fire with their chemistry, scene after scene after scene of Sox and more Sox gets really boring. Another thing that bugged me is how much of a beech Laura was. Snapping at Massimo for arranging a nice weekend away for you with your best friend? Telling Massimo at a party, in front of family and business associates, that you are done and demand to leave? He's a proud Italian mafioso. Very disrespectful to speak to him like that and also unwise. I've watched the first one easily 365 times, ha. See what I did there? But I've hardly watched this one.

Long ago, I was able to see all of the films featured in Harry Medved's brilliant book \"The 50 Worst Movies of All Time\"...and have gone on to complete or nearly complete a few other bad film lists. Apparently I am a glutton for punishment...and I'm adding \"365 Days: This Day\" to this infamous quest. Yes, I watched it because the film is supposed to be terrible...and right now it's on IMDB's Bottom 100 List...with an overall score a measly 2.5....placing it at #60. Interestingly, the film it's a sequel to, \"365 Days\", is also on IMDB's list...though with a score that's recently risen to 3.3, it's apparently better...but I really, really hated \"365 Days\"! It's not hard to guess what I will think of the sequel!\n\nThis film is Polish...the first Polish 'bad film' I've seen. And, for some reason, Netflix has chosen to buy it and market it here in the States...and subscribers apparently are not enchanted with the story!\n\nThe first film had a very sick premise....a mobster kidneaps a woman and he expects her to eventually fall in love with him. And, amazingly, she does...which sends so many inappropriate and weird messages to men and women! Here in the sequel, it begins with the same pair of weirdo lovers tying the knot...but, not surprisingly, problems are on the horizon.\n\nLike the previous film, this one plays much like a porno film where they edited out much of the nudity. Now I am NOT saying it's a PG-13 or R film...so it's still amazingly explicit...especially for Netflix. So what the film emphasizes is a dopey plot more than nudity...which I am sure is the reason most folks watch porn anyway...those great and realistic plots.\n\nSo is it any good? Of course not. While the film looks nice and was filmed in many lovely locations, the story is pretty dumb. Plus, WHO wants to be rooting for a mobster and his kinky new wife?! That's a pretty hard sell!\n\nThat being said, while the film is offensive (again, the wife was kidnapped and made a sex slave....eventually a very willing and frisky one!) and dumb, I don't think it's among the 100 worst films ever made...nor close to it. Technically speaking, at times the film appears to be well made despite the many deficiencies of the writing and silly acting and plot."

He wasn't in it! That's my point he made a wise choice! I'm angry that I am actually writing a negative review because I feel I'm cheating on Massimo BUT come on this was bad like really bad! There was no acting, no story line, no talking or anything for the first hour perhaps???? It was tacky! And a waste of beautiful looking actors, scenery, properties and cars it just wasn't a film! I think the writer just got lucky with good looking actors, it was an extended model photo shoot end of there was just nothing, nothing! I'm annoyed like really annoyed. A honeymoon whereby they didn't talk just a few outfit changes and a few 15 second clips, no actual relationship just sex! And then when I finally heard some speaking I checked and only had 15 minutes of the film left! I thought there was a mistake on my Netflix account I was about to log out and sign back in or cancel the whole subscription! I hate knocking people down but the writer failed massively!!!!! I still want my own Massimo though ......... wishful thinking but yeah I'm sad after watching that, I felt like I needed to look over my shoulder and see if anyone actually saw me watching it because it was so bad!"

The sequel, however, had me feeling like I did as a kid in the '80's and into the '90's when sequels as a rule, with a few notable exceptions, were consistently inferior films.\n\nAnd this was a god-awful meets dumpster fire in ways previously unexplored. I mean, at least they stopped after crap sequels like \"Jewel Of the Nile,\" or \"Weekend At Bernie's II,\" but these guys are likely going to go on to \"Crocodile Dundee in LA,\" or even \"Robocop 3\" infamy.\n\nI'm giving this 2 stars because I did enjoy the soundtrack as much as the first and because, as many have referred to this as a \"guilty pleasure,\" I'll likely succumb to curiosity and watch dumpster fire part III like Cersei walking through Kings' Landing ...

I had reviewed the first part as well and so, here we go with my take on the latest one.\n\nFirst the plot : Don Massimo (Michele Morrone) and Laura ( Anna-Maria Sieklucka) get wedded and go for their honeymoon to continue what they did all through the first part. After all kinds of kinky sex, Laura discovers that Massimo is cheating on her and runs away with her gardener (Simone Sussina) whom she develops a crush on...\n\nTo be fair, This Day has a semblance of a plot unlike the original which was just an apology to portray continuous love making scenes. Here, the prime characters like Laura are developed a wee bit even as the sex scenes keep popping up frequently either in reality or a wet dream!! The climax is again kept open ended hinting at a further sequel which I believe is in the making..\n\nOf the cast, Anna-Maria shows improvement from before but the same can't be said for her co-actor Michele. Overall, 365 Days : This Day can be tried by those who have seen the first part though it is not something I would wholeheartedly recommend.\n\nStrictly adults viewing please!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

I mean it's no secret that they're heavily in debt. I'm guessing using expensive sets and expensive cars won't exactly be a great idea for them... especially when funding such a ridiculous project.

(The filming style, locations of filming, etc.) There also isn't a lot of dialogue which is frustrating, IF you would like to follow along. A lot of these reviews are over exaggerated. I can name 5 films off the top of my head that are WAY worse ( Superbabies 2, anyone?) Anyway, if ur looking for hot people with minimal clothing or background noise, dont overcomplicate things.

However, I'd be lying if I said I disliked it as much as the 2020 original. It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!\n\nUnlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else!\n\nThere's even some minor neat cinematography, too. The positives I note are minimal, though, and don't overly help this 2022 production. I have more negatives, which also include an overlong run time and that shoddy ending. At least it marginally improves upon the film it follows, I wonder if its own sequel will do likewise? I plan to find out!"

All actors are good looking and the sex scenes are very realistic. Although the overall acting is not the highlight of this film, the sex scenes are always on point. If someone told me that the actors really had sex there, I would totally buy it."

The erotic scenes were captured without po*n like stamps, but with true romantic atmosphere and not standard style of cameraman. If you like that oversaturated, fictional, idealized genre - just watch and relax."

        "review_detailed_main": "My initial thought after watching this film was: \"This was directed primarily by a woman.\" It was so much better than the first ! Why this one has the lowest ratings is beyond my comprehension. The \"music video\" cinematography is perhaps the weakest aspect. There was probably only a page of dialogue for all characters combined, lol. However, the film almost completely rids of the male gaze and toxic masculinity undertones. You can tell this film was primarily directed by a woman. The camera shots on Laura's pleasure were clear. It focuses on her experience, not Massimo's. There wasn't a single BJ scene ! Also, it shows a bit more chemistry between Laura and Massimo. She is laughing and smiling with him. We even get a small, but significant smile from Massimo. Additionally, it shows Laura and her friend Olga having fun at fancy restaurants and clubs ! This is good ! The writers finally realised that women like buildup and emotional intimacy.\n\nNacho brings some more conflict and plot to the film. However, he's not a bad guy at all. He is more emotional than Massimo. Which is why I am #TeamNacho. His name may be ridiculous, but he is gentle and compassionate, unlike Massimo.\n\nBesides the excessive use of music and the cheesy film archetypes (love triangle, evil twin, etc.), this film was decent. I was not uncomfortable in any of the scenes. My rating was 5/10 because it is not a quality film in a general sense. You cannot take it seriously. It was entertaining, not rape-y, and showed more emotional buildup than its unfortunate predecessor."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I'm here because I watched the first film. It wasn't great, but it had its plus points - a bit of sexual tension, some pretty hot scenes and a bit of a storyline. But I think the writers and producers of this follow-on made the mistake of thinking the only reason people watched the first (and hence the second) was for sex. Newsflash - we're in 2022, we can get soft (or hard) porn any day of the week. If we're watching a film, we also expect a bit of a storyline to go with it.\n\nThis film is so full of (bad) soundtracks and (cliched) montages, it looks like a naff 80s pop video. I think there are about 4 songs in the first 17 minutes of this film alone. It's sex for the sake of sex, and because all the plotline and tension has been lost, it's about as erotic as watching two gibbons mate at Whipsnade. Also, the way those two kiss is quite disgusting - the face-licking and open-mouthed salivating. The two main actors actually become incredibly unattractive.\n\nThe 'plot', for what its worth (when it gets going) doesn't really mean much. The acting is either wooden or OTT (the 'baddies' are like parodies of baddies). And let's not even start on how bad the English language parts are. Now I know that, in real life, non native speakers of English will muddle tenses etc, and that's charming and perfectly acceptable. But in a film, it's grating to hear someone say, for example, 'You've got to take responsibility of your own life' rather than for your own life. Maybe this scripting was intentional. But it just feels amateur when, in reality, many people who speak English as a second language can do so fluently. It was just one more thing, on top of the lousy acting, that's going to jar with an audience, as it makes the scriptwriting values look as shoddy as the rest of it.\n\nAll in all, I'd say to give this film a miss, even if you liked/loved the first one. If you watch it, you WILL be disappointed."

Loved the visuals and the scenery. Also loved the music. The erotic scenes that most of us loved in the first movie were cramped in the first 30 minutes and it was lacking afterwards."

There are entire scenes that could very well not be in the movie and the plot and scheme of the movie would not change one bit!!\n\nOne scene has a main character say at the end \"I have an idea!\" very emphatically. The next scene is a sex fest, and the movie continues without ever hearing about or seeing what that idea was. It's horribly terrible, the acting is pretty bad, Massimo looks like he's having an aneurism in almost every scene he's in, and the only reason it's getting watched is because of the first one, which was actually fairly decent.\n\nYou don't watch a movie like this for the plot, just like you don't watch Deepthroat for the acting. It's a porno. Don't get me wrong, the girl looks great, but it's a porno."

And yes, the genre is totally unclear - is it an erotic movie? There are some scenes - but they never reach a real appeal - not in length, not in intensity, not even in nudity. Is it a thriller? Nope again - the story has a twist - which is rather lame. Even there is no mentionable character development. The protagonists are doing their mistakes again and again (even though \"she claims\" to learn out of her prior mistakes).\n\nMaybe it is advertisement? Regrettable even the featured products (for example a beautiful Bugatti Chiron) are cut short. You could not even use the movie to use as screensaver (e.g. In an electronic store) - the few sex scenes are not really adequate for this use.\n\nInstead this movie is dipping its toes into different genres but unfortunately never commits.\n\nWell - maybe it is a dating movie - not intense enough to be a direct sign, but not interesting enough - so it gives plenty time of another focus. But then it showcases that you have got really bad taste when it comes to movies. Also not ideal."

I criticized the first movie based on the sick state of the culture of male-female relationships. There are many other things that can be criticized in the script, but they are very insignificant compared to this aspect of the series. The most obvious one is the shoddy plot twist on which the scenario is based. It was needed so that the porn-like aspect of the film would not repeat itself and could be developed further. Another aspect of the movie that bothered me immensely: Claiming to portray a strong female character while destroying the hard-earned dignity of the female figure and making her shallow."

I can't believe I'm saying this but, at least the first movie had the plot of him trying to get the girl to fall for him. But, now that has happened what's the point?! Why are we still watching these two characters who I wasn't even rooting for in the first place just laying around being some of the most unlikable characters I have seen in awhile. It's not like the screenwriters thought to write a story that has us follow these characters through a relatable emotional journey like The Before Trilogy did no, its just music video after music video and maybe 15 minutes in total of plot comes up mostly at the end of the movie. And spoiler alert I still don't like them after this movie. If anything I dislike them even more cause they somehow act even dumber and more insane. The movie if you want to call it that does not earn its over hour and forty minute run time. It felt like an eternity watching this. This movie isn't even so bad it's good kind of like the first one, it's so boring you could you use this movie to torture someone if you ever get so mad at them you want them to suffer."
