On top of that I don't expect a whole lot from Netflix movies, so I went in with very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe film is intriguing, it works on the drama and mystery level, and though I'm not easily scared, I would say that the few horror elements in the film are pretty well done. The acting is solid all around, and the direction is capable.\n\nThe thing is, and I'm guessing this is due to the fact that it's based on a book, the film tries to do too much. There are characters (Willis) and plot lines (Catherine's bulimia) that you imagine are important in the book, but fail to make the kind of impact on the film that they were clearly meant to. It's hard to go into detail without spoiling, but in short more emphasis on characters and main plot lines would have served the movie well. I have no doubt the source material is fantastic, but the movie could have done better if some of it had just been left in the book.\n\nWhich brings us to the two hour run-time, some would argue that it would have been better if it was shorter, I would argue the that the length is what makes the film (mostly) work in the end.\n\nTo sum up, a decent supernatural thriller, albeit with a bit too much going on."

But I will say, if you're wanting a horror film, or a film that satisfies on a visceral level, or a film that \"makes sense\" so you don't have to think too much, by all means, move on to something else, But if you are in the mood for a well-acted, literary, poetic rendering of a classic morality tale seen through the lens of Victorian spiritualism and Swedenborg's mysticism, watch and enjoy."

The real life characters are interesting and have more than enough depth to carry the story by themselves. The things that they do are interesting, not what's happening to them. I assume it came from a place of wanting to sell the story as a horror movie, but even then the film is very rarely scary.\n\nThe film is long for the genre coming in slightly over 2 hours. This can be a risk because if your film isn't good then it can feel extremely long and tedious to watch. Luckily 'Things Heard & Seen' is strong enough to justify it and what's more the extra length let's the story develop at a more natural pace. The film isn't afraid to get very dark at times either. There is one particularly brutal scene near the end that I wasn't expecting (even though it was cleverly foreshadowed).\n\nIf you like a ghost story then there is probably enough of that going on here to keep you interested. If you don't like ghost stories then don't be too put off by that being present here. There's more than enough other stuff going on that you can pretty much just ignore that element and enjoy the rest like I did. I had a good time with 'Things Heard & Seen' and would say it is worth your time."

Everyone saying this movie builds slowly and leads to nothing... yeah, I disagree. I think most people just don't have much of an attention span these days, (sometimes myself included), and it's easy to check out of something quickly. But I felt like there were no loose ends in this film, and everything concluded well for me. It held my attention the entire time. I will say that if you are looking for a horror movie, this probably isn't it. More of a drama/suspense, but very well executed. If you're into true crime, I think you'll find it interesting.

The direction which was made by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini was very good and they succeeded on creating the feelings of both mystery and fear, something that made us relate to their main characters. The interpretations of Amanda Seyfried who played as Catherine Claire, James Norton who played as George Claire and F. Murray Abraham who played as Floyd DeBeers were very good and their combination worked very well.

        "review_title": "A very earnest and strong film that could've been a new masterpiece",
        "review_detailed_main": "I think the best thing I can say about this movie is that it's earnest. The cast gives great, believable performances all around and there isn't a weak link among them. Norton as George Claire is great as a character you'll love to hate. Seyfried isn't given as much to do as you may like but she sells her scenes very capably. Apart from the actors, the movie is often quite nice to look at as well, with plenty of high shots to soak in the beautiful landscape and set the scene.\n\nI'm trying to puzzle the very mediocre reviews the movie received and I can only imagine it's due to the overall lack of scares and somewhat busy plot. If you're expecting a film with 1/3 story, 1/3 action and 1/3 jump scares, you're going to be very disappointed. The scares are few and far between. Similar to The Haunting of Hill House, this movie is equal parts about haunted people as it is about an actual haunting. The character drama is fairly strong, with believable motivations and distress.\n\nHowever, the film's one major flaw that I can agree with others on is the uneven nature of its many plot points. There's a lot going on in the movie's run time. It balances all the plot points in a watchable fashion, but it does throw off the pacing sometimes because you, as the audience, can't quite get a hold on which plots are really gonna pay off and which are just feeding the larger narrative. It's kind of hard to explain, but this probably would've worked better as a limited series than a two hour movie.\n\nAll in all, Things Heard and Seen is eminently watchable and a far better movie than the 5.3 you're seeing at the time of this review's writing would lead you to believe. Just don't put it on hoping for lots of jump scares or spooky nuns jumping out of closets, it's not that kind of movie."

You really get into the movie and its characters and maybe learn things about them, that make them not as likeable (some of them).

What I personally liked, was seeing the aftermath of a horrible act and not the horrible act itself - though horrible may be a definition thing for some - what do you consider horrible or just plain morally wrong? Maybe you even think it is justified ... although that would make me question your morals on more than one occasion.\n\nAs at least another reviewer said though, the ending is quite ... weak. Which is the last impression you have of a movie. What was not disclosed and what I can't tell you either at the moment is at what moment (time wise) you should turn off and make up the rest on your own. I just know that the movie seems to pander to both sides - trying to shock but also appease. It may look good, but you may have issues to totally understand certain things ... especially an out there decision being made by one of the main characters ... way out there, but still in frame! (puns very much intended) - but you may feel different about it of course and think this is the best solution to this ever. Though why the awake(ning) then? Well you can't win them all, now can you?

Be aware it's a slow burn that doesn't end neatly or typically. But it's well worth it.\n\nThis film has got ghosts but the real horror lies in the inter generational violence towards women. The real fright is in men's attitude to their 'belongings' and what they feel entitled to take or break.\n\nYou can feel the knot in your stomach as the film goes on and you realise it's not about the ghosts but about who she realises she's living with. Also, well played by both lead actors."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\n\nHorror is definitely one of my favorite genres. I find this type of film extremely impactful when done right. From sleepless nights to unforgettable images, I can never get enough of horror. However, just like every other popular genre, it reached a point where studios care more about building franchises set on formulaic screenplays than actually delivering original, creative, unique stories. Netflix isn't known for exceptional horror content, so I was skeptical going into this movie.\n\nThings Heard & Seen may hold a generic premise, but Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini are able to add enough substance to make it interesting. Amanda Seyfried (Mank) and James Norton (Little Women) offer two remarkable performances, portraying two distinct characters that somehow ended up together. Both have their own flaws, but the husband is depicted in such a negative manner that it becomes challenging to follow someone so despicable. The main narrative offers a slight twist on the usual ghost story, making it more than just a creepy jumpscare festival, as well as possessing a particularly violent scene that's no short of surprising.\n\nDespite the suspenseful atmosphere, the slow pacing drags an overlong film that unfortunately features an underwhelming ending. The beginning of the third act reaches the peak of excitement, boasting attention-grabbing character decisions that will surely raise the entertainment value. Sadly, the mix of feminist themes with the supernatural narrative is far from getting the right balance, ending as yet another horror flick that had everything to be much, much better.\n\nRating: B-"

And it's supposed to have Natalie Dyer as one of the leads, but she's there like 20 minutes. Which I don't really mind, because Amanda Seyfried brought me here. Too bad her character's so annoying... They had this opportunity to make things differently for once, but on top of copying everything from The Exorcist to Amityville, The Shining, and What Lies Beneath. They couldn't help but shove these cringeworthy agendas, without it being relevant to the story. The acting is ok at least. But that ending... Did they really think it was good?!

One more thing that intrigues the audience is the unique performance that every actor has delivered. It makes you feel wholesome from time to time. The story seems quite interesting at first but with time as the film goes on it gets kind of boring right in the second arc. At the start of the third arc, it feels like that the movie shouldn't have been this long and in the end. This movie ends in a twisted way that definitely doesn't intrigue anything. Plot-wise this movie has some predecessors and compared to them the director tried to create something unique with this movie but overall it fell on the ground from way high. The screenplay could have been good if the story stayed strong to the roots until the end. In terms of watching it's not quite a film that someone will try to recommend to others and it also falls into the one-time watch club overall."

The script totally ruins all the good that can come out, messy and incoherent at times. It integrates characters into the plot with a potential in the film that, in addition to not using them, they forget and lose their meaning, for example: Natalia Dyer and Alex Neustaedter. The spirits or paranormal activity that appear in the house is not clear why and the relationship that they establish so directly with the main ones at the end.\n\nBoth James Norton and Amanda Seyfried did what they could, the first one tried to take the evolution of his character as natural as he could but the notoriously incoherent script did not help him and Seyfried the same, a great actress but she could not do much more.\n\nAs a film that promised to be a more poetic or psychological terror, it had a long way to go and delve into states in the characters and scenes, none of them were scary or understood why it would have to be generated."

This story is much more restrained and is all the better for it. Whilst the supernatural is present, it doesn't take centre stage and acts as a metaphor for people being haunted by secrets and lies. It's certainly not the dead we need to fear in Things Heard and Seen. It's certainly not going to be to everyone's taste. The pacing is slower than in a lot of films, but this only builds the tension that such a story demands. It's a story that doesn't need to be pigeonholed.

Drama? Mby, husband was posseded with evil spirit? Horror? There was like 1% horror moments. Mistery? There was none. And the ending was the worst. First half of the movie was decent and i had feeling this will be good, but other half was just very bad. Acting was good, production value is good, but the script its awful, especcially the ending . Max 5 starts just because of a charming actress. Without good lead actress this movie would be 3 starts for me."

And more so, what was up with the ending. It felt abrupt and it came from nowhere. I'm not talking about the artwork of the book that established the connection, but rather the decisions that brought George Claire into that situation.\n\nI'd enjoy a rather darker ending with the film being 25-30 minutes shorter.\n\nIn its current state, it is okay but leaves you asking what was the point of all that quality writing and acting."

        "review_detailed_main": "Horror is definitely one of my favorite genres. I find this type of film extremely impactful when done right. From sleepless nights to unforgettable images, I can never get enough of horror. However, just like every other popular genre, it reached a point where studios care more about building franchises set on formulaic screenplays than actually delivering original, creative, unique stories. Netflix isn't known for exceptional horror content, so I was skeptical going into this movie.\n\nThings Heard & Seen may hold a generic premise, but Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini are able to add enough substance to make it interesting. Amanda Seyfried (Mank) and James Norton (Little Women) offer two remarkable performances, portraying two distinct characters that somehow ended up together. Both have their own flaws, but the husband is depicted in such a negative manner that it becomes challenging to follow someone so despicable. The main narrative offers a slight twist on the usual ghost story, making it more than just a creepy jumpscare festival, as well as possessing a particularly violent scene that's no short of surprising.\n\nDespite the suspenseful atmosphere, the slow pacing drags an overlong film that unfortunately features an underwhelming ending. The beginning of the third act reaches the peak of excitement, boasting attention-grabbing character decisions that will surely raise the entertainment value. Sadly, the mix of feminist themes with the supernatural narrative is far from getting the right balance, ending as yet another horror flick that had everything to be much, much better."

It did pretty well on the mystery factor and keeping you guessing enough to not immediately reveal all the plot points without being boring.\n\nA lot of people didn't like the ending, but I thought that it fit well for the themes addressed. The story makes sense and has a conclusion that's appropriate to the story and the build-up made. The real horror resides with the living. I think the biggest reason people were let down by this movie was because they were expecting classic horror with its evil ghosts and loud jumpscares. Instead, we have a quiet movie, leaving room for the audience to be a little more emotionally involved than is typical with horror. I find it more psychological than scary, and it's meant to be like that, so it benefits from not trying to be typical horror."

Swedenborg and his teachings feature in the film, and the area where it's set was a seedbed for his followers. The house itself is soon a hotbed of poltergeist and other ghostly activities. Even a seance is held there. Seyfried discovers that the house has a sinister past and her husband is also hiding secrets. Mostly psychological horror but there are several murders and attempted murders including an ax attack. A Gothic haunted house thriller which is overlong at 121 minutes., it might have worked better with 20 minutes shaved off it's running time. Still worth watching though. Written & Directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pucini. On Netflix. 6/10."

Its got enough character development and strange things going on to get you interested.\n\nThen it drops to 3 stars when it starts take a turn where it feels like a poor-mans version of the Shining. What was interesting before now starts to feel empty and some stuff turns downright goofy (the seance).\n\nThen drops to 1 star when it comes to the ending/last 20 minutes. This film nosedives right off a cliff into an abyss of stupidity that will leave you confused and disappointed. It was just so horribly done.\n\nRidiculous looking ghosts. The editing is really, really bad. Looks like it was cut together at high school amateur hour. The acting was solid up until the end. All actors, including Amanda, just cranked the acting dial up way too hard at the end.\n\nNetflix is on a roll for consecutively serving up some of the worse films I have seen in a long time. First Stowaway and now this dumpster fire. Thinking of canceling so I don't get served up these turds and wasting hours of my life."

I did enjoy the acting for the most part I think the writer wanted to combine two many things and it made it a bit confusing. Don't have high expectations just watch it for entertainment reasons."

Some apparently are, but the first off eerie presence in the house soon gave me a sensation of calm, like being watched over by something good. The movie takes a spin for the weirder of directions, I'll admit, but I found it original, artistic and even soothing in a way. Worth your time I'd say."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ok, so I'm not a fan of Netflix movies. Overall I find they contain ideas in them aren't fully fleshed out and are derivative. The writing lacks punch and originality, the stories are predictable, and the visuals rely heavy on the current fashionable trend of lense flares and colour palettes of turquoise and orange. Add in plenty of (overly corrected) political correctness or woke-ness, an over-sexualisation of teenagers and some unnecessary sexual relationships that add nothing to the plot, men that are abusive, or selfish and act oppressively to all women in the film. These are just some of the ideas that are squeezed in you're usual Netflix movie... If you're not sure about this, or disagree then watch their movies and observe who the villian is, or what ideas they consistently demonise and you'll get the idea.\n\nThis movie has nearly all of these tropes, though in a less obvious way in some cases (which is good) nonetheless, and like most Netflix movies, the shoehorning of so many themes gets in the way of how clearly the story is told and experienced. And that is the reason for the low score- the movie is muddled in terms of what it is saying. It's not original in any way either, apart from the artwork (which I really enjoyed btw). There is a spiritual aspect to the story, but I suppose this is Netflix's way of replacing Western Christian exposition with something they believe is more suitable!!?? I haven't read the book so don't know.\n\nWould I recommend it? Not really as Ive seen much better films of this type. But I wouldn't recommend many Netflix films either! ;-)"

I choose new movies to watch to give the actors and writers a fair chance to entertain BUT what I don't appreciate (after watching this film) are the news articles that hype it up.

The story is being laid out slowly and takes you on a journey through time, spiritual connections and art. The twists are surprising, but very subtle - I know it sounds weird, but this is part of why the movie is so amazing. Even though it is set in the late 70ies/early 80ies, it bears a message so true to many real stories, now and in the past.

This very quick review is based off a film viewer only as I believe any film should be entertaining regardless of the adaptation.\n\nIf you want a really quick review here you go. In one word. BORING.\n\nIt takes a solid hour for something to happen and even after that not a whole lot goes down. This film relied on the audience suspense to keep it going, but the plot felt so flat that there just wasn't any. There was no obvious direction for the plot to go in either, so it's not like you are eagerly waiting for the end either! It needed so much more for it to be an entertaining film.\n\nThe ending? Awful to be blunt. Now I googled the ending and its just ridiculous. Ends to illustrate various metaphors about good and evil and because of some book that's briefly mentioned at the beginning. Like behave, who in the right mind is going to understand any of that. Any ending that you have to google is a huge no from me!\n\nBeyond that I found the side characters to be so pointless and futile to the main story. They were all so soulless. The plot feels like it's leading us to a few of them being part of this long story, but no. They just vanish away.\n\nThe film is listed as a horror on Netflix. It's absolutely not, there's not an ounce of horror in here so if you intend to watch based off it being listed as that then please don't.\n\nThe only reason I gave this a 3/10 and not a 1 is simply because I found that the male main character to be a really complex guy and it was interesting to see his development as the film progressed. But, that's about it sadly in terms of whats good.\n\nSo yeah, would I recommend? If I really disliked who I'm recommending to then yeah sure. But in all seriousness, it's just a really dull film that doesn't really serve much to you. 3/10."

This movie actually reminded me of Crimson Peak insomuch as it's not a ghost story, it's just a story with ghosts in it. The real horror of this movie surrounds a struggling woman who's married to a narcissist, who will do anything to get what he thinks he deserves. I can't really detail that more without giving spoilers, but I will say that there are some classic signs of an abusive relationship throughout the film and the way it ties together with the supernatural elements was very satisfying for me. I also really liked the Swedenborg allusions, and the way they carried throughout the film. Most of what I've seen about unfinished plot points is only partially fair, imo everything that happens ties back in to the central plot of the movie, even if some things don't have clear consequences. And as most of the reviews so far have mentioned, the acting was quite good.\n\nI will also say that I am a big fan of spiritualism & somewhat niche religious beliefs, love the scenery of upstate New York, and have some experience with domestic violence, all of which surely contributed to my enjoyment of this film, which is why the title of this review says \"for specific tastes\". If none of the above things apply to you, especially the last one, this film might not be as impactful for you."

It really skims the plot in an unsatisfying way, I wish it would give a bit more depth instead of absolutely everything needing to be assumed.\n\nWhen I saw the trailer and even the first 20 or so minutes of the film I was like Amityville Horror! I mean come on, their names are George and Cathrine and they're moving to up state New York.\n\nI didn't dislike the film at all, I think it was beautiful to look at, and the acting was clean and well done."

So without giving any spoilers, I really recommend watching this movie if you like thrillers with hints of the spiritual/ghost-world. But please don't go in thinking it's a very scary horror movie, it is NOT! It's an interesting story with a different take on haunted houses/spirits lingering after death. I gave it 10 stars to compensate the low rating but I truly think this movie is underrated and should be seen in a different light."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is basically a decent, atmospheric thriller, but for some reason they thought of turning it into a (mild) horror-flick, by spicing it up with supernatural elements. In my opinion the story itself is involving enough as it is, without the spirits and vague apparitions, that weren't very convincing to begin with, and definitely were not in the least bit scary.\n\nThe main story of a vulnerable young mother and her seemingly civilized husband, who in fact is a fraud and a cheater and goes even beyond that to try and save his skin, is pretty solid and keeps you on the edge of your chair, watching the guy relentlessly stooping from bad to (far!) worse. The movie has a weird surprise in store by way of the last totally unexpected killing, and then the ultimate fate of the villain. Did they really see that as justice being served?! To me it made for a rather unsatisfying ending.\n\nThe acting of especially Amanda Seifried is great, and F. Murray Abraham acts as easy and confident as ever in his small part. I wasn't that pleased with James Norton, his looks and attitude didn't seem to match with the aura of an arrogant and philandering con-man that he was supposed to play. But of course that could have been precisely what the makers aimed for."

By not focusing on the haunting element, it manages to skirt past many of the genres worst clich\u00e9s. There's a \"you-go-girl\" feminism in watching Amanda Seyfried wake up to the subtle manipulation at the core of her toxic relationship.

Only the little girl could have been replaced by a dummy, because other than \"Mommy, I'm scared!\" there's not much contribution from her.\n\nThe sets are great for a period piece, the score fits perfectly and the whole film looks pretty good.\n\nIn terms of horror movies it sure lacks the scary part, but in comparison to all the other wannabe goosebumps-flicks it's on the winning side.\n\nCould be worse."

        "review_detailed_main": "Summary:\n\nFirst of all, let's clarify that we are not looking at a traditional horror movie but a conjugal drama with fantastic elements that takes place mostly, yes, in what we could call a haunted house. That is why it unleashes the ire of viewers and certain critics who lose their position in the face of a combination of genres or a different approach to them or of those who confuse their intentions with those of those who made the film. In short, they cannot read where the terrifying sits, they do not recognize it.\n\nDeveloped with a good narrative pulse, is a production that despite its length maintains interest, is filmed with a beautiful photograph and that, consistent with its premise and style, fortunately avoids the gratuitous underlines of so many traditional horror films.\n\nReview:\n\nGeorge Claire (James Norton, seen in Happy Valley and The Nevers) is an art history professor who gets a recommendation to practice at a small university in upstate New York. His wife Catherine (Amanda Seyfried, whom we recently saw in First Reformed) is a restorer who agrees to accompany him to his new destination with their young daughter. The family settles in an old house with a dark past where disturbing phenomena soon begin to manifest themselves.\n\nFirst of all, let's clarify that we are not looking at a traditional horror movie but a conjugal drama with fantastic elements that takes place mostly, yes, in what we could call a haunted house. That is why it unleashes the ire of viewers or certain critics who lose their position in the face of a combination of genres or a different approach to them or those who confuse their intentions with those of those who made the film.\n\nActually, it is a film similar to The Nest: the new house sets in motion a marital crisis that was latent because it unmasks the personality of her husband. In The Appearance of Things, the film rightly accompanies the point of view of both members of the couple and describes how, in some way, the house \"accompanies\" this crisis. And as for her approach to the genre, she follows the line of Babadook or Hereditary in terms of privileging drama.\n\nIn much of the film of Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini a couple drama dominates where the divergent paths that both spouses begin to travel and the incidence of some secondary characters in it are developed with a calm but without pause. The fantastic backdrop relates to the ideas of the afterlife of the 18th century Swedish theologian Swedenborg and to the object of study of George, the 19th century painter George Innes, a follower of Swedenborg and one of whose works illustrates the cover of one of his books. But the introduction of the film had already warned us that something serious happened in the house and the film enters a later stage of its development into the terrain of the thriller, as a logical culmination of the accumulated tensions (although one regrets the breakdown of the calm narrative balance of the first part).\n\nSeyfried and Norton are perfect in their roles, as well as Rhea Seehorn as Catherine's new friend, in a production that despite its length maintains interest and is filmed with a beautiful photograph, which fortunately avoids the underlining of so many horror films and whose key question would be where does the terrifying lie? It seems that many viewers are unable to see it."

I'm sure it makes her more relatable to certain audience and even more realistic a person, as a lot of her characteristics are the result of an unhappy relationship, but it doesn't really drive the story on its own.\n\nOnce the momentum of the story, the house, and the characters start to build, the movie really becomes something else.

As others have mentioned, there are numerous plot holes or red herrings (depending on your bent) which should have been omitted from the film. Their inclusion doesn't create a Sixth Sense denouement; rather, they just clutter up the plot. There also seems to little understanding of how to adapt a psychological novel into a compelling and succinct film. As such, nothing--not even the main characters--is fully developed. This movie had so much potential which could have been reached if it had been better executed. Instead, it felt like I watched a rough first draft of the book."

Easiest way to kill it is to just give in.\"\n\nA Manhattan artist relocates her young family to a historic hamlet in the Hudson Valley. As she settles into a new life, she begins to suspect that her marriage has a sinister darkness, one that rivals her new home's history. Things Heard and Seen didn't have much of a chance from the very details we were given. The most that it could get was being an ok movie. To my surprise it actually made it to that mark. However, this is one that will be forgotten quickly. Actually, I don't think it's even in the top viewed on Netflix only a short time after. The story is ok. It never goes anywhere exciting and new. Everything plays out as expected. The biggest weakness comes from the runtime. At just 2 hours long, it's such a drag. There is no reason for it to be as long as it is. But for some reason, we have a prolonged slow-burn that lacked excitement. I feel like the ending is supposed to be shocking or something big at least, however, I found it to be quite a waste. Maybe it's because of how everything is setup. Nevertheless, it's just kind of there.\n\nFor a ghost story, this feels more like a drama surrounding a marriage. That part, I did find some interest. There's many issues within the marriage of Catherine and George that it's hard not to get the least bit interested. Amanda Seyfried carried this movie. She is good in it and tries her best to keep it all together. Last year she got stuck with another disappointing horror movie called You Should Have Left. We know she can act and her time is finally shining through with her recent Oscar nomination earlier this year. Most of the acting is good, in fact. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to give it the flare needed. I can see where the movie wanted to go, and it does setup well in the beginning. Things Heard and Seen tries to hard to divert itself away from the typical horror-drama, but in its attempts it can't make its way out of something just average."

There are a few tense moments. But overall the plot is pretty formulaic and predictable, even lazy in places.\n\nThere are elements of Amityville to this, but time isnt really spent properly developing the mental decline of the main antagonist. Plus he's so \"bad\" that its often laughable - and that brings me to my final point - this is a horror made to honor the \"me too\" movement, its very feminine-power heavy. That works OK up to a point - but just watch it with that in mind.\n\nJames Norton does OK as a creep, but he's not a very convincing killer. Overall, its not bad and worth a watch with low expectations. I guess thats why its on Netflix after all...."

It feels like a first time try in the genre and it feels very average. Nothing is well supported or justified.\n\nWhich is odd an normally horror films tend to be filmed in few locations, giving you a lot of control for you to play with and come up with clever approaches.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film made its way to Netflix today and I managed to find two hours spare so I watched it and here is my review for Things Heard and Seen. The premise of the film sees a couple move to The Hudson Valley where things start to unravel and there might even be supernatural forces in play.\n\nMain Character Amanda Seyfried and James Norton plays the two leads here and they both do okay jobs. Neither of their characters are particularly interesting but they are clearly two talented performers and they try to make the most out of what they have and that is some pretty good qualities. But you won't care about either of these two characters or there plights as it is just really dull and mundane with very little reason given as to really why these characters are in this situation.\n\nSupporting Characters The amazing Rhea Seehorn is here and she is obviously the best part of the film having some great scenes and she is the best character in the film. This is the first thing I have seen her in since watching Better Call Saul and it is great to see that she is still really good here and despite every other part of the film faltering she doesn't for one moment. F. Murray Abraham is in this film and he is decent but his character is a bit all over the place but he is a presence on screen and it is nice to see him here. But the rest of the cast just play these generic characters that offer very little whether it be the young performers or Karen Allen of Indiana Jones fame they are bland.\n\nStory This story is absurd and not in a good way. It just doesn't work, despite a few okay performances there is nobody to really latch onto and the whole supernatural element is wasted and feels just like a reason for a wacky ending and to stretch this film to 2 hours long. It has plenty of clich\u00e9s and the last act in particular is just ridiculous and comes out of nowhere and makes these characters feel more like actors playing roles then real people. Plus the awful ending and you have a pretty terrible plot.\n\nScript The script is also bad, the dialogue does nothing to enhance the plot or its characters. It just comes across as mixed convoluted and basic and these two styles just don't mix and make this a nightmare of ideas put into one film.\n\nStyle The style of the film looks okay, it does a half decent job of showing the small scale of the place that this couple moves too and has some decent camera work and cinematography. But this film is just really boring and its pacing is lacklustre. This film should never been so long and probably could have done away with the whole supernatural aspect and it might have been a slightly better film.\n\nOverall Overall, Things Heard & Seen is a poor movie. It just lacks any interest or intrigue, it is too slow and when it does try something shocking it fails at it. Give this one a miss.\n\nRating - 3/10."

Within a half hour it becomes clear that the trailer is indeed predictive of the two-dimensional nature of the kinds of character relationships we're dealing with in this movie. I haven't read the novel but these are major points of character and plot, so I can only imagine the novel must be filled with the same boring cliches of the kind we've seen 7 million times in all kinds of movies of different genres. I'm being indirect here because I don't want to spoil anything if you decide to waste your time watching this movie. If the trailer seems fine by you then you may like the movie. If you think the trailer seems stupid and makess you roll your eyes then you probably don't want to waste your time."

It feels like for the party scene the writers just went 'What do people normally talk about at housewarming parties?' and then just put all that in whether it's appropriate or not. At one point this guy says 'Oh, yeah. I started wearing glasses when I was around 7 (or some other age idc). I really like what you've done with the place' or something like that. None of it makes sense. The story isn't powerful enough to make this movie worth it, either. And don't expect to care about these characters, they're bland as distilled water.

This film is far more poignant and has an important message to tell. Without giving it away I would definitely recommend watching this film. My only criticism would be the ending, which I felt was rushed. In short the film revolves around themes of Art, spiritualism/ seances, marital dysfunction repeated in history, and more."

I must admit that I almost didn't watch the movie, but seeing that Amanda Seyfried was the lead, I knew it was going to be good. Well, it wasn't just good, it was spectacular.\n\nFirst let's get down to the basics (without any spoilers) This movie is on the more \"spiritual\" spectrum , which I love. The conversations about life and death I resonate with entirely. I am a true believer in the afterlife so it was refreshing to see that play out in a movie. There may not be a lot of gore but the storyline, jump scares, and the acting is what pulled me in. It is very much a thriller/haunting with a good twist that keeps unfolding throughout the movie. Amanda Seyfried did a wonderful job playing the wife of a narcissistic and evil husband who couldn't stop his lies and deciet from spiraling out of control. (Okay maybe a little spoiler there) Anyways, if you love a good 70's vibe Thriller/ haunting I can assure you this movie will blow you away!!! A++ acting."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't know much about this going in. I watched a trailer before it was released, but it didn't impart much. One can't help but notice the names in the cast: Seyfried, Dyer, Abraham, Allen, Urbaniak. I gathered a sense that it's not received well, but that doesn't inherently stop me from checking out a movie.\n\nUnfortunately, in this instance, I'm inclined to agree with the naysayers: 'Things heard & seen' isn't a film that one particularly needs to hear, or see.\n\nThe cast has certainly more than proven themselves elsewhere, and they do what they can, here, with what they are given. But there's simply no subtlety to be found here, neither in the dialogue, nor in the execution of scenes generally. Catherine (Seyfried) sees a book in passing? The camera emphatically focuses on that book, and she picks it up. George (James Norton) has a scene? He's going to be a creep. A scene features a young child? The camera will focus on them in such a way as to play up the trope of spooky children. Characters who shouldn't be flirting, are flirting? They'll be super obvious about it. All this is to say nothing of how characters repeatedly make astoundingly terrible decisions.\n\nThere are themes and ideas broached in the screenplay that are worth exploring, but they are touched upon here with the same forceful lack of nuance. I'm not familiar with the book 'All things cease to appear,' by Elizabeth Brundage, that this is based on. But Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, sharing roles as writers and directors, lean extremely hard into that directness, and it's decidedly off-putting.\n\nIt's not all bad. As one might say about a house, the narrative has good bones; there are some good ideas here. But the plot is awash in such a gross lack of refinement as to blot out what value it may have had. And while fashioning itself a ghost story, the spiritualist element of the story suffers from the same quality - while also mostly vanishing from the screenplay in the second act. I don't particularly like ghost stories as it is - they generally just seem so silly to me - and this hasn't helped their case.\n\nI wanted to like this. I like the cast, and I see potential in the threads of the story. But the execution is terribly flawed, and all is for naught. 'Things heard & seen' just isn't very worthwhile."

The antagonist is so unreasonably evil but never gets any comeuppance, and the spirits that are supposedly \"there to help\" literally never do anything except make spooky sounds.\n\nThe whole thing acts as if it's building towards something and then the movie just ends with absolutely no resolution whatsoever.

I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is searching for something exiciting with plot twists or any mystery/horror involved. The storyline doesnt add up with the visuals maybe im wrong but the lady in the picture (the original owner) is mistaken with the last lady who was murdered. At least the ending could have been more fulfilling but no."

BUT, then, the film wanders all over the place, not knowing what its writers expect of their characters, the 'haunted house' setting, the back story, and o n and on. The ending is dreadful and answers nothing at all. You have wasted two hours. Norton is an actor I hope never to see again. The writing is so bad, I will make certain I avoid anything these writers work on in the future. A really awful mess of a movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "A cautionary tale for the woman married to a narcissist.\n\nMore about a doomed marriage than a haunted house, the film paints a vivid picture of a cozy close-knit town with a dark past, and expertly showcases the subtle red flags of an abusive spouse.\n\nThe acting and direction are spot-on. The characters feel real, whether warm, complex, or loathsome. The dry humor lands. The sets are beautiful, and the ghostly effects work without being over the top.\n\nAs horror goes, I'd give it a 2/5 for the fear factor - spooky but not jump-out-of-your-seat scary. There is violence but no gore/body horror or sexual violence.\n\nI subtract a star for the ending being abrupt and unsatisfactory. The pacing is consistent until the last few scenes, and while I appreciate the ending artistically, it doesn't hit the right notes emotionally. Justice is apparently served, but the evil is not undone. The seed is planted for a redemptive theme of women protecting women, but stops just short of fruition. For all their wit, grit, and wisdom, it seems the women of this town are ultimately robbed of their agency by an act of god or man."
