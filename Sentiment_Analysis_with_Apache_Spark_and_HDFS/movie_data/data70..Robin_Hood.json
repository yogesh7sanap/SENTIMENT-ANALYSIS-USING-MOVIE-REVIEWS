        "review_detailed_main": "We arguably didn't need yet another cinematic reimaging of the age old tale of Robin Hood and his merry band of followers, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, but after the last big screen treatment faired so poorly in the form of the Russell Crowe/Ridley Scott version in 2010, I for one was totally up for another stab at the classic tale, aware that the material still has the potential to entertain now just as well as it first did many moons ago.\n\nSadly the new Robin Hood is frankly not that good, an often bizarre and mostly charmless affair that sees Robin of Loxley become some type of Assassin's Creed reject that also masquerades as a GQ fashion model, as debut filmmaker Otto Bathhurst gets caught up in the joys of slow-motion instead of getting caught up on making his characters more intriguing or his film more fun.\n\nUnfortunately delivered in a mostly po-faced fashion that sits unevenly with how over the top and silly many of its big action scenes are (a machine gun like arrow barrage in Arabia or a horse chase along rooftops spring instantly to mind), Robin Hood wants to be taken seriously but it's impossible to do so, when the action and scenarios are all so off-putting and even if the action beats and slight thrills you get from some of these scenes make the film tolerable as such, there not going to change many people's opinions on the movie, feelings of which are likely to be largely negative when you look at early press and box-office results.\n\nMore comfortable with the action scenes than he is the character beats, Bathurst leads this negativity bringing Robin Hood down as he struggles to get much out of his capable cast, with Robin giving Kingsman breakout star Taron Edgerton his worst big-screen role yet, as the young performer struggles with making Robin a charismatic hero and has an equally hard time forcing any chemistry between himself and Eve Hewson as Marion, with the daughter of Bono fairing quite badly in her highest profile role yet.\n\nSide players don't fare much better, with Australian tressure Tim Minchin fairing best with his role as Friar Tuck, while the seemingly constantly struggling Jamie Foxx as Little John and the charm free Jamie Dornan as Will add little to proceedings.\n\nOutside of these unfortunate elements one of the most disappointing and eye-rolling aspects of this Robin Hood is yet another stereotypical shady bad guy turn from Ben Mendelsohn.\n\nAn unquestionably talented performer and one of our countries best acting exports, Mendelsohn delving into yet another villain role as the nefarious Sherriff of Nottingham after similar turns in the likes of Ready Player One, Rogue One, TV show Bloodline and The Dark Knight Rises begs the question of how hard the actor is trying at the moment, and while his turn here isn't \"bad\", it's certainly tiresome with all things considered, with the time now for Mendelsohn to break away from these type of roles.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nWith a handful of lively action scenes and some very brief snippets of fun, Robin Hood shows glimpses of what might've been, but with a lack of charisma, energy or smarts, this ends up being yet another version of the hooded hero that fails to hit the mark, with Robin Hood likely to be one of the year's biggest financial flops.\n\n2 medieval Molotov's out of 5"

Just enjoy the movie for what it is, which is an enjoyable and fun take on folklore."

        "review_detailed_main": "If anyone reads this, it's likely because you're either reading a bunch of reviews because you can't decide if a ticket is worth it, or you hated it and are reading all the 1 star reviews so you can say \"thank you\" multiple times when you read a criticism you agree with. If you're the latter, welcome, you're among friends. If you're the former, I'm not going to tell you that you shouldn't see or love this movie, clearly some people do, I'm just going to lay out why I can't.\n\nIt's built on clich\u00e9s and one-liners, and scenes seem to be written around setting that up, if they set it up at all. Even in the credits, next to the actors name and icon, the most dramatic quotes their character had is written next to them. Most of the lines are written to serve the drama as opposed to being substantive or sensible. There's even a scene with a mildly villainous character doing the maniacal laugher ended by angry scream with the dramatic music in the background, and it literally comes out of nowhere. There was no set up for that character doing that, and it made the whole thing feel silly. Imagine a play built only on the soliloquies of Shakespearean tragedies mixed with every clich\u00e9 about love giving strength in despair, but lacking any real sense of plot or structure. That is this film.\n\nAlso, the action sequences are filmed like an over the top modern war movie. There's literally a slo-mo scene where some of the characters are driving away from an explosion. I'm not saying there's no place for that in a period movie, but it was executed lazily and without much thought about how to do that and do justice to the combat of the time period.\n\nBasically this is just a standard subpar action movie with a Robin Hood skin. Splashy effects and dialogue with no effort given to make it cohesive or new or worthwhile. I'm usually the person in a group who's more forgiving of bad movies than others are, but I just can't with this one. I kept trying to enjoy it throughout the movie, and it felt like it was fighting me the whole time."

Of course not! This movie poster and trailer never claimed to be that. And to enjoy this film one must really just let go of the Robin Hood stories we know and love for awhile and be ready for something new.\n\nIs it going to be anything like the past Kevin Costner/Russell Crowe/Disney/Men in tights versions? Not really, nothing in the press material certainly suggested it.\n\nIs it nonsensical at some parts? Of course! It's about this dude in a hood robbing the rich in an action film. I feel the film stretched logic to just the right amount, and not so bad that it was too nonsensical to be enjoyable.\n\nIn short I'm quite surprised at the negative reviews as I felt it was fine. I walked in not expecting \"Gladiator\" or LOTR material (legends, obviously), just merely to have a good time to sit back, shut my mind from outside, to watch some mad archery skills and action sequences - and I say it delivered what was on the cover, no more no less."

A lot of it is super dumb action movie stuff, i.e. MTV style training montage, which can be fun but then the film injects political commentary to make it socially relevant., i.e. Robin is a Crusader and Little Jon is a Muslim. It all ended up being a mismash of tone, style and seriousness that grated on my nerves.\n\nI also must say that the film had some of the laziest plotting in recent memory. At one point a character, and this is why I left, directly stated his nefarious intentions and plan in detail to Robin because one just vouched for Robin.\n\nThis film was a waste of time.

        "review_detailed_main": "Reminds me of last year's re-imagining of King Arthur except a heist film this is not. Robin Hood gets his umpteenth retelling yet the film insists it's telling a new version of the story while also basically covering all you already know about the man himself. Steal from the rich, give to the poor; it's not complicated, and open to a million different interpretations of that core loop, yet here we are.\n\nFor a movie to tease some promising themes at the start (if you ignore the awful opening bit of narrative catch-up that mismatches the film's tone with twee voice over and the weakest relationship setup imaginable) only to glance over them for flat characters is a little mean, because it makes you think it might not be half bad for at least a half an hour. It could have opened with the first major action sequence, which may be the best part of the film, as it is a far cry from where the action goes from there. Robin, of course, is a man of great character, even before his transformation into a thief proper. Where the film immediately goes wrong is establishing a context to the conflict he is drafted into fighting, which clearly includes rampant racism, imperialism, and intolerance of ideology. Like I said, promising themes at first, but Ben Mendelsohn as the Sheriff of Nottingham is not a person you'll come to understand. He could hardly get more cartoonish, and during his growly monologues I wondered if this movie was actually intended for children.\n\nI think it is and it isn't as it's suitably violent but without blood which in some instances appears to have been intended. Robin himself racks up quite the body count in his efforts to steal from the absurdly rich Sheriff, dragging presumably innocent lives into his own personal vendetta (which is fueled by Jamie Foxx, who goes back and forth between playing Jamie Foxx and Jamie Foxx's vague interpretation of an \"Arab\", quotes included). But because he gets results, the community rallies around him. Off screen, mostly, so that when it comes time to rally the town against the Sheriff (though one wonders why they never left if they were forced to give everything they owe to the war) they all get behind him.\n\nThere is a lot of conflicting or lazy character choices in the film, too many to get into great detail, but they keep resetting any feelings you may develop naturally when a movie is--how you say--consistent. On top of that, accents are a complete afterthought. The lead actress, an Irish actor, can't even keep an accent in her native tongue for more than a sentence every other scene she's in. The rest of the time she's speaking plain American English like everyone's afraid to remind her of her character's betrothal to another Irishman, Jamie Dornan. Oh yeah, he's in this, and his character's arc is, in order: nonexistent, then confusing and script-serving, then literally Two-Face from The Dark Knight in a categorically stupid franchise setup that promises to tell the exact same story again next time.\n\nAny sort of personality or wit the film has is lost in the incompetent action scenes that are a complete joke. Its costuming is interesting, but feels weird and ultimately ephemeral. At times it was like a cross between Game Of Thrones and The Matrix. I also thought the film was going to end after a particularly large set piece (which includes a horse-drawn cart being driven through a wall) because the inane plotting felt sweetly dumb enough to be mercifully short, but it kept slogging on for maybe 45 more minutes. I wouldn't give this one its franchise money, if only so that Taron Edgerton can put his alright charisma towards something else."

        "review_detailed_main": "Quite possibly the greatest rendition of the classic \"Robin Hood\" story is the 1938 \"Adventures of Robin Hood,\" starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. The film begins with an initiative, and uses its protagonists to advance the plot methodically. Perhaps most importantly lies the film's self awareness; its delight in relishing a sense of refreshing fun and delight. The classic tale of Robin Hood has always been one best told briskly and with a sense of humor.\n\nIf only this film had followed the 1938 template. It starts out with an obvious purpose; to retell the Robin Hood legend in a modern form. This is reinforced through the bizzare steampunk costuming and one out of place scene in which Marion (played by the adequate, but not particularly noticeable Eve Hewson) wears a bedazzaled mermaid gown. Also, the film establishes the romance between Marion and Robin Hood as a key element, and presents her as, essentially, Robin's only motivation for almost the whole of the film. This is not inherently a bad decision, but the movie fails to present their relationship in a compelling or interesting way. There is no reason, no foundation, for us to feel invested in Robin's motivation, and thereby, his origin story.\n\nThe effects are borderline amateur. This film does right by incorporating a lot of detailed set pieces, that create a believable environment. On the occassion that green screen is used, however, it reminds you of a 2000's era Star Wars prequel. While the choreography regarding Taron Egerton's Robin Hood and Jamie Foxx's Little John is somewhat competent, the battle sequences are shot nonsensically with no direction or focus.\n\nOne thing this film struggles immensely with is character building. As mentioned above, there is no depth to the romance between Robin Hood and Marion. Little John and Robin Hood, despite all the scenes they have together, have no real conversation. I felt that Little John was the only character I even slightly felt for, because he was the only person with a semblance of a backstory.\n\nIt was incredibly stupid, convuluted, and cheap. I'm not saying there weren't compelling elements, but ultimately, those were bogged down by the film's idiocy.\n\n2/10\n\n20% (Rotten)\n\nD"

They don't like the modern reworking of something they really liked as kids, like the Errol Flynn version, or, *shudder* the Kevin Costner one 4. They don't like its fast and loose interpretation of the myth of Robin Hood 5. They don't like it being sympathetic towards a Muslim.\n\nSo. I saw it with my 12 year old son, who described it as 'lit'. It feels like it's got a fair amount of social commentary. There's plenty of diversity (including Little John). The parallels with modern day war interventions are made blindingly obvious.\n\nIt's a bit like Snatch, or Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels meets the Merrie Men. You have to like that in your face British attitude to enjoy it, but also let go of the idea that there was nothing else at play in 14th century England.\n\nThe baneful influence of the Catholic Church is very well done, and the fight scenes are quite enjoyable. There really isn't too much gore and violence, so I'd say this is quite suitable for kids who like action movies.\n\nThe only bad part from my point of view (and not my son's) was the speech that was supposed to inspire the locals to fight against the Sheriff's bad guys. It was terrible. And uninspiring. And luckily only lasted about two minutes before we got back to good guys beating up bad guys.\n\nThere's lots of explosions, decent bow and arrow fights, and general mayhem to make this a really enjoyable Friday night movie. We watched it on a Tuesday. Made it feel like a Friday, and the movie whizzed by.\n\nI was going to give this 10 stars to counter the 1 star reviews that are way out of line, but I've edited it to make it a 7."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm in a weird situation here. It is currently the night before this movie's release, 11/20. However, I was lucky enough to watch this yesterday night, 11/19. The reviewing embargo was still up when I got home, and was up this afternoon as well. This is the earliest I can alert the public about what I saw.\n\nWhat I watched was an absolute train-wreck. I'm confident in my position as declaring this the worst movie of 2018.\n\nI can't really structure this review like my others, because it's been 24 hours and I've already forgotten half the movie. So allow me to just run through some bullet points so you can see my stance, and not fall into the same trap as me. I had free popcorn, optimal seating, and a seat warmer. I had a terrible time.\n\n* No character goes through any arc. Everyone feels the same by the end of the movie as they do at the start, which might seem crazy as they set up Robin Hood as some rich guy. But his \"heart of gold\", his attitude, his outlook on life, barely changes throughout the runtime. He never really flaunted his wealth, heck he inherited his castle, and he got drafted into the army regardless. He didn't even fight back against that.\n\n* Quick cutting action scenes! Oh do I love action sequences where I can't tell what's going on. Man I love it when they show the same thing in 3 quick cuts that give you a headache.\n\n* Bland sound design. People getting shot with arrows doesn't sound like people getting shot with arrows. It sounds like I thwacked my countertop.\n\n* Failure to capture the setting. For a movie set around the middle ages, people are talking very... not middle age-y. As well as the clothing and sets themselves really not feeling like that either. It felt more like I was watching a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.\n\n* The villain is hilariously bad. In his first scene he does an anime cape swish. Ben Mendelsohn got a lucky break with Rogue One, and I like him in that mainly because it's so bad it's funny. I thought it was a joke performance, like he was having fun with the dialogue. WE STAND HERE AMIDST MY ACHIEVEMENT, NOT YOURS! And unfortunately he hasn't had a good role since, and this one further cements that. \"I'm going to boil you in your own piss\" in a hissing voice and not his shouting voice. Hissing Ben is much much much worse than shouting Ben.\n\n* Speaking of the acting, all of it is bad. You can blame both the script and the actors on this one, as the dialogue sucks and everyone loves to speak soft and fast in hisses and slurs.\n\n* Technically speaking, this movie is a farce. Sometimes effects aren't even rendered properly. On one occasion the camera wasn't even the right lens, it was like a grainy security camera. That shot is used twice, in case you miss it the first time. Sometimes shots last longer than needed at times and you can tell the actors are trying to signal for a cut. There was one time where a shot with Jamie Foxx lasted a little too long and he fell out of character.\n\n* Too fast. This movie is about three paces ahead of a good pacing for a movie like this. I realized I had been there for 20 minutes and it felt more like 2 minutes. At least the torture was over quickly.\n\n* Forgettable. This movie reminds me too much of Ben Hur 2016, and that isn't a good thing. No good comedy to keep it light, no tension filled scenes, no good action, no good stakes, no good characters, no good drama... no good. As such large chunks of the movie are missing in my mind.\n\nTL;DR, don't waste your time. A lot can be accomplished in 2 hours that isn't sitting in the dark watching this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Robin Hood (3.5 out of 5 stars).\n\nRobin Hood is a decent action adventure film that is probably one of the several adaptations of the character. Last one I have seen was probably Ridley Scott's Robin Hood film with Russell Crowe which the movie had a epic battle. This film does have a lot of action sequences, some decent performances with Taron Egerton as Robin Hood. I felt like the film was lacking the inspirational story. Director focused too much on having fast editing cuts of action and explosions but was lacking in building a story around the character.\n\nIt was lacking plot depth. The film begins with Robin (Taron Egerton) who catches Marian (Eve Hewson) trying to steal from him. Which they both fall in love with each other. The love story between them two felt a little rushed. Which is how the beginning of the movie felt like. When Sheriff of Nottingham (Ben Mendelsohn) drafted Robin to go into war. Robin is then sent out. Were he picks up archery. And fighting an enemy which he questions his commander. Years later, he comes back home to find his property is taken back by the Sheriff and Marian has moved on to Will (Jamie Dornan) and is helping with the people in working the mines. As the Sheriff is raising the taxes and stealing from the people. When Robin is trained by John (Jamie Foxx) and planning on stealing from the rich such as the Sheriff to give back to the poor.\n\nThe plot was lacking in development. The love story between Robin and Marian felt rushed. There barely was much to the plot. Besides Jamie Foxx's character training Robin Hood to be the hood in stealing back from the corrupted leader and giving back to the people. There was a lot of entertaining action sequences.\n\nTaron Egerton was okay as Robin Hood. He did not deliver a terrible performance or anything. Jamie Foxx was decent as John, his mentor and trainer. Ben Mendelsohn was a tedious boring villain. Eve Hewson was okay as well as Robin's love interest. And Jamie Dornan playing her love interest was also a forgettable role.\n\nThis film tried feeling like it had a modern touch on the character. Characters costume design felt like it was more modern than taking place in its own time.\n\nOverall, Robin Hood is a pretty fair action adventure film. If you could put aside the modern costume design and lacking a story. Which it captures the concept idea of Robin Hood stealing from Sheriff of Nottingham and giving back towards the poor. It feels lifeless with the lacking of a story. It does have a lot of fast editing cuts action sequences and a decent cast ensemble."

They asked me what I was seeing and I could tell by their reaction they didn't think I was going to have a good experience. One of them said \"I saw it last night and it wasn't that great\" (they have free screenings for the staff). I knew this meant it had been horrid. I said \"well I like most everything at least a bit\" (I do) and went in. The film was worse than I imagined it could be and it indeed turned out to be one of those rare films I didn't like at all. What was wrong? Basically everything. The plot was just unbelievably bad, the costumes were bizarre, and the acting was, well I don't even think calling it acting was appropriate. What in the world was going on and why was Jamie Foxx's character even in it (I'm sure his reason for being in the film was along the line's of Michael Caine's for being in Jaws: The Revenge, the house he bought with the paycheck was really nice). Taron Egerton has to do a better job of selecting his roles. As bad as Billionaire Boys Club was, this makes that seem like Citizen Kane.

Also the villain the sheriff of Nottingham was great in his role.\n\nAll in all if u love robin films get this to your collection. it's fast paced tried to do smg different and if it hadn't had too much cgi in the battles and also if they handled the love story more carefully it would be a great film.\n\nnever the less this gets above the average grade easily.\n\nB- = 7 out of 10 from me and of course I will get this in to my collection.\n\nthere are a few robin films better than this one and a lot more worst.\n\nTHE TOP 12 ROBIN HOOD // IVANHOE FILMS & SERIES OF ALL TIME\n\nIvanhoe 1952 Ivanhoe 1997 // tv series Adventures of robin hood 1938 Adventures of robin hood 1955 // tv series The sword of Sherwood forest 1960 Ivanhoe 1982 Robin of Sherwood 1984 // tv series Robin hood the prince of thieves 1991 princess of thieves 2001 Robin hood 2006 // tv series Robin hood 2010 Robin hood 2018"

Slow motion. Bad sets. Blah blah blah.\n\nY'all don't quit your day jobs. If you want to see a Robin Hood really deserving of a low score, see this one that came out earlier in 2018; search IMDb for: Robin Hood: The Rebellion (2018)\n\nSure this film had it's issues, but certainly undeserving of all these 1's. This is novice director Otto Bathurst's first full length feature film. Considering that, his directing was great compared to some recent films with more seasoned directors. This is the first and only writing/screenplay credit for amateur writer Ben Chandler. Considering the many versions of Robin Hood in existence, I really enjoyed this story - more of a prequel to the Hood's beginnings.\n\nThe 116 min length didn't feel that long, as the pacing was on point. All actors performed great, and Jamie Foxx and Taron Egerton were perfectly cast. Sure the fire CGI could have been better, but all other S/VFX were done really well.\n\nI'm really shocked at how bad this film is rated. I saw it with a bunch of people and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. It was fun and entertaining with nothing to nitpick. This film is a solid 7, and nothing deserving less than a 6, nor worthy of a 10. Ignore the wannabe salty critics and don't nitpick - just enjoy the entertainment and production value this film has to offer. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.

Locksley is about 45 miles from Nottingham and not on the outskirts as in the movie, also Nottingham is not on the coast or accessible by water ways from the sea yet the ship Robin arrives home on seems to arrive there. Let's take that pin out, the story seems to jettison most of what is the common interpretation of the legend by totally sidelining most of Robin's Merry men but does set up for a possible and I have to say unwelcome sequel, so maybe they'll use them then. Yes it's a new take on the story but unfortunately it's also a bad one"

        "review_title": "Slightly Anachronistic and Revisionist, Lacking in any Sophistication, but not Unwatchable",
        "review_detailed_main": "While at first this movie seems to aim off the mark, once you accept the movie for what it is and understand its flow (if you can), you realize that it hits the bull's-eye on being an offbeat, anachronistic, revisionist Historical Action/Suspense Drama. The dialogue is fairly uncultured and unintelligent -- borderline soapy at times -- but it never pretends to be more sophisticated than it is. Though the dialogue is throughly pedestrian, the locales, sets, wardrobes, and visuals are all rich with detail and variety. Granted, the fashions and architecture are in many instances unfitting if viewed through the lens of historical accuracy, but it is clear from the outset that historical accuracy is not one of the movie's goals.\n\nThe plot, though nothing ambitious, manages to be a little unpredictable by virtue of not adhering too closely to the source material but intentionally detouring a number of times in pursuit of a fresh take on things (for better or worse -- usually (regrettably) the latter). The messaging of the film is preachy and worn on its sleeve, and while shades of grey are cast liberally on the protagonists and deuteragonists to (though meagerly) flesh them out, the same courtesy is not extended to any of the antagonists, leaving them utterly corrupt, duplicitous, mercenary, uncaring, and without conscience, painting a very stark picture of \"heroes, broken but ultimately good; villains, cosmically and unequivocally evil beyond repair\", which is a lazy depiction of any cast of characters or societal structure, at best. It's uncertain if the filmmakers set out to make a shallow story of 'good versus evil' and were set upon subverting whatever they could to achieve those ends, or if they had an agenda of \"making it clear\" that, just as in their contrived narrative for this film, all government is bound to become corrupt (and once corrupt, ruthless and two-faced to its core) and virtually all religious institutions are evil incarnate, hellbent on attaining power, influence and adulation, and committed to employing whatever falsehoods, cruelties and treacheries are at their disposal to arrive at those ends. I'd like to think the filmmakers are not so shallow as to think corruption is something only institutions, organizations, and governments are subject to, or that the only time someone can truly be evil is when they join the ranks of those in wealth or power, for it's common sense that anyone has the capacity for good or evil in his heart, and no matter his rank or position in life, can cause harms great and small. I'm simply hoping they only set out to tell a tale of good-vs-evil (no matter where either may sprout up), and that they simply hammed it up a bit much.\n\nSo in review, this is a weird, offbeat, unintelligent mess of a film... but it's still fun and visually appealing. It's a completely skippable movie, but a once-through should prove to be not without some enjoyment.\n\n5.5/10.0\n\n(PS: sorry for the sloppy and impromptu structure of this review; I was mostly jotting down whatever sentiments and takeaways were present in my head while the movie was still fresh in my mind.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Am a fan of the character of Robin Hood and his adventures, such colourful characters (not just Robin) and stories high in entertainment value and intrigue. Film adaptations have varied, most good, with the definitive version being easily the 1938 Errol Flynn film, a personal favourite of mine. So there was a lot of potential for this version, on top of it having an interesting film and wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible.\n\n'Robin Hood' turned out to be a huge disappointment on almost every level. One of the year's worst for me, which has generally been a hit and miss but mostly worthwhile year, and one of its most disappointing. As far as Robin Hood adaptations go, it is for me the worst (worse than Russell Crowe's version, yes you've seen right) and so way off what a film of the character and stories should be, the complete opposite in fact. Considering its potential, 'Robin Hood' should not have misfired the way it did. Having said that, will say right now that there are far worse films overall out there and it is not even among the worst of the films seen recently by me.\n\nThere were a few things from personal opinion that stopped it from being a complete disaster. There is some nice scenery. Occasionally the light comic relief is amusing.\n\nWhile the acting mostly is very bad, Tim Minchin as Friar Tuck does lighten things up when he appears, the one person who doesn't take it too seriously without jarring.\n\nHowever, Taron Egerton in the title role brings very little to the role other than one-dimensional scowling, no charisma or swagger here. Jamie Foxx comes over as having walked onto the wrong set because he belonged in a completely different film altogether, he achieves the impossible at making a crucial character such as Little John out of place and serving little point to the story. Eve Hewson struggles as an underwritten Maid Marion, while there has never been a blander Will Scarlet than Jamie Dornan or a hammier Sheriff of Nottingham than the usually reliable Ben Mendelssohn. The character development is near-non existent and indecisive when there is any, which makes it impossible to root for the characters. The only characters that the film tries to develop are Will and the Sheriff. Unfortunately neither come off well, Will's is dull and confused and the Sheriff's is pointless, weird and makes little sense.\n\nFurthermore, the script is run-of-the-mill at best and generally horrendously stilted with misplaced humour that isn't funny and anachronisms galore. The music is alright on its own but doesn't fit, while the direction is sluggish throughout. The story is rushed through which makes for a lack of coherence at times, while also being dully paced and mostly taking it far too seriously. The action may be elaborate somewhat but it's also chaotic with no tension or any sense of jeopardy or peril. The costumes are as much of an all over the place mishmash as the accents, which made the film unintentionally bizarre, and the film has the look of a very early video game.\n\nSumming up, not a disaster but severely lacking in the entertainment and thrills departments. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

The actors can only do so much with that so it's not their fault they're in such a stinker.\n\nThe script was aweful, the costumes were rediculous, it was like a action'y rock and roll music video, Fast and Furious or Transformers but with arrows and no character development whatsoever.\n\nI think you needed to be a teenage girl with a crush on Taron to like this movie because the only ones laughing in all the right places at the \"jokes\" in the movie were the ones sitting behind me."

FAR better than Kevin Costner who, honestly, should go down as the WORST RH ever (!) and, sadly, pitted against the late great Alan Rickman (the BEST Nottingham ever). The script & dialogue rough at times due to logic flaws which were distracting. Action sequences were exciting and very well done. I wasn't crazy about the decision to use contemporary costumes in some of the scenes--it didn't work for me but that didn't take away. Message relevant to today, certainly, but not terribly heavy-handed. All in all, a lot of fun; glad I saw it in the theater/on the big screen, rather than wait for DVD."

Why not create your own period piece in that case but hey that would have required some imagination I guess.\n\nTim Minchin was in this, which was nice to see but he wasnt enough to pull the movie up.

Is actually a very refreshing reboot of an over done, and frankly quite boring tale of a skilled bowman stealing from the rich and redistributing to the poor. A children friendly take on socialism really.\n\nIt's a very enjoyable story in its original form sure, but how many times do you have to reinvent the wheel for it the become boring? Not many times I've found when it comes to Robin Hood movies.Robin Hood (2010) and this 2018 remake of the classic tale are very enjoyable, fresh faces. This remake features all your favorite characters from the tale in a new light. With some spectacular, albeit heavily CGI action scenes to go with it. The action scenes are really quite intuitive and feels like a modern shooter movie in a way at times.\n\nIf you watch this movie expecting it to be like the original Robin Hood tale, you may not enjoy it, but, if you are tired of the same tale and want something new you will enjoy this movie."

Taron and Jamie Foxx bring humour, excellent archery skills and a great dose of action to the movie that sold it for me. Personally, I wouldn't have called it Robin Hood as it is only loosely based on the character and instead made it as a movie about injustice and greed that not happened back then but still happens today."

Distorted views about the crusades. The most embarrassing part of the movie is the very end, where Bathurst has the arrogance of suggesting a sequel.

It sets itself in an ambiguous time frame, although still against the background of the crusades the scenes from the war themselves are styled more like JarHead and the Hurt Locker. Again this appears a deliberate device to remove you from the traditional tale and into the broader themes of the film. If you want a 'classic' Robin Hood story then this is not for you, but it is an entertaining enough film, well put together. Although it does rather simplistically try to hammer home it's point, if you watch with an open mind and no expectations of what you want from a Robin Hood story, then it's worth a couple of hours of your time. Stylistically reminiscent of Ian McKellen's Richard the Third, although not quite on par!"

Little John is now a black Muslim you see, hell bent on social justice. Every time you see him you are taken out of the film and reminded of a modern day agenda. It's enough to destroy the film by itself. There's plenty more that makes it farcical that I could go into but I've just had lunch and I'd really like to keep it down if I could.

I love the original, still enjoyed this enough to buy it. The actors were amazing, the storyline is more fitting of the time period. Yes, Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman are untouchable. Why then should this movie attempt to remake or out do Prince of Thieves? Do yourselves a favor and watch as if you don't know the other exists. Only then will you be able to say you love BOTH Robin Hood movies. I'm tired of everyone putting this movie down. It deserves praise."

He's happy to live a comfortable life with his love Marian (Eve Hewson) until he is drafted to fight the Crusade. In Arabia, he comes to the aid of enemy prisoner Little John (Jamie Foxx) and his son. The son is killed anyways and Little John loses a hand. When Robin returns home, the Sheriff of Nottingham (Ben Mendelsohn) had stolen everything from everyone including his estate. Little John joins him after stowaway on his ship. Marian had thought that he had been killed. Will Scarlet (Jamie Dornan) is a lord trying to care for the villagers who have been forced to work in the mines. With Little John's help, Robin becomes the Hood, a vigilant stealing from the Sheriff and giving to the poor.\n\nHistory accuracy be damned. From the machine gun crossbows to the high wire arrow work, it is a movie of ludicrous action. One has to overlook a lot of questionable writing. It should be easy for Little John to be motivated by a life debt for his son. Instead, it's a lot mumble jumble about anti-war social justice. I have no problem with that in general but his son's death is so much more personally powerful. There is still fun to be had despite the wonky writing. It's better than some of those other recent Robin Hood reworks. For that, I give this a passing mark."

        "review_detailed_main": "Generally speaking, cinema is a form of art. When attending a screening, people want to enjoy this form of art. Personally I rarely enjoy the serious movies and applaud those who dare to go little tongue-on-the-cheek, especially in the case of movies.\n\n\"Robin Hood\" indeed is a work of art when put in the right context: A context in which a child takes a piece of string, to which the said child then attaches macaronis and alas, we have jewellery. In other words, \"Robin Hood\" is like a macaroni necklace of movies. Except of course, the necklace in this case is made by adults, and no one asked for a macaroni-necklace in the first place.\n\nThe story is as thin as the string holding the figurative necklace together. It is littered with enough goofs to think they were put in the movie deliberately, making me think for a second that the movie is a satirical parody. I was constantly expecting a character to enter the scenes and shake his/her head in a disbelieving manner at the sheer idiocy and cheesiness of the encounters. That person never appeared and no comedy-relief was given, leaving me to conclude that this was done in all seriousness. Indeed there was such a plethora of irrational decisions made throughout the movie, that a whole sequel could be made just to address them. And to be clear, we are not talking about a short-movie either.\n\nIf the story can be described as the string, then the macaronis would be the actors. So many well known actors, yet only Abraham was able to be convincing in my eyes. Jamie Foxx is always a hit-or-miss, and his performance in this bungle is parallel to the accuracy and tempo of Robin Hood himself, if the protagonist was, well, blind or having lost an arm...or two.\n\nSometimes you may absolutely love the macaroni necklace you receive, but this one falls apart the moment it is handed to you. It is by no means meant to be taken seriously, as after all, it is simply a macaroni necklace. However, even in this category, it is an unusually clumsy and forgettable little trinket.\n\nRating 2/10 - For the possibility that this was some sort of a satirical parody that I was too simple-minded to properly understand."

Then there are times throughout the movie when it seems like present day, especially some of the costumes. It took me a minute to buy into the relationship between John and Robin. Robin and Marian lacked the chemistry the characters have had in other adaptations. It was puzzling to me how Marian remained so pristine throughout the movie.\n\nThe editing is questionable and I am actually curious to see what scenes made it to the cutting room. I definitely would advise you to see it on the big screen but spring for matinee."

        "review_detailed_main": "Robin Hood (2018) continues the long tradition of blockbuster remakes with millennial-aimed takes that also lead into potential franchise origins. It also continues the tradition of that absolutely falling on its arse.\n\nTo say that Robin Hood is entirely bad would be doing it a disservice, it has nothing on the misguided Ridley Scott film that I honestly recall nothing of except for its opening scene. Though it also stands nowhere near its peers like Prince of Thieves, the Disney animated version, or Errol Flynn (not even Men in Tights, though it does have as much humour, though unintentional)\n\nTaron Egerton has a lot on his plate trying to seriously get through this flick for a paycheck and another potential franchise (that won't ever be a franchise) While he certainly did his part training to shoot arrows (trained by notoriously viral and impractical archer Lars Andersen), he's thrown into a world of poorly constructed action and special effects amid a screenplay packed with tonnes of groans and cliches of the last two decades of cinema.\n\nThe first cinematic feature of Otto Bathurst definitely shows. Robin Hood screams of unoriginality of vision and a copy/paste job to create exactly this type of movie. Everything is numbing and basic, with the thinnest allegories and the most transparent influences, whether we're going war in the Middle East being EXACTLY like war in the Middle East now down to insurgents and ambushed and street warfare to even the Crusaders' armour looking exactly like modern day army loadouts, or to the remainder of the film, which couldn't be more like The Dark Knight unless Ben Mendelssohn put on white face-paint.\n\nAnd Ben Mendelssohn does nothing new. He is a fantastic actor and a brilliant villain to cast, but you can tell he phones it in with clenched jaw, shouting, and speeches that sound like every speech ever. Your Robin Hood is only as strong as your Sheriff of Nottingham, and here it is weak sauce.\n\nHood's future merry Men need some work too. Tim Minchin is a joy to see given acting roles, but goddamn he's another member of the Sean Connery school of acting which his Australian being unmistakable. Jamie Foxx is a delight but only because how hammy he is as an Arabic Little John. There's a moment where he cauterises the stump of his arm which makes for unintentional hilarity.\n\nThe key phrase of this movie. Unintentional hilarity. When you're not calling a play by play of The Dark Knight down to even the return of Robin as Bruce Wayne coming up against Marion as Rachel and Jamie Dornan's Will as Harvey Dent, you're discovering just how stupid this movie wants to go. Even the unbelievable nature of Nottingham being perpetually on fire shooting sparks on every street corner. Even the costume design that's as inconsistent as the editing. Even the party scene that comes out of nowhere that feels like the casino scene of any Bond movie, where the fashion and hair design is inconceivable, where extras are dressed by Jean Paul Gottier and all we need now is Jamie Foxx dressed as Ruby Rhod trying to find Corbin Dallas.\n\nRobin Hood is unfortunately not a barrel of bad laughs for the entirety of the runtime. There is plenty of opportunity to riff off the material with friends (including trying to decipher how one would \"drown in a cage\"), but it doesn't quite hit glory levels of bad-good.\n\nAnother entry in the failed franchise cinematic universe, Robin Hood is a Netflix at best, rental at worst. Seeing it with a crowd will not help, it will just get you told off for laughing way too hard at Jamie Foxx thinking sticking his arm stump into a smelting pot is a good idea.\n\nSeriously. What is this movie? It's not enough to warrant more, so unfortunately..."

It was a fresh take on a classic. If you are looking for the classic story, that's not it. And it literally tells you that from the get go. I thought it was great."

Ruining the story of Robin Hood is exactly what they managed to do in this movie. This confused, and completely idiotic version turned political lecture does nothing for the legend of one of the most famous thieves. Instead it mixes modern warfare but with bows. It mixes the invasions of Muslim armies with modern day immigration. It even makes up modern looking armours and swords with repeater machine crossbows to try and recreate what the D Day landing was. It's a pathetic movie with poor actors and a horrible story. Had they called it something else instead of Robin Hood, I might have given it 3 stars just to be nice."

Hopefully the reviews don't hold back a potential sequel. I would definitely go see a Part II."

The action scenes make you think that they are trying to replicate modern warfare movies. I'm 100% certain that the director has never seen a middle age period piece movie or tv show. Not a single costume looks like it fits a robin hood movie. The guards all use repeating crossbows, which was never really a thing in England. Crossbow bolts tore through cement walls like bullets. I saw a sword like one time...in a movie set in the MIDDLE AGES!!! The set design of Nottingham looks like they took inspiration from the orc mining pits in the Lord of the Rings. The only positive thing that I can say about the movie is the acting is ok. Seriously the costume design just gets worse and worse the longer you watch it."

I don't love sitting through 3 hour movies! Also, I loved the filming of the war scenes. People can hate on the slow motion and quick cuts all they want, but I thought it was thrilling. Not sure what people were expecting that left them so disappointed in a good movie, but I would recommend this if you like action movies and want to be entertained."

You dont watch it for academy award winning acting either. This movie is for pure and sheer entertainment. And entertain it does. Theres no edge of your seat suspense nor does it leave one cheering for the action - its just another action film that really lets you sit back and enjoy a movie for, again, entertainment. Im was more drawn by the impeccable styling of the wardrobes than the story itself. Very fashionable attire throughout the movie. Friar Tuck was a bit of a kooky character that i didnt enjoy. Lady Mariam didnt sell me as a madam of her era but moreso a gal that was sent back in time from the future. Robin Hood himself wasnt convincing as Im used to more of a darker type of hero, but he faired well as an action film star - but i simply couldnt shake him as a Kingsman. Jamie Foxx as John has a good character build for future flicks but he still had too much \"Foxx\" like tendancies for me to believe him as Brother John. Overall, i came without much expectations and left not thrilled nor disappointed. Just entertained on a Saturday night. If you like the big screen - go check it out. But you wouldnt be missing much if you waited for the DVD."

The story is decent and even solid, the visuals are very good, the whole movie is very beatiful. Yes, it lacks historical accuarcy, but tell me which story of Robin Hood is close to the real historic facts enough to be true. There is no such a story at all, because Robin Hood is a legend himself, he is a fictive character, that never existed in real life. Yes, Nottingham has no resemblance to the 14th century Nottingham in real life, yes every location is out of ages. But it was the creators' thought. They wanted to make a Robin Hood movie not related to a specific historical period, it's just a bold attempt to experiment with a famous story. And I think this attempt was a success. It's not just an action flick, it asks many inconvenient questions about numerous social problems, like poverty, squalor, social inequalty and vice versa."

I watched the newest incarnation of Robin Hood, the 2018 version starring Targon Egerton, doing his best Ewan McGregor impersonation, and Jamie Foxx doing an impression of Jamie Foxx.\n\nFor those not familiar with the story, spoilers follow. The story is set somewhere between 1066 and 1945 depending on who's clothing you're looking at. Robin Hood starts as a young Lord of the Manor named Bruce Wayne of Loxley.\n\nOrphaned at a young age for no explained reason (though I suspect his parents were bowed down outside the theater) young Bruce of Loxley is drafted into Steam Punk Arabia where he learns the art of war and the meaning of mostly-off-camera-because-we're-going-for-PG-13 senseless cruelty & violence.\n\nThere he meets Ra's Al Guhl (aka: \"John\") who later trains him in the art of Arabian Ninjago. He uses these skills to take on the Catholic Empire lead by the evil Darth Bishop & Cardinal Palpatine as they use their loyal servant Director Krennic of Nottingham (played by Ben Mendelsohn channelling the late Alan Rickman turned up to 11).\n\nWhat follows is a rollicking tale of thievery, arrow-fu, & wagon chases through the Mines of Mordor. There's a great sequence with Ra's al Ben Hur running from Boba Gisborne followed by a sharp left through The Italian Job. Throughout the action, young Bruce needlessly leaps over non-existent objects & rapidly fires arrows that must be kept hidden in some spacious orifice since he's never seen with a quiver.\n\nBut wait, that's not all! We can add hastily-added political intrigue as Maid Marian Organa searches for the hidden proof of (completely non-historical) evidence of collusion and a three-way love triangle between young Bruce, Marion, & Cesar Chavez.\n\nHighly recommended for those looking for two solid hours of W-freakin-TF."

The Legend yoy Know , the Story you don't . \"There's been whispers of a thief ...\" The untold story behind the legend . A thief's Work is Never Done . Outlaw , Warrior , Hero.\n\nThis breathtaking movie has great action scenes and overwhelming set pieces , but being extremely unrealist. This is a revisionist recounting freely based on the vintage legend , about characters , history and time when is set the action , as it is developed mostly at a dark town , in a dirty , gritty Middle Age , without Notthinghan forests , no traditional woods , but old buildings , though there are also impressive palaces . That's why the spectators disapproved the changes of Robin Hood's ordinary cannon . Here even doesn't appear neither Will Scarlett , nor Little John , nor king John Without Land , nor Richard Lionheart , but an ominous Cardinal played by F. Murray Abraham . Average performances abound , as Taron Egerton gives a so-so acting as the brave hero who tries to deliver justice and peace at whatever cost . While his pal results a be a Muslim from the Crusades performed by Jamie Foxx in a similar role to Morgan Freeman of Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves . Along with the beautiful Eve Hewson as Marian , singer Bono's daughter , Ben Mendelshon giving the nasty interpretation as villain Sheriff of Notthinghan , Jamie Dorman as Will Tillman , Tim Minchin as Friar Tuck, Ian Peck , F Murray Abraham , among others .\n\nOther better version about this classic role are the following ones : the classic \" The adventures of Robin Hood\" by Michael Curtiz with Errol Flynn , Olivia de Havilland , Basil Rathbone , Claude Rains .

And the actor learning to shoot three arrows a second (in real life) for the role definitely made the action feel just as epic as you'd expect a Green Arrow movie to be, while still feeling very realistic.\n\nI fail to see everyone's problem with this film, especially the critics'. \"Needlessly action packs a classic tale\" my foot. The whole point of this Robin Hood is to be different than the others. I think it did a splendid job of doing so and I will definitely be seeing this movie multiple times in the theaters before buying it the second it's available.\n\nHere's hoping they do a sequel regardless of what critics' say. This movie deserves it.\n\nI feel like a lot of movies that get mostly negative reviews are because the people that would leave a positive one see all the negative ones and decide not to watch it.

And by the time Robin is serving in the Holy Land and everyone has a very distinct uniform which includes a t-shirt, any attempt at any medieval period attire has been totally discarded.\n\nSo far as the storyline is concerned the whole is not much better - a letter drafting Robin for the Third Crusade (yes, it does say \"Third Crusade\"). A Draft Letter - REALLY? And does no-one seem to understand that Robin id a LORD - this is not a cowboy film, or at least it isn't supposed to be.\n\nThe whole feels as though it was written, costumed, directed and produced without any knowledge of the historical period and only the very slightest knowledge of the legend of Robin Hood.\n\nI accept that Robin Hood is a legend -and it is therefore easy to play fast and loose with the story but this movie goes far beyond that and bears little or resemblance to the legend, beyond some character's' names, and absolutely none to history.\n\nIf you want a good Robin Hood film then there are plenty out there from Errol Flynn to Kevin Costner. It is to be hoped that this appalling movie disappears before it damages the joy of Robin and Marian, Friar Tuck, Little John et al for a generation of children.\n\nAvoid it and just watch \"Prince of Thieves\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "From the start of this movie, everything is just bad.... The director clearly ignores ANY semblance of historic accuracy or even reality. Machine gun balistas, crusaders apparently only fighting with bows, and explosive catapult stones. This continues throughout the movie, where any historic realism is forfeit. It seems like the director wanted to create a \"First Knight\" esque feel, but falling completely flat instead. Jamie Foxx is horrendous, talking and acting 100% like an American throughout the movie. Lastly the Robin Hood tale is completely in this movie, where names are the only thing that resembles the original stories. Roles, storyline, character have been slaughtered beyond recognition. It feels like I haven't even scratched the surface of how much I loathe this movie, for me it felt flat at every corner."

        "review_detailed_main": "TL:DR version; f#$% this movie. Watch Ghosts Of Sherwood instead, or the BBC Robin Hood series - either one of those absolute turkeys would still far and away be a better experience than this.\n\nFor more details; This is my first-ever 1-star review. I usually only ever review films I was impressed by, but that are a little left of centre and so I feel *deserve* a review, and potential viewers might actually *need* one on order to gauge its suitability to their taste. I am making an exception for Robin Hood, because it's just that awful that I feel the need, in this case, to actively warn others away. Hold onto your hats, because this is going to get mean.\n\nLast night I saw this film and with full knowledge of how hysterical this sounds, I don't think I have ever hated anything in my life quite so much quite so quickly. Not a person. Not a politician. Nothing has made me quite so *intensely* embittered, in quite so brief a span of time, as this film. My friend and I were stopping it every 10 - 15 minutes for 5-minute rants, so loudly and emphatically that my husband heard us, several rooms away, and emerged to hang out in the doorway to the living room and cack himself laughing, listening to us go. It certainly made the movie effectively longer, but those frequent rage-breathers were the only thing that made it possible to get through at all. It's atrocious.\n\nThe sole bright spot in the whole damn mess is Aussie national treasure Ben Mendelsohn working like the rent is due tomorrow, but much like fellow candles in the wind Charlize Theron in Snow White And The Huntsman and Jude Law in King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword (both far better movies, which should give you perspective), it's not enough. It could *never* be enough. And I am not personally a movie-snob, either! Generally, I'll cut a big-budget adventure film a break if it's dumb silly *fun*. I quite *like* dumb silly fun. But it needs to be...you know, *fun*. As in, enjoyable.\n\nMaking less than three quarters of its budget back in the worldwide gross, this film was apparently dollar-for-dollar the single biggest cinematic flop of last year, and the entire first page of user reviews on this site are 1-star, (even from viewers whose other reviews - you call it stalking, I call it research - consistently suggest they favour fairly undemanding entertainment). And I can see why. I actively wish I hadn't watched this. Now, I would certainly hope that no-one went into this film expecting historical accuracy - the Robin Hood legend was a fantasy in the first place, after all, let alone this awkward reinterpretation - but dear reader, there are *limits*. Not only was every single element *so* under-researched that it felt actively apathetic, from the politics to the social landscape to the costumes to the geography (\"Nottingham off the starboard bow!\" - ship, coming from the Holy Land), as well as geo-politically tone deaf in its hamfisted swings at modern allegory, but it also zigzagged so hard on several core parts of its paradigm (it had a *particularly* schizophrenic relationship with religion) and atmosphere, that it feels like the writing team couldn't really agree on what they wanted it to be and so eventually just compromised on a plan to draw scene numbers out of a hat and each get to write their one individually, then just combine them, blind, with zero review. Seriously, how did it even get *made*?! Who the Hell greenlit this?! Someone's head would have needed to roll, in the shakedown. It seems like a career-ender.\n\nThis film is not just awful, it's not just terrible, it's *horrible*. Watching it straight-p p%^&ed me off. I mean it. I'm not being hyperbolic with my emotionalism of emphasis, throughout this review, and I'm not being exaggeratedly mean just because it's fun to go all storm and fury on something, once in a while; I am 100% sincere in saying that I think it may actually be the new rock-bottom hat-wearer for the single worst film I have ever had the bad judgement to give a chance to. Genuinely. I would rather see Tales Of An Ancient Empire all the way to the end, or Southland Tales half a dozen times consecutively, or The Room every weeknight for a month, than to have to sit through even half of this again.\n\nI really feel for the crew who made this movie, because I am fairly certain that for many of them, it will be a stain on their resume which will dog their professional path in limiting and unfair ways. Being associated with this project will *cost* people.\n\nTaste in cinema is very individual, but by every standard - technical, narrative, world-building, research, costuming, set-dressing, and every other - this is a mess. It's hot, wet, garbage on fire. To like it would be to be objectively wrong. Take a hard pass."

But the accuracy bar on Robin Hood movies was destroyed by the Higgins' boats (circa 1944) in the Russell Crowe fiasco. The message is a fine balance between anti-war and the usual miscellaneous woke sentiments, but, overall, the agenda is more of a sprinkled seasoning than the main meal. The writing is adequate, the production is very high quality, and the acting is near the quality of the production. I mean, really, Jamie Foxx has a screen presence that rivals the best of the best, but he doesn't have to carry the movie. Remember Prince of Thieves? The most excellent movie ever made...except for the lead actor, Kevin Costner, who turned in a half hearted depiction of a MAN WITHOUT AN ACCENT. For un-obvious reasons, there has never been a perfect RH movie. But the imdb average of 5.3 is not fair. It is on the verge of shocking."

        "review_detailed_main": "I never thought I'd find it so hard to review a film. Especially when it's simply a 'modern retelling of the Robin Hood tale.' I know every old myth and legend is currently being reworked by Hollywood and most of them seem to fall flat due to people simply being so familiar with the story that they can't be bothered to watch it again, or young enough to only really care about superhero films.\n\nI'd recently watched the (latest) 'King Arthur' film which was also a modern retelling of the old legend. The critics hated it. Audiences didn't support it. And I've completely forgotten it. Therefore, because it was released at a similar time as 'Robin Hood' both films got lumped together.\n\nWhen I first started watching 'Robin Hood' I have to say that I didn't like it much. I checked how long it was (nearly two hours) and felt that I was probably going to turn it off long before the end. It was just weird. It played out like a war movie, but with people using bows and arrows. Then there were Matrix-like fight scenes and characters who you would never think looked like what you'd imagine them to look like.\n\nHowever, after a while, I have to say the story grew on me. Yes, it's a completely new take on the legend, but seeing as Robin Hood wasn't a 'real' person, any artistic license can be taken with the source material and no one can really say it's that historically inaccurate. I read somewhere online that the costume designers were told to make all clothes one part historically accurate and one part futuristic. And I can sort of see what they meant by that. The film comes across like 'Lord of the Rings' meets 'Star Wars,' but with people firing arrows on horses.\n\nTaron Egerton plays 'Hood' himself and I do think that he was the glue that held everything together. He may be young and this film may not be the Box Office success that propels him to true A-list status, but if he can make something as divisive as 'Robin Hood' so enjoyable then I predict he'll go a long way. I was also surprised to see that the character 'Little John' was played by a man who looked a bit like Hollywood heavyweight, Jamie Foxx. I was even more surprised when I read in the credits that it really was Jamie Foxx! If you've seen anything else he's been in you know that he's always worth the money and he certainly went a long way to help the film flow. Despite Ben Mendelsohn being the Sheriff of Nottingham, he didn't seem to be given as much to work with as some of the other recent roles where he's been allowed to enjoy being evil. Every other character did what they needed to and the guy who played 'Fryer Tuck' seemed a little too 'comic relief' for my taste, but he wasn't in it that much.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I stuck with it. In the end I don't really see this as a film about the mythical thief who got famous for stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Instead, I just see this as an enjoyable action romp with undecipherable locations (certainly don't look like any part of Nottingham that I've ever seen!). Definitely better than the recent 'King Arthur,' but I doubt it will ever get the sequel it was clearly hoping for."

It has close to no historical basis, isn't at all realistic, and is full of laughable plot holes both small and large.\n\nRobin Hood is an excuse to mash together light romance and a little bit of comedy between strings of action sequences in a plot with clear-cut heroes and villains that requires zero thought and is totally predictable. Which is just awesome! It has very enjoyable action sequences, most of which are totally unrealistic, but made me smile and laugh and cheer on the hero - in a way, like Kingsman. I mean, I didn't think that was a 10/10 movie because it was realistic or deep.\n\nFor me, movies are an escape -- and although I enjoy the odd film that evokes critical thought, mostly, I just want to pay a few bucks and walk out happier than I went in, which this movie does a fine job of. I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the many negative reviews, because I would have otherwise passed on it, which would have been my loss.\n\nShort version... if you like action films and don't care about history or realism or a deep plot line, you'll probably enjoy Robin Hood. If you're looking for a thought-provoking Oscar winner, look elsewhere."

Not sure what this movie was trying to communicate because it never delivered. How does a sheriff invoke such cruelty to people who can leave anytime and not face taxes and harm. How does an American, a couple Irishmen and some Brits think their strikingly different accents could make this credible Why hasn't Robin been imprisoned for treason and is questioned for his unexplained riches. When did arrow shooting become so fast and accurate? Who gave the green light to spend 100 million dollars for this? Why can't Jamie Foxx put more effort into his Arabian accent? This movie once again shows how a certain part of the movie industry thinks that the public will digest and celebrate any foolishness thrown at them because of certain actors with more catch phrases than true dialogue. This movie is a trainwreck comprised of political over correctness and a true abandonment of history. Little John is now forever perceived as a person of color when the legend never intended him to be. Morgan Freeman first played the character as a Moor and now he will a standard because it works in this age. This is a true example of the rich stealing from the middle class by passing this off as a box office venue. The antagonistic sheriff is played by an actor who can do a convincing American, British or Australian accent with ease, yet it seems the director just doesn't care how they sounded because we would be too dumb to care. The three built prop sets for this movie became too familiar and clostraphobic for me to the point I yearned for fresh air. Don't waste hard earned money for this drool. Looked like my 5 year old grandchildren playing good against evil games in the yard."

He was good in Kingsman, he was excellent as Eddie the Eagle, and he now stars in the latest version of Robin Hood. This version comes at the much loved and much represented folklore character from an alternative direction. Watching this film I felt I was part in history and part in current times. The costumes would not have been out of place on the High Street, and the set although very Hollywood, was gritty and well suited to the plot. This latest episode of the popular story tackled things from a different angle. Robin does not have a 'band of merry outlaws' and we get an explanation of the history of Robin's time in the crusades. Each individual character is shown very differently from the usual stereotypical image that we are used to. The Sheriff of Nottingham would not have been out of place in The Matrix, and although very much made to find its niche on the silver screen, this latest version of one of my favourite film characters is refreshing and quite exciting to watch. With Jamie Foxx as his trusted ally of course Robin manages to outwit all he comes up against, but beware this film does not always go in the direction you expect. It is very watchable, very compelling and I thoroughly recommend it."

For those who reported historical inaccuracies.... um, well spotted, though I think a better question is \"is there ANY historical accuracy in this film?\" to which I would answer: no. The creators have made a new universe, blending modern day military action with medieval weapons. They've intentionally thrown out a lot of the tradition to focus on creating a better ride for the audience.\n\nTim Minchin was the highlight here for me, showing off his comic timing, but this movie doesn't have career highlight performances from any of it's cast.- it doesn't give them the opportunity. This isn't a period drama. There is a lot of political correctness in it (which I never like to see in movies), but it's not trying to challenge the status-quo or say anything profound.\n\nTake the movie for what it is and you'll be laughing and cheering.

It is a war on all fronts, so that has to happen.\n\nJamie Foxx is great. And the humor subtle and appropriate.\n\nIt's a fun romp.

The problem is that massive egos take themselves too seriously and dispel the illusion for viewers. (2) The strong anti Christianity was laid on a little too heavily (and I say that as an atheist). The pro-Islam didn't help this at all (and some of my closest friends follow the Islamic faith and I respect their decision). (3) The trailer looked very politically correct and to be pro-antifa (antifa: violent thugs to attack anybody who gets in their way - including peace protesters holding peace signs ... and their violence is praised by the media). If you can look past these faults, the film isn't too bad. The action sequences are excellent. Most of the characters are likeable (save \"John\" played by Foxx who is far too fond of himself). The sets look excellent. The story has sufficient drama and investment in the characters. So ... in summary, this is a solid popcorn flick, far better than I expected. It's not great, however, I respect the attempt to be different and familiar with modern audiences at the same time."

Don't know why I bother reading movie Metascores and critic reviews as they often seem to harsh and out of touch with what I enjoy in a movie. That was definitely true of Robin Hood. It might not be an Academy Award winner, but it's worth the ticket price. There are plenty of fun and engaging action sequences that put prior Robin Hood renditions to shame. I also like the choice to expand Robin's story a bit which gives more context to his character. I expect to want to watch this again when it's available to rent, maybe more than once.\n\nP.S. Many reviewers have complained about the costume/set theme which is a bit dark and more reminiscent of fairytale than historical fact. (Similar to other films like Guy Richie's King Arthur.) You should get a good enough feel for this theme from the preview. If that's not your thing then this movie might not be for you."

The saddest thing is that it is because of such people good films like Robin Hood suffer. The audience was going to the cinema in expectation of disappointment. The Critic prepared the masses for the worst. When a person has too much power do not expect anything good. That is what this movie is about. It is about people who have the power to change something. Change your life, change someone else's life for better or for worse. The speech of Sheriff of Nottingham at the beginning of the film is absolutely identical with those that the president is currently feeding to my people. We are involved in a war with an enemy who used to be our brother. We are taught to hate other people who are different from us. And it's legal. After all, the government is rotting. Time passes, nothing changes. Only my love for Taron Egerton is changing. Now I adore him. All actors acted beautifully, the world of Robin Hood is interesting, and the music was fantastic. I am waiting for more movies like this one. Thanks to the creators for their work.

Men especially hate it .All their excuses are absurd and say more about them than the movie.Its a decent movie,right off the bat.I'm a woman so maybe i appreciated the movie more than men because Robin Hood is not just a brut with a sword? I dont mind Jamie Foxx in this movie ..he is supposed to be Moorish in this film which isnt unheard of in actual crusader times. Its not politically correct its simply factual. Trumpsters abound on these review boards...Robin Hood is a good movie..great sound,atmosphere and acting.This snt my opinion its fact.See for yourtself unless you hate diversity and men who can be both manly and tough but gentle and loving."

        "review_detailed_main": "It seems Hollywood cannot resist occasionally taking a legend, or actual history and making it a complete fantasy. This movie payed homage to neither the legend or the history. They even had some made up weaponry. It is the story Disneyfyed and about something that didn't happen, in a time that never was. Oh sure, they pretended that it was during the Crusades, but other than a few names and the basic idea behind the legend of Robin Hood, it most certainly wasn't a history that was real. In the end it was so bad I couldn't turn away. I kept asking myself why was I still watching? And the movie actually had some really good actors in it. F. Murray Abraham, Ben Mendolson are both top notch actors. And I just finished watching Black Bird and was impressed with Taron Egerton, and I also finished watching The Tourist on HBO and I liked Jamie Dornan. How they got a top notch cast to agree to such a stinker is beyond me, and then Leonardo Di Caprio is one of the producers. I guess talent can screw up occasionally no matter who they are. Just look at Sean Connery in First Knight."

If you look at it the way most people do.\n\nIt starts of with saying \"forget everything you know\" and you really have to do that or else it will be a horrable 2 hours. It's mot a classic tale. This isn't a Robin Hood like we know. It isn't a historicly correct movie. Not by a long shot. It isn't even set in a sertan time if you ask me.\n\nThe movie itself? It laks a lot. Dialogs aren't really good. The story is pretty thin and it's anything but realistic.\n\nSo what is it then? I will tell you. It's a nice and simple popcornmovie. It has explosions, it has action, it has some funny moments, actors that really like their roles and some beautiful wide area shots. And, although really thin and not always very logical, it has an ok storyline. A bit of The Green Arrow (tv show), meets Assassin's Creed, meets Fast and the Furious, meets the original Robin Hood, meets some other videogame or movie.\n\nProbable the best way to say it: if you are a regular 13 old boy you'll probably love it. Are you the seriously older brother, mom or dad, you will probably just shake your head. Or you will buy that large bag of popcorn, sit down, mind tot zero and have some fun like the 13 year old next to you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Robinhood was only a legend but he was English and it was supposedly the time of King Richard who ruled in the 12th Century. Ballads about Robin first appear in England in the 15th Century. Many enemies of English Kings were raiders in the forests and so there were no doubt many English Robinhoods.\n\nHowever there was never a black Moor. The Moors were loosely defined as Muslims in Spain who were Arabs. When the Muslims entered Europe for Jihad during the Crusades there was some blending with the Europeans. For those of you unfortunate enough to go through USA school systems during the past few decades, you may believe that blacks roamed Europe then, but they did not. That did not begin until the 1600's.\n\nThe mid-Atlantic slave trade began in the 15th Century but blacks were brought to the islands where sugar was booming and to the New World. Nubian Africans had made slaves of other Africans for thousands of years but the slaves who were purchased by the first European slavers were taken to the islands. The Europeans had been using white prisoners for that labor but they died too quickly because of white skin's vulnerability to sun exposure. So the growers tried African slaves usually captured by African tribes competing for the trade.\n\nThe Muslims had been raiding Nubian Africa and buying slaves for hundreds of years (from about 800 AD), but they were used for domestic services in Arab lands. There were no black Moors in Europe during the time of Robinhood and there was no Nubian Black Little John. It is like our new Black Western Cowboys and Mystical Kingdoms in Africa: Hollywood inventions.\n\nAccording to the last 100 years of Anthropology there are only three races: white, black and asian. The blends are referred to ethnicities and not more races. People trying to claim the Moors or Hispanics etc are part of a black racial group are doing it for political purposes to divide people. Native Americans were Asians. The Arabs all originally came from Europe. The migration of Europeans to South Asia and North Africa began about 20,000 years ago when we entered the warming period and the ice age was ending. That brought rains and bodies of water to the deserts so they could be cultivated.\n\nPeople from the South Asian and North African nations were all white such as the Egyptians, Jews, Sumerians, Pakistanis, Indians etc. We do not see black African DNA in the North African countries like Egypt until about 500 AD. And Nubian Blacks were not even a small part of European populations until the 16th Century when they were first brought there. So what this film is trying to do is alter the history and obliterate the facts for the purpose of lionizing and aggrandizing black people while eliminating the true heroes from the past.."

Btw after half an hour I was wondering just when exactly I was going to see the Greenwood. Never found out as I switched it off to rewatch something enjoyable. Hollywood please stop ruining classics (Richard Greene and Errol Flynn are rotating uncontrollably in their graves and justifiably so). Try and find something original that you can turn into a classic for future generations instead of disrespecting current generations with this garbage."

TOO RIGHT IT IS.\n\nAfter watching this, I got the feeling the studio was trying to setup a \"super-hero\" type franchise, and missed the mark a little. The setting of the movie is a little confusing. Feeling like a fantasy take on the Robin Hood story, which I can imagine put a load of people off. Really enjoyed the action scenes. Fast and well-paced, in my opinion. Ben Mendelsohn (Sheriff of Nottingham) must have had a lot of fun playing the role, trying to be the baddest of the bad. Why is he always cast as a villain? As is F. Murray Abraham as the Cardinal, who is corrupt to his very core. Jamie Dornan (Will Scarlet), Eve Hewson (Marian) and Jamie Foxx (Little John) were a little meh. But I did like Tim Minchin as Friar Tuck.\n\nTo enjoy this movie you have to go into it with the right frame of mind. In other words, disengage your brain and just view it as an adventure film, and nothing more. Go into it with the mindset of Brendan Fraser The Mummy, and you'll be fine. It's not as bad as people say it is. Just don't expect it to be a classic take on the Robin Hood story."

Unfortunately the attempt to make it modern and quirky with costumes is REALLY stupid. doesn't work. it pulls you out of the story constantly. There is zero suspension of belief. previous versions have gotten away with some historical inaccuracy by having a strong story, accurate costumes, period style filming and gravitas on camera. This movie has none of that. Not even Mendo could save this. Sorry Mendo x"

To enjoy it, you must keep an open mind. The acting is good, though some lines are slightly cheesy but forgivable. The action is also enjoyable for a Saturday night movie.\n\nAll in all, this movie may not be a blockbuster but it's enjoyable enough as an action movie with likeable characters and some cheesy scripts."

Between the holloywood red carpet type outfuts during the ball, including stileto heels and mink coats, or the medievil peasantry wearing modern overalls and proper leather safy boots in the mines or there wives and gf's wearing fitted leather coats, I couldn't tell what century let alone which film they was in! and lets not forget red and blue died wool and cotton which apart fro being hundreds of years to early would make them richer than the sherif to begin with, which judging by the stupid amount of gold and and silver trays and goblets, jewel knecklaces and other treasures the sherif was continuesly taxing the \"peasants / prisoners\" for i guess they must of been. Everythong about this film was either inacurate, or just plane old hollywood BS, this is all i really come to expect from hollywood, giant explosions and large fight scenes?!\n\nin short Robin Hood is pretty much like there current presidant D.Trump little more than a polished turd!"

So I'm a big fan. When I first saw the movie it was just one big WTF mess and I tought I would never like it. But when I watched all behind the scenes material and saw the training the lead actor went through to get the archery skills for the filming, I decided to give it another try. I saw it 2 more times and now I actually do like it.\n\nIf you like the traditional standarized stories, this is not the movie for you. If you however like new twists with new scenery and a more retrofuturistic take on the old tale, this might be the one for you. The lead actor is a great fit. Support anctors as well, although the could have polished their acting a bit more and let the movie be a bit more polished before release.\n\nWhat I think is that most people connect Robin Hood with the old versions and should be like that. I think this movie is bold and it dares to show Robin in a new way with more badass archery skills than the older versions. It's not the best movie, but good enough to season over time and eventually be liked by many. It's far more better than the king arthur movie. And far more better acting.\n\nIt's a okay movie that will become better if you allow it. For my part I am training to become more like this robin hood with my archery skills"

Now I know it's not the most historically accurate movie ever. But aside from that, I found the action, the acting, and the cinematography to be kind of okay and disposable. Where it's lacking for me however is in its story and characters. I like that they got Jon Ben Mendelsohn (A.K.A. Director Krennic from \"Rogue One\") as the main bad guy, but he's really only the truly memorable part about \"Robin Hood\". Again, the action is okay. It's not nearly as bad as \"Assassin's Creed\" with that film's fight choreography, but it's not as well choreographed as a lot of other films.\n\nAt it's best, it's a fun period action flick. At it's worst, however, it's story, characters, and writing are somewhat lacking. I think it's safe to call \"Robin Hood\" a popcorn film."

The cars were replaced with wagons and the motorcycles with horses. Oh, all chase scenes have to have a rooftop component which they had. Positive: Foxx always has this very characteristic way of looking down - like at the edge of the Grand Canyon."

        "review_title": "One Long Goof from Beginning to End",
        "review_detailed_main": "Like 2017's \"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword\", this version of \"Robin Hood\" takes an old British legend and transfers it to a bizarre fantasy world which bears little resemblance to its traditional mediaeval setting. Robin here becomes Robin of Loxley, a young aristocrat who is drafted into the army to fight in the Third Crusade against the Saracens. Upon returning to Nottingham after his military service, Robin discovers that his land and wealth have been confiscated by the corrupt Sheriff of Nottingham and launches a two-man campaign against the Sheriff's regime, hoping to inspire a rebellion against the common people. As in \"Robin Hood- Prince of Thieves\" the Sheriff is Robin's main antagonist; Prince John does not appear, and neither does King Richard, although vague references are made to a King in London. Robin's sole ally in his war against the System is Little John, in this version a Saracen who has followed him home from the Crusades. Maid Marian appears as Robin's girlfriend, and he has a friend called Friar Tuck, but other characters from the legend are absent. (There is a character named Will, but he has little in common with the traditional Will Scarlett).\n\nTaron Egerton makes a dull and uncharismatic hero, never looking able to fill the shoes of more illustrious predecessors in the role such as Richard Greene, Patrick Bergin, Kevin Costner or Russell Crowe. As for Errol Flynn, the two do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. Egerton plays Robin with a Cockney accent, appropriate neither to his East Midlands geographical roots nor to his supposed aristocratic status. None of his co- stars are any better; Jamie Foxx, who can be a fine actor, must regret signing on for this. Tim Minchin's Friar Tuck bears no resemblance to the fat, jovial character of legend. More like an inferior copy of Tony Robinson's Baldrick from \"Blackadder\".\n\nFinding goofs in this film would be as easy as shooting fish in a barrel. No mediaeval nobleman would have served as a common solider; they were automatically the \"officer class\" of their day. Crusaders would have worn armour as protection against the arrows of the enemy. Mediaeval Nottingham did not have a cathedral- the current Nottingham Cathedral only dates from 1841- and most of its houses would have been built of wood, not stone as shown here. The Sheriff condemns the people of Nottingham to work in the local coal mines, but before the Industrial Revolution coal mining was a relatively small-scale activity as most people relied upon wood or charcoal for fuel. Mines of the type shown here did not exist until the 19th century.\n\nAnd so on. You could say that the film is virtually one long goof from beginning to end. Its defenders (if it has any) might try and point out that errors of this sort do not really matter because the point of the script is to try and make connections between the traditional legend and present-day concerns. The Crusade is presented as the equivalent of the contemporary Iraq War, only fought with bows and arrows rather than guns. (The soldiers are stripped of their armour to make them look more like modern squaddies). The Sheriff is portrayed by Ben Mendelsohn as a rabble-rousing, Muslim-hating demagogue. Will is a politician of another stamp, a left-wing populist who drifts gradually rightwards until he becomes almost indistinguishable from the Establishment he once opposed.\n\nThe film has a pronounced anti-Christian agenda in that the corrupt Sheriff is in league with an equally corrupt Church, headed by a sinister Cardinal. Yet, remarkably, it also manages to be as offensive to atheists and Muslims as it is to Christians. Although the Sheriff relies upon the Church for support, he himself is a cynical and amoral unbeliever. We learn that he and the Cardinal are secretly in league with the Muslim leaders in Arabia to achieve some evil purpose, the details of which are never made clear.\n\nThe problem is that this sort of thing is very difficult to bring off. The film-makers seem to be totally lacking in any sense of history. Earlier versions of the legend, such as the splendid \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" from 1938, may have contained occasional errors of fact, but at least their makers were quite consciously trying to film a traditional legend on its own terms, which the makers of this film never try to do. The 2018 \"Robin Hood\" is by far the worst version of the story I have come across, inferior not only to \"The Adventures...\" but also the Bergin, Costner and Crowe versions and even the very disappointing \"Robin and Marian\" from 1976.\n\nAs with \"Legend of the Sword\", this film appears to have been envisaged as the first in a series. The ending certainly seems to be pointing to the possibility of a sequel. The lack of critical and commercial success enjoyed by both films, however, makes it very doubtful if any sequels will ever be made to either. 2/10"

There was modern mixed with old with the clothing, hairstyles etc. But it was clearly a re-telling/imagining from the start. I think it was in the name, people are very protective over Robin hood and had it been called something else with characters with different names then all these 1 star reviews would be very different. I believe in these modern times we are spoiled with movies and have become overly critical and overly sensitive at times when if we would allow ourselves to relax and have fun it would be much more enjoyable.

And it's a bad combination in my opinion.\n\nThe action scenes and military tactics are out of place (imagine a modern spec ops team but with bows and arrows), the wardrobe looks like it was taken from the Hunger Games (do please notice the modern suit, shirts and coat that are used...) and in the middle of what wath is called the Middle Ages everything is cleaner than a New York street... it's amazing the level of laziness of not caring for details in this movie .\n\nAs for the plot or story is just another adaptation. Can't really comment on that since is just another variation of the fictional character.\n\nIn short, if you are looking for a good movie this is not... it could have been. (And since it's so stupid to see modern style clothes and interactions in this movie that with some tweaks this could have been a decent parody)"

After four years away from England, Robin becomes disillusioned with the Crusades when he fails to prevent his commander, Guy of Gisbourne, from executing prisoners, namely a teenage boy, despite the pleading of the boy's father, which prompts Gisbourne to send Robin back home. When he returns to Nottingham, Robin learns from his old friend Friar Tuck that the Sheriff had him officially declared dead two years prior in order to seize Robin's land and wealth to continue funding the war effort at the behest of the corrupt Cardinal, kicking the citizens from the city and into the coal mine town across the river. Investigating 'the Slags', Robin witnesses the commoners planning to rise against the government that oppresses and exploits them and learns that Marian is now involved with their aspiring leader, Will Tillman. Robin is prevented from making contact with her by the Arab whose son he tried to save. The man introduces himself as Yahya - which he says can be translated to \"John\" - and proposes that he and Robin work to end the war by stealing the money taken from the people to fund the church's war. Marian seeks Robin upon learning that he is alive, but he chooses not to tell her of his plans for her own protection.."

All of the people living in the city have been exiled across the river to the coal mines....

I really like the longbow action, and I wish there was more, but everyone seams a bit out of place and the dark sets really look like, well movie sets. The story is full of clich\u00e9s, and one-liners and Robin Hood looks like he walked out of the Assassin's Creed's movie.

Taron Egerton (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Eddie The Eagle) proves to have reached his full status from rising star to full on movie star and for great reason as he is very talented. The brilliant Jamie Foxx is great as 'Little John' upholding the more emotional side of the story well aswell as contributing to the great chemistry between himself and Robin. There's also a particularly memorable performance by none other than Mr. Tim Minchin as Friar Tuck; great to see him on the big screen and hopefully this'll gain him more roles in further cinematic adventures! I think the absolute show stealer (same as Alan Rickman was in Prince of Thieves) was Ben Mendelsohn as the Sheriff Of Nottingham; genuinely scary in places, bitterly nasty dialogue and a monologue at one point that actually sent shivers down my spine. The story itself is fairly generic as we all know it now and it doesn't offer anything new to the table narratively but I think writers Ben Chandler and David James Kelly add enough zip and zang to the scenery-chewing dialogue that ups the entertainment value for sure! Although it is perhaps a bit too self-aware in that it forcefully builds itself up for a sequel towards the end, that is a minor quibble as the rest of the film is certainly worth a watch"

One more point and I'm not sure that others know(It's not really a big deal so skip if you chop to do) I notice a lot of makeup mistakes during \"Battle or fight scenes\" for a example one of the main characters just finished fighting in one scene, that scene shows the character face, in his face he had a bruise in his forehead and blood in one of his cheeks , the character was walking then it cuts back to his face than you see the bruise mysteriously heal up in a couple seconds and the blood from his cheeks were gone. I understand about the blood you wipe out the blood but how can heal a bruise in seconds? There's a lot of mistakes like that during the movie, it doesn't really affect the movie I'm just pointing it out. The movie wasn't bad but it wasn't great in my opinion, I think the movie could've been better it the storyline was better and more background stories from the characters. 6/10 -Unknown P.S. My opinion if you like the movie that's great"

This is an good example of an movie who totally ignore history, the movie don't even seem to care a little bit. There is very few even good historical movies that don't spit right in to the face of an history lover, for some reason it is hard to make movies that does not insult ones intelligence. For me it is obvious that when a movie are played out in historical time it should give the feeling of reality, so therefore it must be realistic. But this movie just gives the middle finger and just does it's thing, I know Robin Hood is an fictional character and story but that does not make it right. This is literally the bottom of the barrel for me, there is something wrong with the movie industry when an over 50 year old Disney adaptation are showing more respect to the original story and being historical correct. To this day, Disney's version are probably the one \u00b4that are most accurate. What does it try to be? similar to A Knight's Tale? That movie are in it's own way an abomination against history but it works, and why?, it is an damn comedy, an satire over the time period, then it works. If you make an movie that wants it's audience to take it seriously then you try to make it look authentic. Even Monty Python and the Holy Grail are mor authentic than this, come on. Let this movie go to history as an example how you DON'T make an movie played out in historical time if it is NOT an comedy. I hope the people behind this piece of filth are getting what they deserves and never ever tries to do something similar again. How this even could have been green lighted, I am speechless."

        "review_detailed_main": "Contrary to the Featured Reviews, Robin Hood (2018) met all the expectations of a good solid action movie as designed. For so many viewers to hit this movie with a 5/10 star rating or lower, especially a one star rating, is an absolute injustice.\n\nRobin Hood (2018) carries with an entry marred by traumatic events in his life that catalyze his transition into becoming Robin Hood in the typical and universally understood sense that he steals money from the rich and gives to the poor, succeeding of course to make the people whole again.\n\nI largely suspect the low reviews on this movie are based on the slight to significant deviation from the novel aspects of Robin Hood and the Robin Hood film predecessors. As Robin Hood (2018) rather deviates from those (I have yet to watch any preceding films on Robin Hood nor read the book), I attest that this film shall not be bashed on such relativity alone. When judged independently from any point of bias and point of reference in regards to an earlier established story and plot of Robin Hood, it has all the features of a classic, joyful, and partly suspenseful action series movie. When based on the heavy bias of the novel Robin Hood or of film, one may feel betrayed by the events outlaid in this film but the viewer must understand that the lore of Robin Hood is not firmly developed as there are many various accounts of the initial status and methods upon which Robin Hood engaged to help the poor. While there is little reference to nor inclusion the King (King Richard) in this film, it's preclusion does not warrant a poor rating.\n\nA movie that deserves a one star rating is Mummy Reborn (2019). A one star movie makes a harsh cut between one scene to another without a proper transition, has horrific on-screen acting, has an illogical plot and sequence, and overall has low-quality effects and efforts that make the movie unwatchable. In the Mummy, I had to break off on numerous occasions because of the poor quality of the film. I had only watched it because it fell in line with the series of Mummy movies which had so far been of timeless enjoyment. Robin Hood (2018) has a simplistic yet creative plot and logical sequence of events that are a hallmark of any good action movie.\n\nRobin Hood (2018) is well worth a watch! It might sound cliche to assert, but if you liked movies such as Speed (1994) and 300 (2006), you will absolutely enjoy this film (especially if you do not give bias to your historical accounts of Robin Hood)."

Easy story line to follow and good effects - the bottle of wine I drank whilst viewing may have clouded my judgment , but I really did think it was pretty good!"

Another \"social justice\" attempt to rewrite the history of the time. I understand this is fiction, but the attempt to change perception is almost criminal. I'm just so tired of Hollywood and thier agenda. This movie had a great cast but was sadly just pandering to victem hood."

        "review_detailed_main": "A schizophrenic movie which takes its story from Batman Begins, its combat scenes from current day war movies (squads, snipers, machine guns and RPGs included) and its wardrobe from anything historically accurate to shiny futuristic suits that could have come straight from Minority Report. Of course no self-respecting action movie is complete without supposed seemingly \"random explosions\". The movie is full of hilarious gems like people pulling ropes jerkingly while whatever is lifted up moves smooth and steady, all within the same shot. Overall feeling: Its like watching a movie told through the eyes of a teen aged boy who plays video games way to much. A detriment to cinema."

Visual very similiar with King Arthur Legend of the Sword. And just like King Arthur, the critics hated this movie as well. I think people still not ready for this type of \"modern medieval\" visual."

Whoever wrote the script, whoever was in charge of the costumes, haircuts ought to be shot on the spot. This must be the worst movie of all times. Stupid from start till end. Fights with a bow that shoots faster than a machine gun....wtf? Why would somebody in his right mind spend 100m dollars, and rent out a beautiful old city like Dubrovnik for months to make such a dumb movie? The city can not be recognized and they could have made it in a studio (or making a cartoon) for 99% less money. A huge disappointment. If you want to see a dumb movie and be disappointed like me watch this one....."

        "review_detailed_main": "Why such good actors would want to put their name to this rubbish is beyond comprehension. The direction is a bland, predictable and and lacks any noteworthy scenes. Sure, if it works, it ain't stupid; but this just doesn't work. The \"modern day ancient britain\" just isn't cutting it, when you've got a cross between every century, from 1000 AD to the 1980s (one specific scene where you get a pair of white tennis socks making up 15% of the screen shot, along with a pair of dockers to compliment them....). The effects would've been cutting edge in 1995, but since it's released in 2018 one wonders why the CGI looks like something that could be done on a $1500 PC. Maybe, if the writing wasn't worse than a short story written by a 6th grader under threat of being grounded for a year, the movie could have been directed a bit better. But with a storyline that is as clich\u00e9 as a political speech; dialogue more cringy than Days of Our Lives; and a continuity in the scene development that would make a 4 year old on cocaine seem coherent, this is probably the worst movie of 2018 in proportion to it's budget (I'm sure there was some backyeard YouTube movies that had worse dialogue... well... sorta sure...)"

CGI missed me in some places. For the the most part, I'm tired of watching reboots that mirror the originals. This is a reboot on the classic Robin Hood. If you're not one of those people who needs a story to mirror itself again and again, give this movie a shot. It's not perfect but it is entertaining and I really liked it."
