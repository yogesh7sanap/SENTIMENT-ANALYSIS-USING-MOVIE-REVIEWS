        "review_detailed_main": "You would think with all the accumulated earnings the Wayans brothers, Shawn and Marlon, have obtained after being on Television and in films for years that they would invest their money and their time in projects that would be a bit more thoughtful and entertaining. Instead, ever since the runaway success of \"A Haunted House\" in 2013, the two, particularly Marlon, have been keen on making movies that fit the bill for the lowest common denominator of entertainment. \"Fifty Shades of Black,\" a horribly obvious and persistently unfunny array of cheapshots at the erotic novel/film series that is already too easy to joke about, continues Marlon's streak and incredible failing to make something out of his Baby Way Productions company.\n\nI've always found it interesting that while Tyler Perry's films are anything but consistent, and there are about an equal number of bad films in his catalog as good films, he often gets blamed for making films about black people that cater to the lowest common denominator and showcase them in a negative light, yet the recent collaborations of Marlon Wayans and Michael Tiddes go pretty much unscathed. These are films that evoke some of the most putrid and ugly stereotypes about nearly every race and, for that matter, exist simply as unapologetically crude and contrived projects that do nothing but attempt to evoke laughs based on brand-recognition. These films are just a slight notch above the dreaded works of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.\n\nAs hinted, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is a parody of \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" and it takes pretty much the safest, most convenient route to parody the film by making the jokes largely centered around the absurdity of BDSM and its culture, race and ethnic humor, the ordinariness and \"ugliness\" of its lead female character, and the enigma surrounding its titular character, who in this case, is Christian Black (Marlon Wayans). Christian is a multi-millionaire mogul who begins a sexual relationship with his new intern, Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk) and what entails is a relationship filled with sex, sexual violence, and downright bizarre encounters.\n\nWhile whatever Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison gang is cooking up this year is likely to get plenty of Razzie nominations, Marlon Wayans and his cast of familiar faces such as Affion Crockett, Missi Pyle, Mike Epps, Fred Willard, and more should be looking at the same award. It's incredibly rare to see a cast ostensibly operate on auto-pilot and look like the end product bearing some essence of quality is the furthest thing from their minds, but perhaps given the lazy screen writing of Rick Alvarez and Wayans himself, this was to be expected.\n\nShockingly enough, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" offers more laughs than both of the \"Haunted House\" films put together, especially during a sequence that parodies one of last year's Best Picture contenders at the Academy Awards. However, in order to get to this sequence, one has to succumb to the drudgery of enough racial and bathroom humor - so much that it gives Laura Mulvey's concept of \"phallocentrism\" a whole different angle to explore - that it ultimately isn't worth sitting through the amount of trivial nonsense to get to that particular scene.\n\nWe're not even in February yet and this year has already been incredibly interesting for comedies. After seeing \"Ride Along 2,\" I didn't think many more comedies of the year would get much worse than that. Then I saw \"Dirty Grandpa\" the following week and I thought the same thing; there was most likely the weakest comedy of 2016 that I would have to sit through. Now, almost exactly a week later, I've seen \"Fifty Shades of Black,\" and if this isn't the worst comedy of 2016, I seriously fear what I have to endure in the coming eleven months."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me preface this by saying I have never seen 50 Shades of Grey. I've seen the reviews, I know the story, but after seeing 50 Shades of Black I feel like I've seen the actual movie it was parodying. Wayans' comedies have devolved from clever self-aware satires to blatant movie rip-offs with sporadic laughs. The difference is, unlike the Haunted House movies, there are next to no laughs in 50 Shades of Black. It's essentially deconstructing every scene in 50 Shades of Grey to show the audience how dumb it is, which would be fine if it was actually funny. But no, this humor is scraped right from the bottom of the barrel, reusing the same stupid gags from previous spoofs and rehashed awkward shock \"humor\" that comes across more cringe-worthy than anything.\n\nI like Marlon Wayans, I really do. He seems like an awesome guy and he was actually a great writer one point, and a great actor too (to this day I'm blown away by his performance in Requiem for a Dream), but his talents must have gone to his head because he isn't tapping into his genius anymore. It's just easy joke after easy joke, and as simple as the jokes are, none of them land. In fact, at one point after a painfully awkward dinner scene that went on 5 minutes too long, I couldn't help but laugh, for the wrong reasons mind you, thinking, \"Jesus Christ, this is a real movie?\" It was painful.\n\nAll of me wanted this movie to be good, but part of me knew it would be a disaster. Well, that part of me was right. Sure, I chuckled at a few scenes, but I also chuckled a few times in A Haunted House 2 and that's still a terrible movie. The difference is 50 Shades of Grey is even lazier and somehow even less clever than AHH2. I anxiously await the day the Wayans brothers come out with another great spoof movie, but I have a feeling it's going to be a long, long wait."

I was expecting 50 Shades Of Grey meets Scary Movie- you know, a parody that actually worked. But I couldn't have been more wrong. It was more 50 Shades Of Shite.\n\nFive minutes in to the film and I knew i'd spend the remaining 1 hour 27 minutes with my palm on my forehead, cringing for my life at it's stupidity.The film had potential to be very funny but the idea was crushed by the terrible acting, and pathetic excuse for dark humor. I can account for the two times, throughout the whole movie, I let out a slight giggle- well it was more of a scoff but at least it triggered some kind of emotion eh.\n\nAs a kid I loved the Haunted House and Marlon Wayans was brilliant in it; I think this is why I expected great things. I think he should stick to his PG rating films. It's crude sexual content contained stereotypical 'humor' that could be considered racist towards African American's and many people could take offence. I find it offensive that we are expected to pay as much as \u00a35 to watch this. Watching paint dry is more entertaining.\n\nI was counting down the painful minutes, praying for the movie to end. When it did, sheer disappointment and disgust was how I was left feeling about this movie. This film is a waste of time and a waste of a cinema slot."

The wife and I went to the theater expecting some lighthearted fun. But, what we saw was anything but fun or funny.\n\nThis film's attempts to parody the plot of Fifty Shades of Grey were overshadowed by the stilted dialogue, lame sight gags, and ineffectual attempts to get a rise out of the audience with tired racial stereotyping and racist humor. Sexual humor was expected. But I did expect some of it to be funny. It wasn't. Most of the gags in the film were greeted by dead silence in the theater and blank stares at the screen by my fellow theater goers.\n\nWe talked about walking out of the movie after the first scene, and every scene after that until we finally did walk out 20 minutes into the movie.\n\nMaybe there was a funny joke in that movie later on, but I am sure I will not be giving this movie a second chance. It is one of the worst movies I have even seen."

I probability would not care if the jokes were funny.

        "review_detailed_main": "It was only a matter of time that someone came along and spoofed the widely popular and highly alluring pop-culture phenomenon that was Fifty Shades of Grey. What isn't surprising is that spoof specialist and kinda, sorta washed up actor/writer Marlon Wayans was the one to do so. Wayans, whose previous parody films include A Haunted House 1 & 2, Dance Flick and Scary Movie 1-4 brings forth a very important question with his newest spoof feature Fifty Shades of Black; is the spoof film finally, officially dead?\n\nIts hard to believe but, after such classics as Airplane!, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and yes, even the original Scary Movie, the spoof film may slowly if not almost entirely die off and be resting in peace very soon.\n\nThe world currently is one that is obsessed with social media platforms and media within these social networks. Thanks to applications such as Vine, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube, it seems that audiences everywhere are capable of finding comedy and entertainment, not only within the comfort of their own homes, but as easily and accessibly, within moments, within the palms of their hand.\n\nWhen the dawn of the television was upon us, people everywhere thought that televisions were going to destroy Hollywood and the history of feature films altogether; it didn't. With the rise of the Internet and the quickly developing moment of streaming and illegally downloading films and music online, people soon thought that the future of movies and music was on its way on the decline. Yet, in 2015 no less, two of the highest grossing films of all-time were released, and more than ever, the profitability of music has never been better. So, how and why is the spoof film genre dying slowly but surely?\n\nThe thing about entertainment in 2016 is that, entertainment isn't merely measured but numbers and margins, but by memories and moments of experience and spectacle, with margins and numbers as well. Entertainment is constantly evolving, and the forms in which we consume entertainment maintains the ways in which we determine whether the entertainment itself is viable, or not. The thing with earlier spoof films like the ones that were mentioned above are, in order to consume such comedy, going to the movie theatres and watching it for yourself was the only way of consumption. Now a days, not only are films, genres and characters spoofed on the daily, but pop culture, with the help of social media, spoofs the crap out of anything and everything. Don't think thats the case? Think back, just in 2015, to all the spoofs you saw online about Adele's song Hello, Drake's music video to Hotline Bling, as well as anything else flooding the front pages of your vine, Instagram and Facebook news feeds.\n\nThe beauty behind the genius in the earlier spoof films of the 80's and 90's was that accessibility was limited and, these films weren't just spoofing a specific movie, having limited content to work with. Think of Austin Powers for example, it wasn't just a spoof on spy films and a filmography of more than a dozen Bond films at that time, but also a genre, the unbelievability of a lifestyle or profession little to nothing is known about, as well as providing a fantasy for the possibility of the many beauties the life of what an international person of mystery might really be like. Sure, Black may spoof Kim K for a second, the Weeknd here and there, but overall, these small and insignificant and highly forgettable inclusions did nothing to elevate the plot or humour of the film overall.\n\nIf you're wondering why I haven't really mentioned the plot line or story of Black, well, thats because the film is basically a shot-for-shot carbon copy of the original Grey film, with added crass and crude black jokes included, sexual innuendos juiced up to the max and of course, taking what the original did, and making it funny by stripping away its glamorous and polished exterior; essentially, making it real world scary for real life people. No matter how you look at it, regardless of how much money you have, any girl would be scared of having a wealthy man stalking you at work asking for ropes and zip-ties and what not.\n\nWhat I found super interesting with Black was how the film is slowly accepting and transitioning from movie stars, to social media stars starring within feature films. Sure we've seen Vine stars make cameos in films before, like Brittany Furland in last year's We Are Your Friends, but in Black, social media icon King Back/Andrew Bachelor has a very prominent role as the not so subtle yet totally obvious best friend Jesse that wants a piece, like any other straight male friend wants from their female friends. Bach represents not only a dominance of social media within feature films, but perhaps, the next phase and new generation of movies stars tomorrow. Plus, is it just me or does Bach remind anyone else of a younger Will Smith?\n\nSure Black states the obvious humours that we found in the original Grey film, but the beauty of Fifty Shades of Grey was that it knew that it was going to be the basis to much criticism, the butt end of endless jokes and spoof online for weeks and months after its release. Luckily for the film, made on only $40 million dollar, its return really laughed in all the faces of sceptics and all its negative criticism. Fifty Shades of Grey broke these records; highest grossing film directed by a woman, highest grossing February release and #1 President Day 4-Day Holiday Weekend (all of these numbers NOT adjusted for inflation). So I guess, the joke is on us, especially since they numbers and records are bound to be broken once the newest instalment of the series is released in 2017."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Wayans Family has created quite an entertainment dynasty over the past three decades or so. Long before anyone had heard of Tyler Perry, the Wayans Brothers, as most people refer to them, started creating big and small screen entertainment that catered to the African-American audience. The Wayans brought us the sketch comedy show \"In Living Color\" (1990-1994) which, in turn, helped launch the careers of Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx and David Alan Grier, among others, as well as films like \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\" (1988), \"Major Payne\" (1995) and the \"Scary Movie\" horror film parodies (2000-2013).\n\nThe Wayans are mostly known for their parodies. 2016 adds another one to the list with Marlon, the youngest of the original \"Wayans Brothers\", co-writing and starring in \"Fifty Shades of Black\" (R, 1:31). Most will immediately recognize that this film is a take-off on 2015's very successful film adaptation of the book \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". Like most of the Wayans' films, pop culture and movie references abound, but \"Fifty Shades of Black\" duplicates much of the plot of the film that inspired its comedy. You'll see what I mean in the following plot summary (which, by the way, is necessarily risqu\u00e9).\n\nHannah Steele (Kali Hawk) is an attractive and intelligent college senior in Washington State who fills in for her sick roommate, Kateesha (Jenny Zigrino) in interviewing billionaire business magnate Christian Black (Marlon Wayans) for the college newspaper. Hannah gets flustered in the presence of this sophisticated, supremely-confident and mysterious man. Christian is quite taken with Hannah \u2013 and take her is what he soon decides he wants to do. He shows up at the hardware store where she works, takes her out to coffee and even comes to \"rescue\" her when she drunk dials him from a bar. Despite how obvious it is to the main characters and to the audience that these two are very, very different \u2013 and despite the title character's own conflicted resistance \u2013 these two cannot resist each other. But Christian very clearly states, \"I don't do romance.\" That doesn't stop Hannah from being drawn to this man.\n\nAs Hannah discovers more about the cipher that is Christian, she learns that he is wounded \u2013 both emotionally and physically \u2013 by his childhood. She seems to want to comfort this man who acts as if he needs no comforting and begins to love this man who tells her that he is only interested in her for sex. Being the woman in Christian Black's life means submitting completely \u2013 sexually and otherwise \u2013 to his whims. As he eases her towards an understanding and acceptance of his lifestyle, she has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, he convinces her to have sex (actually \"f--- hard\", as he describes it) and then shows her his \"playroom.\" This usually locked room is painted dark red, has a bed and is filled with various restraining devices and implements of sadomasochistic sex play. Hannah is shocked, but not necessarily repulsed. Christian presents his contract which describes Hannah's role as his submissive.\n\nI just did something I've never done before (or even been remotely able to do) in a movie review. The previous two paragraphs are actually cut and pasted from my 2015 review of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\"! Using the \"find/replace\" function in Microsoft Word, I changed the names of the characters and the actors playing them to match those in \"Fifty Shades of Black\" and I shortened the summary, but I did not add or change anything else. (You can scroll down our timeline to my \"Grey\" review to see for yourself.) But rest assured there's plenty in \"Black\" besides just recreating and making fun of scenes from \"Grey\". \"Fifty Shades of Black\" also seamlessly incorporates Wayans-esque versions of scenes from such movies as \"Whiplash\" and \"Magic Mike\". There are also references to a plethora of other popular movies, TV shows and books, plus a generous helping of pop culture satire and some politics. This is the kind of film which is so fresh, it feels like it was written a month before its release, but that means that its humor (and perhaps its appeal) will quickly become dated. Of course, there's also plenty of racial humor, much of it stemming from white actors Jane Seymour and Fred Willard playing the title character's parents.\n\nLike much of the Wayans' work, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is very funny in spots, but those spots are small and spread out. The few clever/amusing jokes and sight gags and even fewer laugh-out-loud moments seem adrift in a sea of gross-out humor and over-the-top acting which is often not that funny. Still, most Wayans fans will probably enjoy the film and those who've only seen a little of their work may find this one good enough for a mild recommendation. \"B-\""

This overused genre consists of many movies currently on IMDB's Bottom 100 list....with the likes of \"Disaster Movie\" (#1), \"Epic Movie\" (#12), \"Date Movie\" (#24), \"Scary Movie V\" (#50), \"The Starving Games\" (#44) and \"Extreme Movie\" (#99). \"Fifty Shades of Black\", incidentally, is #65 on this infamous list of badness. Unlike other films in this god-awful genre, this film is a parody of another film on the infamous Bottom 100 list, the original \"Fifty Shades of Gray\" (#92).\n\nThis film is a bit different from the other crappy parodies I mentioned above. It is more a silly version of the original film and is NOT a parody of a dozen or more other films (which the above garbage films all are). Also, not surprisingly, it's MUCH more sexually-oriented...as \"Fifty Shades of Gray\" was a highly sexualized story. But this is much more crude than I even expected...and crude and unfunny scenes were piled on atop the other! It also has a lot of content that might make the more left-leaning audience members cringe or become furious. The leading man in this film is rich and successful like the one in the original story...BUT because he's black (Marlon Wayans), he says he made his fortune selling crack and sucking....well...IMDB won't let me say more about that. This is NOT the most positive and uplifting sort of black man, that's for sure!\n\nAs far as the story goes, it's terrible....so terrible I found I much preferred the original film...which I still strongly dislike. Yes, they managed to make a worse version of an already terrible movie! Offensive, brain-numbingly stupid, crude beyond belief, and, sadly, a film marketed mostly towards younger folks (whose growing brains really don't need this!). Currently, this film is #65 on the Bottom 100....I think that is way, way too generous...especially after seeing the Florence Henderson (I am NOT kidding) sex scene!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Fifty Shades of Black serves as the second Fifty Shades movie and the reality that these movies are still being made, even though the cast and crew knows that it sucks, but they don't care because they are just now have enough money to spend the year in Las Vegas. It's already starting to cause me even more pain.\n\nThis movie serves as a parody to Fifty Shades of Grey, but the bad thing about it is that it is not even funny or different from the same old toilet humour that is used so often in comedy movies nowadays. There was not one moment where I chuckled or even sniggered. I think I did laugh, but that might have been at the movie not with the awful clich\u00e9 jokes that I've already heard in these comedy movies.\n\nAnd it's such a shame to see a talented actor like Marlon Wayans, who before offered a fantastic turn with Requiem for a Dream and then made us chuckle with the first two Scary Movie films, and then to see that talent wasted in this abomination of a parody movie. I hate it when actors just become overpaid tools in movies that they know are bad but they are just in it for the money, when they know that they are better than that.\n\nThe thing is that Fifty Shades of Grey was anything but a good movie to start off with, so parodying a movie that is already bad doesn't make it any better or more enjoyable. I mean, this movie could've been funny in some places, but the dick and ball jokes that this movie overuses so many times just failed to hit.\n\nNot to mention it's out of place references to other movies, not just Fifty Shades of Grey, but you can tell from the poster that it's making those references just to try to be funnier, and to their credit, no, they failed.\n\nIf you watch one movie early this year, Fifty Shades of Black is definitely not worth recommending when you really should just buy another ticket for Deadpool.\n\nOverall rating 1/10."

Another painfully unfunny spoof that takes nearly all it's material from previously made content. That is the basic definition of Fifty Shades of Black. There was only one point during this film that I wanted to laugh but because of how bad the rest of the film was I couldn't. There are two main problems with this film. 1. The script is really, really awful and is not funny in any way and 2. Nobody in this film can act! Those are two vital things to make a comedy funny the acting and the script and if both of these fail then the film is just terrible, which is what this pile of trash is. All jokes are about Fifty Shades Of Grey and it's content and might as well be an adaptation of a joke book of painfully unfunny sex jokes. There are so many moments intended to make people laugh but just end up being horribly cringe worthy moments because of either what can be seen or just what is being said. There were points where people moaned in disgust at the goings on on screen and the majority of the film was spent in silence. In total two different people ,out of 13, laughed at two different points, 3 people walked out during the film because of how bad it was.Nearly all of the characters in the film are annoying and this is made even worse by the terrible acting. During the film Marlon Wayans character describes something as \"painfully uninteresting\" and something else as being written by someone in year 3. Fifty Shades of Black is painfully unfunny and boring and could have been written by a dirty minded 8 year old. But then again the 8 year old would have probably wrote something much more entertaining and funnier.\n\nIt isn't as bad as other parody films but Fifty Shades Of Black is still a seriously unfunny film and is definitely one of the worst films of 2016. ** <-- Two Stars"

This comedy spoof, ala, Wayans, almost outdoes itself, near up there on the comedy scale with films like Bruno. They'll be chuckles aloud, in continuity. And we know if the Wayans are involved, we're not gonna be disappointed, smart brothers who know comedy but smart comedy with some gags you never see coming. They have an original style of comedy that's always a winning formula. What this film does, is that is it surprisingly sticks to the story and scene structure as the other one, almost to the letter, with some cute changes, one I particularly liked. Here, this one really takes the p..s out of the 2015 bore snore. Exciting lead, Wayans, replaces our dull Dorman, really throwing spark into the role, in top gear as Christian Black, while this time, our English lit student/journo replacement/part time hardware shop worker, and ordinary, known as Hanna, not Anastasia Steele, is wonderfully played by Hawk. From comical whippings to dejected, non helicopter/jet rides, this Fifty Shades has it all. We have some really crude moments involving male anatomy, someone who's really well endowed, shall we say. Hanna Steele's more likable flatmate here, is a chubby Rebel Wilson type who craves sex and food, and food, and food. Again we have many movie references (something I'm not really impressed by) a bit too many here, with a little bit of Zero Dark Thirty and I Spit On Your Grave 3, thrown in as well, as well as the dropping of a famous Porky's (easy lay) character. A couple of surprising co stars show up in this, like a still radiant and refined, Jane Seymour, and shocking as it is surprising, a cameo by a much recently missed Brady. This one has better everything, better script, better acting, entertainment value and appeal, for a number of reasons, most of them, laughably related. Fifty Shade's haters will love this Fifty Shades, trust me. You want something done right, different and smart, get a Wayans to do it. Good show and well made pic too."

Well, I don't have something else to say about this movie, I've seen it almost half a year on 30 January when it first launched in Romania.

Micheal Tiddes, who also worked on \"A Haunted House.\" How is this guy such a success. His comedy is so out there and dull, and his parody style is so grotesque that I find it kind of insane that he is still around and making so much money off of people.

Really? This movie tried way too hard and Marlon Wayans was a huge over-actor, even more than usual. Parodies were a lot better in the eighties and nineties when you had Spy Hard and Spaceballs. Granted the Wayans had Don't be a Menace and Scary Movie but apparently it takes more than one Wayans to write a funny movie. He needs to stop flying solo. You had A haunted House now go back to your brothers! Frankly I'd rate this lower than a 1 if I could. The only thing I noticed is Marlon's definitely been working out and interestingly enough I think he would've been a cool addition to Magic Mike XXL. He would've added extra humor to the bunch. A role in that movie would've been a million times better than this 50 shades of crap."

My opinion of each of them has now seriously suffered.\n\nThe only other movie I've ever considered walking out of for all the same reasons was Borat, which was equally as bad.\n\nThere was only one moment in this entire movie that was actually funny, and that was seeing Christian grey, black, red, white, blue, etc. listed in Hannah's cell phone. The rest of the 'humor' was clearly aimed at the highly narrow demographic of 13-year-old boys. What a colossal disappointment."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Fifty Shades of Black\" (2016) is an entertaining film. The story is a direct parody of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" where college student, Hannah Steele played by Kali Hawk, falls for unorthodox billionaire, Christian Black played by Marlon Wayans, but his sexual practices put a strain on what could become a beautiful relationship. The story is there for what could have been a heavy dose of comedy, but it doesn't seem to mesh well as the film could have.\n\nThe director, Michael Tiddes known for over the top comedies like \"A Haunted House\" (2013), stayed true the style of comedy. Ever comedic take had funny laced in the dialogue or visuals and then amplified to drive it home. Occasionally it was a bit much. The music that filled most of the film was very intertwining and relatively spot on but, there were a few lapses in the sound department. Some of the voice-overs missed the mark and took away from the film. Overall, it was just OK but, still an enjoyably film."

Never since Birdman have I seen such a power-house of a film hilariously and truthfully mirroring Hollywood and the state it is in. By parodying Fifty Shades of Grey, one of the few masterpieces of 2015, not a year before it was made turns Hollywood's state of remakes on it's head. Marlon Wayans is fantastic, bringing his charisma, energy, and displaying the raw and powerful emotion we thought he had lost after Scary Movie 2. And how this film turned out to be the masterpiece of cinema it is is just an accomplishment. An insightful, hilarious and culturally sensitive film this is a special landmark and kicks off 2016 with art-house genius and style."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Fifty Shades of Black\" is a Parody - Comedy movie of the 2015 movie \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", in which we follow the same premise as \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", reimagines Christian Grey's character through the lens of comedy, but instead of clever wit, the film relies on exaggerated stereotypes and crude humor.\n\nI have to admit that I laughed a lot with this movie since I had already watched \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and I could make the connection. Unfortunately, the movie didn't deliver the kind of sharp humor or biting satire that could have made it memorable. In addition, the over-the-top romance, absurd and cringe moments didn't help the movie. The interpretation of Marlon Wayans who played as Christian Black was good since he brought his usual brand of slapstick comedy. While it may appeal to fans of Wayans' previous works, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" didn't offer something new. To sum up, I have to say that \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is a below the average movie and I am sure that even the fans of Wayans would be disappointed."

Since I didn't see it and have no intentions of seeing it I figured watching this would clue me in while giving me a laugh or two. I got a few chuckles though nothing gut-busting. Marlon is still raunchy and crass. Sometimes it works but most times it doesn't.\n\nBe prepared for PLENTY of sexual humor and a loose story that allows some shots to be fired at other movies and other celebrities. It's not cleverly done, but most Wayans movies aren't. You may laugh or you may cut it off after the first scene."

But please quit writing all of these negative and extremely discouraging reviews if you are not even into this sort of movies and humor!\n\nNote: you will only like this movie is you have watched the original!\n\nI watched this movie with my sister on an ordinary night when we had nothing better to do. None of us had seen it nor seen the trailer or read the reviews. I normally always look up every movie on IMDb before watching it, but in this case I am glad I didn't. I had heard from one of my friends that it was hilarious and also I had heard one of my other friends that it wasn't funny at all. So 50/50 chance, I thought.... Please understand that it's not uncommon for movies who aim to make people laugh to have low ratings. It is simply because not everybody is into that kind of humor. It's like when people who hate horror movies watch a horror movie and then make a review on it.\n\nMy sister and me happen not to like the original \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and maybe that is one of the reasons why we found this movie so funny. It was very obvious to us that they were just making one big joke out of everything. Everything was very exaggerated which we thought was extremely funny. They have done a very good job in taking small details from the original movie and turning it into something funny and crazy - again please keep in mind that it's a parody and meant to be a little too much!\n\nThis humor was so stupid that we just had to laugh uncontrollably throughout the whole movie. But again, I am not very fond of the original and therefore I maybe sympathize more with its opponent. But really. It's so funny. Just make sure to watch it in good company and to have no expectations. Btw if you loved the original one you might get offended by this movie."

OK. what else can i say about this movie that the 5 previous lines didn't say? marlon wore great suits and i liked the apartment's decor. the female lead tried too hard to be serious/funny, but i never read the books nor did i see the movie of fifty shades of gray, so i don't know if the female lead was like this, but being a parody, i assume she was. oh, i almost forgot, the supporting female was the best character in the entire movie and i wish she had a bigger role. i got my laughs mainly from her, but some may think otherwise, but it is a parody after all; you have to take the good with the bad. OK, i should be at 10 lines now. :)"

Marlon has evolved from this style of parody comedy. He has evolved as a comedian, actor and a man in general.

So if you are a big fan of the numerous other Wayans spoofs, then chances are very high that you will enjoy this one too. But personally, then I think that formula has been worn down to the bone and it is time for Wayans to go back to the creative corner and come up with something new.\n\nThe end result that is \"Fifty Shades of Black\" turned out to be not particularly funny. Sure, there were some good laughs here and there throughout the course of the movie, because of the jokes or the situations. But in overall, then this was a very generic and flaccid movie, which could have been a lot more funnier with some more creative and original writing.\n\nI will actually go as far as saying that if you have seen any one of the many previous Wayans spoofs, then you have essentially also already seen \"Fifty Shades of Black\".\n\nNow, I haven't seen the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" movie, nor read the book, and I have no intention to do so. So how much or how little \"Fifty Shades of Black\" stays true to the original source material.\n\nHowever, all in all, then \"Fifty Shades of Black\" was just another generic spoof comedy that failed to stand out or leave any real lasting impression."

Unlike the last few movies they have done though this one is more of a mock then a spoof, in the vein of Hot Shots. Rather then just piecing together parts of different movies to try and be funny, this one sticks to the Fifty Shades of Grey story and really just takes it in a more ridiculous direction. There were a few parts where I smiled and even a few where I laughed out loud, but there are still scenes in this that go on way too long with a joke that isn't funny to start with. Many people may like this one, but as for me it just felt forced and tried too hard to be funny, and failed. Overall, another Wayans' spoof that falls flat. I give this a C-."

The film was directed by Michael Tiddes, and written by Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez; the same trio performed the same duties on both 'A HAUNTED HOUSE' movies (which are parodies of the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' flicks). Wayans also stars in the film, as Christian Black; a rich entrepreneur with an obsession for stalking and beating young women. Kali Hawk costars, as the virgin college student he's pursuing. The movie also features Jane Seymour, Fred Willard and Florence Henderson in supporting roles. It's about as bad as you'd expect it to be, with just a few funny moments mixed in.\n\nChristian Black (Wayans) is a wealthy businessman; who made most of his money through stealing from others (and a brief job as a male stripper). He's obsessed with stalking and domineering young women (and he already has four restraining orders against him). So when a young virgin college student, named Hannah Steale (Hawk), comes to his office to interview him, for her roommate's school paper, he immediately becomes infatuated with her. A very unhealthy relationship develops.\n\nThe movie is almost as painfully bad, and crude and offensive, as the material it's parodying. Almost, but not quite. It's not as offensive as 'FIFTY SHADES OF GREY', because it's main intent is just to spoof that film; it's a joke, and not supposed to be taken seriously. Parts of it are funny, because the film it's spoofing is so easy to make fun of, but it's definitely not clever or witty in any way. Overall it's a waste of time, and pretty hard to sit though.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHm0V1TOCkg"

Since the film failed to make me laugh once, I could still see some good in the writing. It's the delivery by Marlon Wayans and Kali Hawk that fail. Kateesha was especially annoying.\n\nAffion Crockett reminds me how much distaste I have for The Weeknd and his mediocre singing (insert Mad Max reference)\n\nMarlon Wayan's goofy humor was off-putting this time around. I've enjoyed his earlier work, Scary Movie, and even more recent ones like, A Haunted House.\n\nSomething nice to say about Kali Hawk is that she took this roll like a boss. She seemed to genuinely try to keep in character and play along with the goofy nature of the film.\n\nVerdict: You were right not to go see this movie. Don't bother renting it now.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Fifty Shades of Black\" satisfies my primary criterion for comedies: Did it make me laugh? It did.\n\nI haven't seen \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" so don't know which parts were parodies or how effectively the movie lampooned its inspirational material. Some of the gags fell flat, others seemed poorly executed, but many made me laugh out loud. The humor isn't politically correct in the least, but I consider rectitude the antithesis of comedy. Much of the humor involves racial stereotypes, but rather than being mean spirited toward minorities, it often ridicules the ignorance of bigots. The sexual content, as well as the sadomasochistic elements were low key and conservative, despite the R-rating in part for \"some graphic nudity,\" which comprised obviously prosthetic phalli and scrota, and one left breast that looked better than real.\n\nProduction values were more than adequate with a refreshing lack of distracting camera jitter. Performances were solid throughout, with all the actors committed to roles that weren't always flattering. Kudos to Jane Seymour and Florence Henderson for their unabashed performances, as well as to the rest of the cast. None of the actors seemed self-conscious in the least.\n\nMy chief reservation is that they didn't push the envelope a little further. The bondage scenes and Steale's brassiere and panties ensembles became a bit repetitive. Some of the situations could have been mined for more humor."

        "review_detailed_main": "that is so so full of comedy movie it is comedy version of fifty shades of Grey whole story is same as i guess but topic are now changed Grey is all about romance and drama and this is just all about comedy or else you can say this is same comedy version like meet the spartan is comedy version of 300 so when you are going to watching a comedy version of any film make sure you did watched it's original version it makes you more laugh. i enjoyed full movie very very much nothing to tell because same as of Grey version but in Grey movie you will enjoy some sex scene and here this guy just come out it 1 min and movie is full with this type comedy and the best dialogue i listen it is when the girl beating men with hunter and she said,\" And this is for the little white girl in Fifty Shades of Grey she had to be naked in whole movie! this is best dialogue. i don't know why it's IMDb rating is 3.5 i noticed people is not rating much to comedy movies but i give it 9 . some movies have low rating doesn't mean it is flop this is one not it earn doubled then it's budget. i don't know why the i am not watching it for a long time i thought it is just same as the Grey version but yesterday when i watched it's trailer then i got interest."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is better suited to a YouTube mini series or a Vine-style comedy. It is hilarious, but only if you don't actually watch the whole thing in one sitting.\n\nI watched this movie during study breaks at about 10-20 minute increments at a time. It is definitely cringe-worthy and there are some scenes where the humour is really grasping at straws.\n\nBut one thing the film has going for it, is that it really follows the original 50 Shades to a T, and when it pokes fun at it, it's really spot on. I personally hated 50 Shades of Grey, and enjoyed spending my breaks entertaining myself with senseless humour every so often.\n\nI can't imagine actually sitting through the whole 1 hour and a half of it in one sitting, but I did appreciate the laughs this movie gave me.\n\nBest enjoyed in increments - Probably not the best compliment a movie could have, but it does enhance the watching experience in my opinion."

It had a few jokes that fell flat, but the characters were interesting - in fact, Hannah nailed Dakotah Johnson as Anastasia.\n\nMy boyfriend, who wanted to watch it, enjoyed it a lot and laughed out loud (I did a little too). I also appreciated the brief female empowerment twist.\n\nI haven't seen the original, but the ending is probably just as contrived/abrupt in that. The digs it takes at it are perfect, perhaps the \"vampire bite\" kiss early in the film was even a super meta joke about it being Twilight fan-fiction.\n\nI'm someone who does not like Scary Movie, Haunted House, etc. This one was the right amount of crude and clever for me.\n\nIt wasn't riotous laughs all the way through, but I'm giving it an extra star out of commiseration."

I consider this progressive humour, it's not afraid to make fun of all genders and races, so much comedy is censored and tame these days this is what the world needs more of, but don't watch it with your family!"

They may be good, they may have interesting jokes, but they don't often make me laugh at loud. This movie is different because it made me laugh, and I mean hard, straight from the gut laughs. Its so funny that people will to my room to see what I'm laughing at. And what's even better, is that it's funny from start to finish. They really worked on the script because there's something funny in every scene. And that's rare. But you have to like dark, juvenile humor."

I also enjoyed the other scenes making fun of other movies most notably magic mike. I can't understand why this movie has a 4 % on rotten tomatoes. This is exactly why I don't go by anyone else's opinion on Movie's. This is 85 minutes filled with laughs and I highly recommend you watch it.\n\nTimothy Treakle."

I'm not even a Marlon Wayans fan at all, but this movie really is funny. I am not sure why there are so many poor reviews. I watch it every time it's on and usually catch a new joke that I missed before. Would love to see a part two. Kali. Hawk is beautiful and talented actress!!
