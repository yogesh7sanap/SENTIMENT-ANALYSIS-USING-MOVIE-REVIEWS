        "review_detailed_main": "We went to this film intentionally (knowing its reputation) as a means of escaping a really busy and stressful Friday. We don't recommend the film to anyone with serious cinematic intentions, However, as kitsch this film almost succeeds. So, OK, we tried to come home and convince our \"knowing\" kids that \"In the name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\" was worth the Friday opener vote, but broke down laughing about five minutes into our rave when they just were not having any of it.\n\nSo let me add a few cogent notes. For 'entertainment' value, given what we were looking for after a long Friday, we were very satisfied, though we worried at times that our guffaws and groans, and open commentary, might have disturbed some of the other 30 or so people in the theater (but for their own laughing). King Burt Reynolds? Oh well. We have to admit that Ray Liotta's \"Goodfellas\" reprise as an evil mage was the most amazing thing we've seen since Jack Lemmon's service as Horatio in Branagh's \"Hamlet.\" Of course, this mention of Uwe Boll's effort alongside Kenneth Branagh is totally appropriate, except that Branagh's \"Hamlet\" had little entertainment value of any kind. School is still out on which of these two can make the worst film of a decade.\n\nIf Matthew Lillard's over-the-top contributions to \"In the name o...\" (which is all of the title that fits on the ticket marquee at the theater) served well in a film with vine dangling amazons, synchronized ninja archers, prolonged out-of-focus long shots, granular irrational close-ups, and some of the most inane dialog in the history of film, one wondered in that case why Scooby Doo didn't put in a cameo in one of the dungeon or castle scenes.\n\nNonetheless, many of the second tier characters were convincing and well acted, amidst all the mish-mosh of incongruous effects and disaffects. So there were moments when one, though not entirely forgetting how bad this film was, felt sorry for many of those who found themselves in it. Or should they all have known better?\n\nBut laugh! Oh my, did we laugh, to the extent that it became uncomfortable laughing at a screen strewn with dead bodies and actors struggling for motivation. Oh, we could have seen high drama or thought-provoking art, but this way our Friday night was pure poetry...\n\nthe dungeon it was dark and dank the bodies in a pile and there atop the smelly heap was Ray Liotta's smile.\n\nhis polyester wizard suit bespoke a man with guile but then behind a squeaky line was Ray Liotta's smile\n\nwhen Uwe Boll directs a film the casting's done with style that's why for evil, nothing's like sweet Ray Liotta's smile\n\nand though we hoot and holler at such feckless goofy bile now laughing all the way to bank is Ray Liotta's smile"

The editing is VERY choppy and amateurish. The actors looked bored and unexcited. The krugs were basically ORCs stolen from Lord of the Rings.\n\nI should have waited until it was dollar night.

I'm a fan of Jason Statham which made me want to see it despite my expectations, plus I work at a theatre and see movies for free which makes me less picky about the movies I watch.\n\nNow I don't typically leave reviews for movies, but after seeing this I felt that I needed to warn people. Up until tonight, I'd never seen a movie directed/produced by this Uwe Boll guy and believe me, as I write this I wish that was still the case. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie and you realize it within the first ten minutes. The cast is brutal, Statham, Liota and Reynolds are all laughable as the main characters. The evil army of 'Krug' reminded me of the dudes in monkey suits in the early Planet of the Apes movies. During action scenes you see the same shot over and over again as if they only had one shot of 'bad guy hit by arrow'. Even the props were bad, Stathams sword looked like something you'd give a six year old on Halloween.\n\nI don't even know if I can accurately put into words how bad this movie is. The best way to describe this pile is to piture you and your friends trying to remake 'lord of the rings' in your backyard, because what you ended up with would be of similar quality.\n\nIf you read this review, don't make the same mistake I did. Don't watch it to see if it is as bad as the guy on the IMDb said it was. This movie should only be shown to criminals in jail as further punishment for their crimes."

I didn't realize that Ewe Boll was directing, otherwise I would have skipped it altogether (he should never be allowed near a camera, ever). However, I like nearly every star, enjoy the genre and have been a big fan of the video games for years now, so I figured that this would be worth seeing (nothing will ever compare to LOTR, but it sounded promising).\n\nSo yeah, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said here already. Horrible dialog, two-dimensional characters, lousy cinematography, cheesy effects and a plot which is nearly impossible to care about makes this one worth skipping.\n\nSeriously, don't pay to see this. It will only encourage them to give Ewe more projects."

Almost bad enough to be considered a guilty pleasure just so you can writhe and cringe at how awful it is. Granted, it's not as bad as last year's Eragon, but don't expect anything close to what Lord of the Rings offered us in terms of epic fantasy adventure.\n\nOh, and those ten star reviews you keep reading?

Never buy,rent, download or even think of borrowing it from a friend. Its a waste, and a huge one too. And be advised never to watch a Boll movie again, its enough already.\n\nEDIT: I've posted this a while back and I just wanted to add something.\n\nIf you're reading this and you happen to work at a store where you sell video games, please and I beg you memorize the name and face of Uwe Boll and if you see him crossing the street immediately shut your doors and windows and put that close sign.

All of these, and more, actors gave a splendid performance.\n\nThe overall production is excellent and the movie flows along at a good pace. The story is nothing new but interesting enough none the less. It provided me with 2.5+ hours of entertainment so I give it 7/10."

As we sat through the entire movie, we watched others leave and never come back, listened to the boys behind us comment on how bad it sucked, and I was wondering if there was a money back policy for bad movies.

The locations were beautiful, costumes were good and the story was interesting. I'd recommend this movie to a friend. Just don't go in expecting Academy Awards and you should be fine. The only real complaint that I had with it was Matthew Lillards character... I felt like I was watching Stu from Scream try to recite Shakespeare or something. Everyone else played it quite well, but Lillard was a bit too quirky and pulled me out of the moment quite often. Aside from that, lots of good action and Jason Statham kicking some ass!

The way the film is shot is in an incredibly shoddy and repetitive manner, and the film is one of the most ineptly directed films I have seen in years. And if that wasn't any worse, just listen to the dialogue, which is so clunky and juvenile. The story is too thin for the running time and the pacing is constantly on and off, while the characters are clich\u00e9d and I felt indifferent to every single one of them. The scenery is gaudy, likewise with the costumes, while the props look like fancy dress items more than anything else. The acting is also dreadful, Burt Reynolds and Ron Perlman can't do anything with their roles, Jason Statham is handsome and charismatic but his acting range is limited here and I have never seen Ray Liotta overact so embarrassingly than he did here. Overall, a mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

The back and forth between all the characters makes you feel a bit overwhelmed at first, but after a while when you get to grasp the plot it just becomes annoying. It's like the Director is saying \"Okay, now we've got to show you what's going on with these characters right this second,\" even if what they're cutting to is inconsequential.\n\nThe acting itself is underwhelming, as is the script. The script calls for the cast to sound noble or poetic at times, but it just comes off as cheesy. The plot was a bit outlandish, but I cannot complain here as I knew it could be as this was a Fantasy. So you'd think that the special effects would redeem this as it's a big Action/Adventure/Fantasy type? Sorry, the monsters didn't look more than a pile of mud wearing mud colored armor, the battle scenes weren't anything special, and the magic special effects weren't anything we haven't seen before with a few twists.\n\nPros: Jason Statham finally shows that a Boomerang can be a deadly weapon. Much Better than Paul Hogan in Crocodile Dundee. Cons: \"Choppy,\" too long, bad acting, bad script, sub-par effects."

Well the music is so bad in this film it spoils it. I wonder how well it would have done with Hans Zimmer or the late John Williams behind the music 3) Nothing particularly new in the story, very similar to parts of LOTR and Eragon\n\nOverall i liked it, and people who gave it such bad scores must not be into this sort of genre, or are being too picky, as its an enjoyable movie to watch."

It seemed very \"physical\" and hands-on.

It may be cheesy, and it may be clich\u00e9d, but at least it has some decent effects here and there and alright fight moves.\n\nIf you have to see this, and you played the Dungeon Siege game, go with a friend, as I did. It should make for a good laugh.\n\nAll-in-all, despite it being a pretty average movie, it's Uwe Boll's best so far."

If you want to see a fantasy movie, and you have seen all the good ones, this is worth a spin. Loads of action. Well choreographed. The trailer movies on the DVD imply you are an idiot man who likes to watch movies for the boobs and violence, which doesn't set the mood, I admit. But there is no exploitation of women in this movie, and some of the women even take up swords. So, okay, this isn't Shakespeare. If fact, prepare thyself for character arcs that are vapid and almost theme-less. It's basically a medieval/supernatural revenge tale. But if you're just looking for a no-brainer fix of non-dragon fantasy and action, especially on a weekend afternoon, you will enjoy this. Jason S. is excellent."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sword-and-Sorcery epic deals with a countryman named Farmer played by Jason Statham as lead accompanied by two partners , Ron Perlman and Will Sanderson , taking on multiple adventures , monsters and dangers . Thrilling and spectacular movie full of fantasy that introduces us a brave hero and appointed to juvenile public and full-blooded adventure aficionados. Sword-and-sorcery saga with stirring action , spectacular images and fantastic scenes including witchery ,witchcraft and necromancy . Set in the kingdom of Ehb, the tale tells a good man called Farmer (Jason Statham), who was adopted by a family . The man married a gorgeous woman and a son sets out to rescue his abducted wife named Solana (Claire Forlani) and revenge a death , two acts executed by the Krugs, a race of monster-warriors who are dominated by the wicked Gallian (Ray Liotta). When Farmer's wife and his son leave their hut to sell cabbage at the village of Stonebridge, Farmer's farm is attacked by strange creatures called Krugs. With the help of his neighbor Norrick (Ron Perlman) he travels to Stonebridge; however, the Krugs capture his wife. With the assistance of Norrick ( Ron Perlman )and Bastian (Will Sanderson)Farmer's brother-in-law, and a magician (John Rhys Davies) he tries to encounter and save his wife. Furthermore , they are helped by an intrepid Amazon woman (Kristanna Loken) . The Krugs are being submitted by the sorcerer Gallian with the collaboration of the King's nephew Fallow (Matthew Lillard) who intend to amass an army to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds), being supported by his commandant (Brian White). At the end takes place an impressive battle between wizards (Ray Liotta , John Rhys-Davies and his daughter played by Lelee Sobieski) and Farmer .\n\nThis exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, violence and is pretty entertaining , though mediocre .This is a tale of magic , imagination, blood and wizardly set in a mythical world from Middle Age full of barbarisms . It packs large amount of fights in \u00a8Lord of Rings\u00a8 style , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense several struggles in which the warriors are staked bloodily in the chest, beheaded or slashed . There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood . Most of monsters called Krugs and humans victims are relegated to being stabbed in the chest ,throat or neck. Breathtaking images , spectacular battles and duels and lots of amusement and entertainment . Made on a fairly big scale with spectacular set design and glimmer photography . Quite budget for a German/Canada/US co-production and lavishly produced by the same Uwe Boll. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score and colorful cinematography ; furthermore spectacular production design . The motion picture is regularly directed by Uwe Boll . All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in America, but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. Having directed 25 movies up to 2011, Boll is panned by the critics and he has received below average reviews. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of adventure films or those enjoy in general.The film will appeal to fantasy buffs with action enough to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Sword-sorcery genre enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because action and adventures are thrillingly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact. Rating : 5,5 ; average though some moments is amusing."

The plot is very simple, yes, but that alone is no reason to consider a film bad.\n\nThe actors do their job.

The sets are decent enough and the FX are certainly not abysmal.\n\nMy verdict: If you're a fan of the genre, see it. It won't be the experience of your life but it will most likely be a fun evening with popcorn and pals."

        "review_detailed_main": "Uwe Bol has made some terrible films. I certainly won't defend his making crap like \"House of the Dead\" and \"Alone in the Dark\". And, I noticed that quite a few of his films are on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...including this movie. But I also noticed that \"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\", despite it's pathetic score of 3.8 that it's really NOT a bad film. Flawed, yes...but overall rather enjoyable if you like fantasy films.\n\nThe story is about an evil sorcerer (Ray Liotta) who is in league with a pathetic wiener, the King's nephew (Matthew Lilliard). And, using the sorcerer's power, he is able to make the brainless Krug attack the people of Ehb and in the surrounding countryside. Amazingly, the fate of the people all rests on the back of a simple farmer (Jason Statham) and his small band of allies.\n\nSo what are the film's weaknesses...other than having Uwe Bol's name on the picture? Some of the characters (in particular, Statham) are underwritten and wooden and a few of the casting decisions are strange...though they mostly work. Some of the dialog is a bit silly. And, sometimes the film was very easy to predict. But, if you turn off your brain and just enjoy the story, the great music and the lovely BIG cinematography, there is a good movie here. Great? Certainly not...but not a bad film at all...and one I found I enjoyed even though I was totally expecting to hate it.\n\nBy the way, I noticed some reviewers called it, essentially, a bad \"Lord of the Rings\" knockoff. Despite having John Rhys-Davies, the film really didn't seem to be trying to copy the trilogy. The closest movie to this one might be one more like \"Krull\" or \"Conan\"...which is also quite watchable."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me first say that I am a huge fan of Fantasy movies so would normally cut any film of this genre some slack. However, this movie is so terrible on so many levels that it doesn't even have hopes of making it as a \"bad\" cult classic. The script was poorly written, the acting (even by an all-star cast) was terrible and ran the gambit between lack-luster and over-acting. The dialog was boring and, depending on which character was speaking, ranged widely from having a stilted \"old-style\" tone to nearly modern - which was jarring. Also jarring were the horrible costumes and prosthetic monster make-up, both of which looked like they came from a local, cheap Halloween costume store...the special effects were slightly better and the backdrops/settings and set dressings were truly of good quality but this is about the only thing that can be said in favor of this film. The movie didn't know whether it wanted to be a comedy or a drama and mixed elements of both...poorly. There was virtually no character development and two of the main characters (played by Jason Stratham and Ray Liota) did not even feel like they fit in the time period/genre of the movie. Jason still had the look of a modern-day action star caught erroneously in a medieval setting and his martial skills were way, way under-used. In fact, the fight scenes in general were long, boring and poorly filmed. And Ray's modern-style haircut (complete with styling gel) was distracting and made him look as if he just stepped out of a salon - and his performance was so over the top as to make the main villain of the movie appear ridiculous and pathetic. Only three actors are worthy of mention as providing consistent and worthwhile performances: Brian J. White, Claire Forlani and John Rhys-Davies(in that order). Ron Perlman was also not bad....but unfortunately, none of them are the main focus of this film which just drags on and on and on..... Wow...what else can be said....the music was bad, ranging from melodramatic to Saturday-morning cartoonish - all of it noticeable and distracting. The editing was poor - some scenes were blurry or had a totally different color tone from other frames - again very noticeable. Some of the special FX were good but they too were few and far between. Lastly, the plot is entirely predictable with every clich\u00e9 imaginable being used and nothing new or memorable to look forward to. As a lover of fantasy movies (and games) I felt compelled to sign-on and warn others about this movie. I am a fan of Conan, The Barbarian Brothers and many other \"B-Grade\" Fantasy movies...this one is an F-Grade!! It is not as good as Eregon (which is not saying much) and is nearly as bad as Dungeons and Dragons! Don't bother!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie has Jason Statham drop-kicking orcs, has flaming orcs used as catapult ammunition, has Burt Reynolds in a ridiculous oversized helmet looking exactly like an imperial town guard from Morrowind (his King's Guard also consists of domino-wearing dual-wielding ninjas who always enter a scene with special fanfare), and many other goodies too: John Rhys-Davies playing Gandalf, Ray Liotta as a very campy villain with a funny accent, a whole gang of forest-dwelling... er... amazons??... with vine-commanding powers Tarzaning around the woods, and Ron Perlman too, leading a pig on a leash before kicking orc ass himself. C'mon people, give Uwe a chance. This movie is awesome.\n\nWe also get Claire Forlani as Statham's wife, Leelee Sobieski in plate armour, why not, a comic relief secondary villain who wants to be king, and Mike Dopud -- Stargate fans, for one, will know his name -- doing his best bearded impression of an Anglo-Saxon warrior. Oh, and let's not forget that Jason Statham, who is so very important in the final act, is never given any armour and fights in the thickest of m\u00eal\u00e9es in a cloth shirt. I guess the armour might hamper his ability to drop-kick orcs and run on their shoulders... or was that some other film?...\n\nThis movie is Uwe Boll's masterpiece. With a very high budget (especially compared to its atrocious sequels), it's Boll's \"Lord of the Rings\". Massive battles with actual actors, costumed orcs in fairly large numbers, sweeping shots and good matte paintings. Don't get me wrong, this movie is very far from the quality of the actual LotR films, but still manages to be truly entertaining and fun.\n\nDon't take it too seriously, don't go in expecting a cinematic masterpiece, and don't let Boll's infamy cloud your judgement. This one is worth a watch... even two in my case, as I rewatched it years after seeing it for the first time, and was thoroughly entertained throughout; I'll probably rewatch it again after a few more years and enjoy it greatly once again.\n\nI swear to God, it's ridiculous how much Burt Reynolds looks like one of the guards in Seyda Neen in Morrowind (that's \"The Elder Scrolls III\", a game from 2002, for those not in the know). It's glorious and I can't take him seriously at all.\n\nThis film is much, much better than people give it credit for. The same is not true for other Boll movies, I concur, but this one is pretty entertaining -- a perfect storm of ludicrous and wonderful. I thoroughly recommend it."

A powerful magus by the name of Gallian is using magical powers to control the orc-like Krug. Also working with him is Duke Fallow, the King's nephew, who wants power for himself. Farmer wants nothing to do with the war but when his son is killed and his wife taken he has no choice if he is to save her. He heads off in search of her with his friends Norick and Bastian; together they face various difficulties and are ultimately separated. Farmer later learns a hidden truth about himself before helping lead the fight against the Krug and ultimately facing Gallian.\n\nI was surprised to see just how negatively reviewed this film has been; it may not be great but it is far from terrible. There is plenty of impressive action; this is exciting and stylishly choreographed by Siu-Tung Ching. The story may contain many clich\u00e9s but just about every film in this genre does to some degree. Jason Statham does a solid job as Farmer and there is solid support from Ron Perlman as Norick. Some people weren't too keen on Matthew Lillard's performance as Duke Fallow but I rather liked it; the character was never meant to be heroic in anyway. Not all the performances impressed though; I never bought Burt Reynolds as the king and the less said about Ray Liotta's Gallian the better... he was more camp than commanding; certainly he never looked a match for Statham. While the highlight of the films were the battle scenes there were other impressive moments; I particularly liked the mysterious women of the forest and the way they moved on long vines. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre; it may not be the best example but neither is it the worst that I've seen, by quite some way."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fortunately, I read a few reviews before watching this. I had already ordered it as part of my mail-in DVD program, so I was stuck with rental, even if I had been thoroughly warned by the folks here. At least I had low expectations now, so I wasn't disappointed when I discovered - yes - it's certainly was not up to what you'd think by looking at the famous names in the cast.\n\nThe actor who astounds me the most is Ray Liotta. What has happened to him since \"Goodfellas\" fame to do something like this? Has his career plummeted this bad, or did he just make a poor choice of roles to play? I can see Burt Reynolds taking anything since he's peak days are long gone, and Leelee Sobieski, because she's never been a star, but Liotta?\n\nActually, to present both sides, the action scenes, the costumes and the story overall are not boring and not the worst thing I've ever seen. Some of the special-effects were a lot of fun to watch, so it's not all bad.....but the dialog is horrendous. It totally ruins the film and makes the whole movie appear like some B-grade cheapie. It's why I also was disappointed to see Ron Perlman and John Rhys-Davies being part of this.\n\nThe worst acting performance in here, by far, was not Liotta but Matthew Lilliard as \"Duke Fallow,\" the son of the king. How Reynolds, who had a fine career, could work opposite this over-the-top guy and keep a straight face, is beyond me. Lilliard overacted so bad, it was embarrassing to watch. I can only hope he was supposed to act that ludicrously, but if that's the case his character is so annoying, it's not fun to view.\n\nJason Statham: well, I've had it watching his movies. I loved his early work (\"Snatch,\" \"The Transporter,\" etc.) but now he's just a ridiculous action-freak-character, one of these guys who can beat up 50 people by himself in every film, especially this one, as \"Farmer.\" I have to admit, however, I did like him using a boomerang as a weapon. I thought that was pretty cool. I like Claire Forlani, too, who played his wife.\n\nSadly, the dislikes far outweigh the likes and I can see why so many reviewers here panned this film. With this cast, I guess all of us expected a better film."

I barely did even so (I swear this flick made me even more nauseated than I already was). Another reviewer was kinder when (s)he wrote that it wasn't that the actors were bad per se -- because most of them certainly were. Only John Rhys-Davies, who's done this kind of crap before, taken it seriously, and taken it to the bank, and Claire Forlani were making any kind of effort at all. Not the rest. Ron Perlman was hamming it up on autopilot, but at least his ham act wasn't half as objectionable to the ones put forth by Matthew Lillard and Ray Liotta, which were grossly annoying. Leelee Sobieski basically sleepwalked through this thing, reprising bad bits form her St. Joan effort of several years ago, and Jason Statham frowned and grunted his way through the film, whereas Burt Reynolds couldn't even bother to be conscious for it and stared his way through it all, projecting the most godawful monotone and excruciating boredom with the whole thing (remind me again: **WHY** does anybody consider this fossil an actor??!). Reynolds and Liotta delivered their absolute worst performances of all time in this wasted effort. What the whole mess deserves is a mercy killing. If this review process allowed me to give it a zero, I would."

I'm not going to tell you not to watch this movie, because I think with a blunt and a good beer, it will make for some good laughs.

It had bad parts in acting, fake scenery and generic story. But it also had decent to even good parts in the same area's, and the bad parts are not as bad as people here will have you believe. There was not much wrong with the fighting scenes, good fun I thought, and camera and directing were certainly not great, but I've seen much worse.\n\nAll in all it's a somewhat generic fantasy movie that does some things bad and some things good.

People seem to love to hate this director, but I don't know him.\n\nSo as a completely neutral unbiased viewer I rate this film a 6.5/10 Quite alright for when you feel like watching a fantasy flick some night."

It features Jason Statham ( as TELNETTed directly from Crank - with the same bitter disposition to kill everyone ) + Burt Reynolds ( makes a good king of cowboy rodeo shows maybe). Claire Forlani could have saved a little the movie with her agreeable presence, but when calling her husband \"Farmer\" all the magic was gone ( imagine being called by your wife - a \"peasant\"). So if you expect a new Lord Of The Rings you will be very disappointed, but if you really pay attention to the movie is the funniest crappiest movie I've seen in a long time. If ever I will have a depression, I will rush to see another Uwe Boll movie.\n\nCheerios,"

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, you know what? We've all had our fun with Uwe, and I'm no exception. I consider Uwe Boll movies to be a unique experience in cheese cinema, but I say this sincerely: I liked this movie. There.\n\nIt was MUCH better than Bloodrayne, which was laughably bad, and in fact I'd say Uwe was starting to get a handle on making movies that don't cause eyes to roll .\n\nI know it sounds silly, but I liked these characters, the acting wasn't so terrible and the dialogue wasn't painful.\n\nFlaws: The film ends too abruptly, and there are story details sort of pushed through in a clumsy way, and some of the acting is over the top.\n\nIt IS a cheesy movie (look out, there are NINJAS!!!), but this movie was much more fun than Eragon or Dungeons and Dragons. Plus, I can certainly appreciate Uwe's shaping of a fantasy world, it's mythology. I also appreciate how he went all out on the action and fantasy element.\n\nThe actors handled themselves very decently. I was very impressed with Burt Reynold's restraint as the King. I really had doubts about his part, but he did a decent job and did it subtley opposite Matthew Lillard's more frantic pacing (Lillard was having waaaay too much fun, lol)\n\nLeelee Sobieski was adorable and John Rhys Davies was a joy to watch (and he's done some truly bad movies) Jason Statham, Ron Perleman and Will Sanderson were fun to watch as a trio of brothers in arms, and they carried some nice chemistry. Brian J White was particularly good also. Overall, the cast was not bad.\n\nIf you are one of the many that crusade against Uwe, my review will not make much of a dent, and it's a shame because maybe, just maybe he is getting better in small steps. But I have to be honest, I enjoyed this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is my first Uwe Boll film. I have deliberately tried to keep an open mind on this director until I have actually seen one of his films. It sounds like a lot of people trash his films before they see them just because it is directed by him. I think that is both insane and unfair.\n\nSo I really had no idea of what to expect. After a few moments it was clear that this was a LOTR clone, with an infinitesimally smaller budget and done in a \"B-movie\" style. Taken on that level, my wife and I really enjoyed the film.\n\nI honestly cannot fathom the hatred for Dr. Boll. The film was competently directed, and I found some of the photography breathtaking, the music beautiful, some really cool stunts and fight scenes, and found at least some of it really suspenseful. Whatever one may feel about this movie, to say it is done by someone who has NO talent is - in my opinion- a grossly unfair and unreasonable statement.\n\nYes, some of the acting was poor (the mother in particular), but most of the acting was fine and I took Liotta's role as a hammy-over-the-top performance that it was meant to be and really enjoyed him chewing up the scenery. You really can't take his scenes seriously - and I don't think they were meant to me.\n\nThe plot was decent, and made a lot more sense than the National Treasure 2 disaster I saw. And the movie experience was infinitely more pleasurable than sitting through any of the Star Wars prequels or Matrix sequels. And those were done by some of the most respected directors by both critics and audiences alike.\n\nPersonally, I think Dr. Boll was having fun with this film. And if I could fault him for anything it was to be too ambitious with a modest budget in a genre that has films like LOTR associated with it. But that can be viewed as a complement for a man who obviously is trying to stretch himself as a filmmaker.\n\nI understand his other works may be turkeys (I will refrain from judgment until I see them for myself), but each film needs to be judged on it's own merits. Personally I found the Hulk, Matrix Reloaded and Phantom Menace to be real turkeys- so does that mean it's OK to call those directors 'the worst directors ever to have lived' and sign a petition to have them stop directing? This film struck me as a Saturday matin\u00e9e experience - at 2pm with a bunch of friends and a big bucket of popcorn. A \"B\" movie to be sure, but one of the better ones to me.\n\nNo, this isn't a great movie, but an enjoyable one if you can let go of comparisons and previous comments about the director. When I see reviews start off with \"just like any other Boll film, you can expect garbage..\" it makes me wonder how many people really gives his films a chance.\n\nCount me as a minority of one, but I look forward to seeing more of his films. Certainly more so than another film by Lucas or the Wachowski brothers.\n\nI gave this a 7. If you want to take into consideration all the unfair crap this director has gotten, I would bump it up to an 8 just to help even out the score."

Almost like from the TV-series Hercules and Xena. This is like Battlefield: Earth, but with a middle-earth theme. This movie is one of the worst i have ever seen. Everything is bad. Costume design, special effects, plot, music and dialog are all low budget TV-series quality. I'm starting to think Uwe does this on purpose. I mean he can't be this bad, but he is. This movie is a form of torture that should be forbidden by the Geneva Convention."

The script is bland and doesn't usually fit into the anticipated atmosphere of the scene. Jason S. uses a boomerang to kill \"Krug\" which are supposed to be like Orcs on LOTR. They look more like dirty Power Rangers. Burt R plays an emotionless king and is such a golden aspect of the unanticipated humor.\n\nI can't recommend this film enough!

        "review_detailed_main": "In the Name of the King, the latest film from Uwe Boll. Boll the whipping boy of film fans everywhere continues to make movies despite the fact that people \"hate his films\", which they go to even though they hate them. Yes I've disliked a number of his films, House of the Dead is one of the worst films ever made; Alone in the Dark is horrible, but plays better if you come in 25 minutes in and can make up what you've missed; and BloodRyne I liked, despite performances that ranged from good to nonexistent because it reminded me of the Italian Fantasy Films of the early 1980's. Boll is back in theaters with one of four films released world wide in 2007. (2007 is a busy year and included his boxing, literally, critics who despised his films-he won)\n\nThe plot of the film has something to do with Jason Statham, a farmer going off to take revenge after an evil horde invades his town, kills his son and kidnaps his wife. He travels with Ron Perlman and several other in a quest that leads them into several big battles and to the castle of the evil wizard Ray Liotta.\n\nWatching the film I came to a rather odd conclusion, this is actually a pretty good, if very dense little film.The film looks good. the actors are all pretty much on the same page, the action is nicely staged, and the story is light years better than most of the direct to video films that were spawned by Lord of the Rings. This plays very much like we are in a real place so is unlike the dress up/ Ren Faire we've been getting lately (the Dungeons and Dragons films anyone?) I liked the film enough to look forward to getting it on DVD and the hunkering down and watching it on a rainy Sunday with my brother.\n\nTo be certain the film is not perfect. I could see tell at the outset that Boll's means of casting (through lots of money out close to the time they shoot in order to get any actor in need of quick cash to get bigger names then he has a \"right\" to) was going to be a problem in a few places. First off its going to produce a cast with accents all over the place, Ray Liotta, Jason Stratham, John Rhys-Davies, Leelee Sobieski and Burt Reynolds are all in different places vocally. Its also a problem in that the acting styles clash, with Liotta seemingly out of place and Reynolds, whom I never ever expected to see in a film like this, a bit too knowing.(I won't discuss the hair styles of any of them because that would take too long)\n\nIf the film itself has any problems its that its a long dense haul.A great deal happens and is discussed and after a about an hour I did begin to wear down. I'm sure once this hits DVD or cable it will play better where there can be breaks.\n\nBoll is growing as a director. He's made a decent little fantasy. I look forward to seeing this again, and I'll even go see the threatened sequel.\n\n7 out of 10"

All those monster soldiers made of obvious rubber cheap outfit, remind me the \"Ninja Turtles\" ( another piece of...art, made in Vancouver ).\n\nThe acting is bad, the cast is bad, Ray Liotta is bad acting and cannot even succeed to laugh naturally... It seems that the budget was entirely used for the last five minutes of the movie, with a couple of nice computer graphic effects and that's it ! By the way, it looks that it had been shot in the very same location of the 1999 movie \" The 13th warrior\", the setting looks pretty similar, but this time, Antonio Banderas did not want to make another mistake !!!..."

I like Jason Statham movies, but this one does not do him justice. Leelee Sobieski looked great and super hot in her armor, but she barely did anything in the movie. Yes the movie was a fantasy and there is no time period for the movie, but Burt Reynolds has a Texan accent leading a lot English knights. His part as king is not believable. Ray Liotta is the bad guy, but his acting did not fit his character either. He has a Brooklyn accent,and he is more comical than evil. I feel that James Marsteers would have made a better Villain. The coolest scene Ray has is when he fighting John Rhys-Davies's character. Matthew Lillard, the goofy Duke, kills the movie with some really bad acting as well.

Postal was funny, but not really a good movie per se. With Dungeon Siege, Boll really shows his best movie work to date. Of course he'll be kicked in the balls again by hordes of geeks, but don't lead that fool you.\n\nThere are two kinds of failures: bad ones and boring ones. Boring movies are just unwatchable tedious, just like White Noise 2. Bad movies are just plain bad, like Boa vs Komodo. I seriously don't know how anyone could place Boll's flicks in the same league as they're clearly better. Dungeon Siege is not great, but neither bad nor boring.

Thats would explain this atrocity to the genre.\n\nThe only reason i didn't walk out of this movie is because i wanted to see exactly HOW bad it could get. I really did laugh my @$$ off.

The really bad thing is they did manage to get some moderately good actors in the film, like Jason Statham, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Burt Reynolds, and Claire Forlani (who is also extremely hot). But, it was sort of like they called these people up and said, \"How much to show up and stay till the final cut?\". Then paid them just that amount, gave them the scripts, started filming, but the had the director or producer work on something else. The acting was terrible. How do good actors act that poorly? Were they supposed to look like drama school dropouts? If so, mission accomplished.\n\nStay far, far away from this movie. Watch anything else. Watch an infomercial, watch paint dry, just please don't watch this movie."

This movie lacked both. If I were Jason, or John, or Kristen, or Bert, I would gladly give back my fee and even a little extra to have every copy of this go the way the George Lucas wants the Star Wars Holiday Special to go. (I.e., with a sledge hammer!)\n\nIt is sad how much I wanted this move to be great! Some of the back ground shots, the cgi, is amazing. The trailer pretty much has all the best scenes in it and they are only so good when taken out of context of the awful before and after scenes. In the end, what a waste. I and I am sure most of the crew would like two hours or several months of our lives back."

I felt it before you came.\" Gallian (Ray Liotta): \"You are developing your powers well, Muriella. Our time together is paying off!\"\n\nPretty much encapsulates what's wrong with this flick. The dialogue is horrible, the script and director give the actors nothing meaningful to work with and the setup is completely cardboard in its appeal.\n\nDon't get me wrong, cardboard can be entertaining, so long as some of the other elements of successful filmmaking come together, as well. No such luck, here.\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, the action choreography is lame, the camera work weak, the editing often insane, the art direction and cinematography limited or nonexistent, the musical score pointless at best...where to begin?\n\nWell, I have nothing personal against a silly, anachronistic, amateurish action movie script that is concocted as a means of wiling away a harmless hour or two, even when it results in bad acting because of the director's complete lack of vision. It's kind of fun to observe how certain actors manage themselves in such a void. And as bad as he was in his role as King Konreid, Burt Reynolds was quite entertainingly cardboard, in my opinion. He walked right through the role playing his bored, wig-wearing self, and he was the only thing I could readily remember, months after I had seen this movie. He was so bad he actually stood out amongst this filmic muck...for the wrong reasons, of course.\n\nA friend of mine had loaned me the DVD, along with several other movies he owns, but I couldn't be sure, months later, whether I had returned this one or something similar. So after searching my place recently to no avail, I was racking my brains for the name of the title, and I finally resorted to searching online using Reynolds' name and the word \"king.\" That was all I could remember of this dud.\n\nPretty sad, huh? That my memory seems to be failing me. Or that Burt Reynolds in a miscast role is the most memorable thing in a movie starring Ray Liotta, also miscast, with Matthew Lillard, also miscast. The list of miscast actors taking away career embarrassment and (presumably, hopefully) a hefty paycheck in exchange for their participation in this $60m stinker continues most of the way down the line.\n\nA possible exception, and what stands out in retrospect for me the most since my memory has now had a chance to be prompted by IMDb's cast listing for the movie, is that I was barely able to recall John Rhys-Davies or Kristanna Loken in their respective, fairly substantial roles here. I think this may be a compliment to the jobs they did, because it may mean that they turned in acting performances that rose above the level of outright ridiculousness, and they thereby avoided the WTF stare I was giving the rest of the cast.\n\nI can't be sure, though. 'Cause none of this movie was memorable for the right reasons."

It has a strong cast who make the best of a somewhat clunky script. The battle sequences are rather good, with a bit more in the way of tactical movement than a lot of similar movies. Jason Statham is, well, Jason Statham up to his usual action tricks. Claire Forlani is excellent and well supported by Ron Perlman. Matthew Lillard is gloriously over-the-top as the villainous nephew of the king. All in all I found it an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, with my brain in neutral."

Boll's resume of films should have indicated to moviegoers that this \"film\" is gonna suck. And I can never understand why the hell Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds are in this POS? I guess money goes a long way of snorting cocaine at the end of a \"hard days work\" should suffice but the latter states the obvious. With that being said, doing that provides \"remedial\" relief for the actors and critics who presumably were subjected to Boll's unique brand of \"film making\" which I'm sure gave them the feeling of being like Alex DeLarge in \"A Clockwork Orange\" forced to watch unspeakable horror.\n\nIf you are a bright, meek, intelligent individual, skip this excrement of Uwe Boll.

Which is especially ironic given his Doctorate in ... Literature! On the evidence he has provided (ie his films) he does not know how to evaluate a script, or cast actors, establish or develop characters, or anything else that relates to the job of 'Director'. Bearing in mind that his movies are produced with money from his own investment fund, he is obviously a highly skilled fund-raiser.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ah, director Uwe Boll. How this man keeps on getting money to make movies is one of the great mysteries of the modern age.\n\nDungeon Siege is a terrible movie. What's surprising is that for the first time in a Boll movie, I at least found myself laughing at (some of) it instead of just wincing in pain. That's not to say bad movie lovers should go see it, but it might be worth a rental some time. If you're planning on being drunk.\n\nThe most astonishing thing about this piece of trash is the cast. True, many of them have seen better days in their careers, but have they really fallen this far? A good chunk of my amusement at this film was seeing a new actor/actress show up and laughing that they were even in this thing. I divided them into four categories while watching- horrible actors, apathetic not-even-trying bad actors, over-top-hammy bad actors, and Jason Statham.\n\nPicture, if you will, Burt Reynolds as the king. Yeah... it was obvious even Burt couldn't picture it, and he doesn't even try. His nephew and heir? Matthew Lillard! How could anyone possibly take a fantasy epic with Burt Reynolds and Matthew Lillard as the only royalty in evidence as anything other than a joke? Lillard plays himself, and his hamminess is only outdone by Ray Liotta as the evil wizard villain. Liotta is so amazingly bad it's hard to believe he ever had a career.\n\nJason Statham actually appears to be trying, and the sheer amount of physical effort the man puts into the endless fight scenes and stunts is astonishing. Maybe he just doesn't know how to not try. He does a good job, but he certainly can't save this turkey from everything else that's wrong with it.\n\nAt over two hours long, the movie seems more like three or four hours long. To give Boll some credit, at least the score was decent. The plot and dialog are laughable- quite literally at some points. Whether or not you'll want to sit through the whole thing to laugh at those parts is kind of questionable.\n\nOne more thing. I almost forgot the synchronized ninjas. Amazingly enough, Uwe Boll even manages to make ninjas suck."

Plus, could it be any more obvious that the Krugs were just men in costume? And, who did the sound editing? Something would happen on screen, and there would be no sound to go along with it. Did anyone else notice that?\n\nBut I had to see it because I'm in love with Jason Statham. I'm just glad a friend rented it, so I spent no money to watch one of the most horrible, generic films that has ever been made."

The action scenes are really cheesy, I felt I was watching a Power Rangers episode for a second, it was that bad. The magic scenes felt like a Harry Potter wannabe.\n\nStay clear away from this film or any other Uwe Boll films as they are a complete waste of your time. This movie should definitely be on the worst of all times list, it at least deserves that much. I still cant believe that this was actually in a theater somewhere."

Think Conan the Barbarian. Most of the people who rated this film did not see it. You'll notice those who did, liked it.\n\nRay Liotta was a little over the top for my taste, but Perlman, Stratham and the rest were solid.\n\nUwe Boll is proving his detractors wrong this year by releasing two good films. Postal is the funniest comedy I have seen in years as well as biting social commentary."

Not even the fight scenes were believable...Farmer is the best of the best of fighters in one minute and in the next, it seems he doesn't remember how to lift a sword...was wondering if perhaps all these folks owed the director and/or producers anything in order to get them involved...big in names but small in talent!

The acting is pretty good as least for most of the actors. Jason Statham and Ron Perlman are the best. Matthew Lillard was upright annoying. He did good in Scooby Doo, but this kind of genre is not for him. Ray Liotta is so-so, might have been miscasted. There is some good scenery to look at. I also liked the music in the film. Not Lord of the Rings like, but still good. There are some holes in the plot and things that are misbelieved. Overall, I have to say that this is Uwe Boll's best movie. I rate this movie 8/10."

Ray Liotta, Jason Statham and Ron Pearlman are all good actors and that alone gives you a reason to watch this. Burt Reynolds is king!!! That's genius in itself. I will stand up and say \"I ENJOYED THIS FILM\". Fight scene's are well done, the story is passable. Wouldn't ever call this one of my fave films but its worth a watch if you fancy something different. I must also add I like Leelee Sobieski a lot.\n\nGive it a go.\n\nI did and am pleased about it and YES I watched the added 37 minutes."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have scarcely the words to express how much I had wished that the presence of Reynolds, Rhys-Davies, Statham and Sobieski would have shielded the now proved tragically ephemeral majesty of the Dungeon Siege saga, from the influence of Uwe Boll.\n\nUndefined characters, haphazardly thrown together for no apparent reason in randomly pieced together storytelling void of passion or heart, flailing aimlessly in and out of unchoreographed combat sequences with no apparent motivation, to a music score that seems as clueless about the plot as any other aspect of this movie. To cap it all off, some desperate unheard creative voice pollinated this putrifying corpse of a movie with surprisingly good special effects by comparison, perhaps in a last ditch effort to scrounge any scraps of production value.\n\nI made myself sit through this movie, and the sequel, start to finish, as I had done with the Bloodrayne movie. I can honestly say I believe Uwe Boll neither glanced at the games, nor had the remotest intent to convey them in these works. In fact, if I'm perfectly honest I can find nothing in either movie to dissuade me from the conclusion that Mr. Boll created not only these two, but all his game-derived works, out of some malicious spite or searing hatred towards gamers and fantasy fans.\n\nI pity any actor that is forced to have their life's work poisoned by this odious malcontent, and any story that must suffer the indignity and torture of being made into a lampshade in Boll's personal Buchenwald of film.\n\nUnlike many others however, I would advise people watch at least as much of this film as they can stomach, to gain a deeper appreciation for the artistry of producing and directing a film. And, if for no other reason, as a warning. A warning that when stories as marvelous as the Dungeon Siege saga are brutalised and ravaged by Mr. Boll, silence.... is as bad as the crime."

I wanted to give it a solid chance because I have a guilty pleasure of enjoying fantasy/science fiction \"B\" movies.\n\nStory \u0096 (this is the writer's first story) weak, uninteresting and no character development at all.\n\nScreenplay \u0096 (this is the writer's first screenplay) the same problem as the story. It's a mess and a amateur attempt at that.\n\nDialogue \u0096 Dull, uninteresting, and just plain silly most of the time.\n\nDirecting-Producing- it's Uwe Boll; well known for getting sucker investors to fund his film work.\n\nCasting \u0096 The miscasted actors are (in order): Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Jason Stratham, Matthew Lillard and Claire Forlani. These respectable actors must have needed money to pay their delinquent taxes, child support or alimony.\n\nActing \u0096 The actors must have laughed off camera to have to speak such ridiculous dialogue. I would have loved to seen the out-takes. These are talented actors that appear talent-less in this film. Exceptions are Kristanna Loken and John Rhys-Davies who do pretty well in their roles.\n\nMusic \u0096 The score is underwhelming at all times. Completely dull and forgettable.\n\nColor \u0096 The color is so washed out it almost looks like it was shot with 3 colors; black, white and brown.\n\nLocation \u0096 Lackluster location used for this film. Apparently, all the good locations in Canada were being used.\n\nCamera work \u0096 At times, it seems like they have a child running around with a hand held camera. The camera is jumpy and does amateur like zoom ins.\n\nFight Action scenes \u0096 Fair to poor and at times, silly. (Not sure how the main character appears to be the best fighter in the land without any training).\n\nThis is the worst movie I've ever seen\u0085.and perhaps; the worst movie ever made. I couldn't get this rented DVD back in it's NetFlix sleeve fast enough. I sincerely believe Producer and Director Uwe Boll is the Ed Wood of our time. Now I just want the 2+ hours of my life back please."

Clearly Liotta is a perfect \"devil\" with Matt Lillard playing his bitch with actual scenes of hell in this film and then Liotta has the audacity to knock up Jason Staham's wife Claire Forilani. Even the young and actually attractive Helen Hunt knockoff Leelee Sobieski and who could forget Burt Reynolds as the king.\n\nA Uwe Bowl production unlike any I have seen in a very long time. Maybe after a few more shots of bourbon, I will figure out why I watched the entire 2 hours and 10 minutes on Showtime. At least it's Jason Statham and I guess they paid the actors really well."

How the hell do you use the same actor from Scooby Doo and pick him above all the others that auditioned? Burt Reynolds...another bad casting choice. He looked like he has had some MAJOR work and didn't quit while he was ahead.

I had no problems with any of the acting even though some people have knocked the dialogue its a d&d type of film and its what you would expect (thankfully its not full of thee's and thou's). At about 2 hours it has the time to tell the story well but do not expect any big surprises if you are a fan of this type of film as it ticks all the box's that you would expect.

That or he paid the middle school tech guys in coffee and donuts.\n\nCostumes: -5. Who fights with a cape? Since when can a peasant afford nice clothes? Be original! Honestly, there is not one redeeming quality or aspect to this film whatsoever. It was boring, far below mediocre and, quite frankly, painful to watch at times. I'm actually embarrassed for the actors.\n\nInstead of watching this movie and wasting your time, pick up \"Last of the Legion\" which is too short to really get into the detail it needs but at least is entertaining. And they all have Colin Firth's accent at least."

Then as I suffered through minute after minute of cheesy dialog my husband reminded me that it indeed was released in theaters?!? I was shocked! How could such anyone have ever payed to see this?! As I watched the poorly edited fight scenes with the Krug army, I was reminded of the slow-no-impact fight scenes of such laughable shows as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. (The film quality was comparable) I kept laughing to keep from going into a rage! I've seen student films that had more depth and dimension than this waste of time. My only hope was that the mildly famous cast of stars had a huge payday for allowing their names and faces to be attached to this.....well....I've run out of ways to call this film a steaming pile of crap.....Please don't waste your time!"

There is not a single time in the film when a character reacts to anything in a way that makes any sense at all. I personally saw hints of what might have been a few decent performances,(namely by Ron Perlman and Leelee Sobieski) but there is no way to know because if there was originally any good in there it was edited out.\n\nMy recommendation, do not see this movie. I do have a few questions though. How does Uwe Boll keep getting work? And why do seemingly decent actors keep agreeing to work with him? Oh and one last thing, Mr. Boll, if your offer of getting in the boxing ring with your critics still stands, I would love to go few rounds with you."

Lord of the Rings) and especially if you are a fantasy role-play gamer (eg. Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer Quest, etc.), I think this movie has a lot to offer. I have to say that I enjoyed myself thoroughly the whole way through.\n\nFirstly, the setting is sublime - I think everyone would have to agree with that comment. Vancouver Island has never looked so majestic - the mountains tower over gorgeous lakes with a rugged pastoral quality mixed in for good measure. The castles are extremely well done as well. Overall, I think Vancouver Island stands up nicely to the epic landscapes of New Zealand in this film.\n\nThe armour and weaponry are absolutely first rate. Again, if you're not a fan of medieval constructs, this might not hold much sway for you, but for me, it was sublime. The armourers did a tremendous job of creating a unique look for the different ranks (from royalty to elite guard to the rank-and-file), and the Krugs had that nasty kind of raw iron look to both their armour and weapons.\n\nNext, the fights were extremely well done. I would say that the fights were more varied, more realistic, and more skillfully done than those in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is high praise indeed. The sheer numbers involved in the mass battles were also awe inspiring. I think they actually had several hundred actors playing those scenes out, not just 20 or 30 and CGIing the rest. Speaking of special effects, the budget wasn't huge, but what was done was effective and fairly original.\n\nAs for the acting and storyline, it wasn't of the same calibre as Lord of the Rings. Several actors in the cast put in wooden and amateur performances. However, I found myself drawn to several of the characters: John Rhys-Davies, Burt Reynolds, the head of the royal guard, and the main character (Jason Statham). Statham was convincing in his \"First Blood Rambo\" sort of way - a super proficient fighter who just wants to be left alone to his simple ways. The storyline is not grandiose or particularly original, but really, there are very few original story lines in film; for audiences to connect with a theme, it must strike familiar chords. This plot touches on many of these well-worn archetypal patterns: the long-lost son returns, the good mage turns mad with power, the honest man overcomes, the power-hungry entitled nephew gets what's coming to him, the peasant outdoes the royalty, etc. I don't see this as a negative - these plot lines are part of the greatest stories in history as well. Are they brilliantly pulled off in this movie? I wouldn't say so, but they are not badly done either.\n\nAnyway, this is certainly not a perfect film, but there are many very fine elements to it. If you love seeing this type of world put into film, I think you will find much to enjoy."

The choreography for the fight scenes was pretty entertaining. Seriously, I loved the pointed feet on the flying leaf vixens and the ninjas, well that was just cute.

I understand the sword and sorcery aspect but can't figure out where the ninjas or Cirque du Soleil performers fit in. Its also interesting that the only person not wearing armor seems to come through without a scratch. Despite a reputable cast the lines are delivered like the actors can't wait to pick up their paychecks and go home. It might actually have helped if there was some continuity. You pretty much have to figure out on your own how the different plot line and scenes mesh."

The movie made no sense, it started as if it was 20 minutes into the movie already and you never had a clue what was happening . It was 2 hours of randomly changing shots that did not fit together to make a movie. The bad guy charter looked like Wayne Newton and could not be taken seriously. The movie did not end, it just stopped and resolved almost nothing. The movie it self was very poorly made. The colors would totally change each time the shot changed, like each camera was using different lenses and had not been white balanced. One shot would be full color and clear, the next shot washed out and grainy, as if shot on a home video camera. The props did not fit the movie. A modern saddle with chrome plated buckles, stamped steel bladed shovels and lots of other little items that did not belong in the middle ages ."

I knew I was in trouble once Burt Reynolds appears on the screen. And what in the world was Jason Statham thinking of when he decided to do this. It is COMPLETELY out of his element, so much so that you would think that this is some sort of Lord of the Rings spoof. It is horrible and a complete mess. The only one who wasn't Over Acting was Claire Forlani! Lets face it, people, its just not a good story and at times I wanted to stop the DVD. I had no idea that this was based off a video game and now that I know that (from the credits), this inspires me to never play that video game. Ray Liotta is his usual over the top self as the bad guy with that crazy laugh of his and yet it doesn't work for him here. Other than playing a wonderful Shaggy in Scooby Doo, Matthew Lillard is just a plain bad actor and an annoying one at that. How does he still get roles? Did he make a deal with the devil? Leelee Sobieski may have decided to do this because she wasn't getting the roles she wanted. she has to be better than this picture. Ron Pearlman was completely flat and just looked as if he was going through the motion and wanted to get this film done in a hurry. Everyone, even the two decent actors (Forlani and Rhys-Davies)were just out of place. It was like watching bad actors at a Reinnassance Festival. Jason Statham does not belong in the middle ages. He is his same old deadpan self and that deadpan delivery doesn't fit here. He only real role is to speak until it time for action and in films like Crank, War and The Transporter, it works, in this film that deadpan delivery just don't cut it.\n\nI clearly blame the director, who's movies that he directed have all been bad (Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne, House of the Dead). It is clear that he doesn't have command of the English language or he wouldn't have accepted these wooden, lifeless, lines deliveries that the principal actors all gave. I am telling you, you will get bored with this movie before you get a third, heck, a quarter of the way through. Do yourself a favor, when you reach that point, just go ahead, eject the DVD because it's not worth seeing this movie to the end. Help yourself and needlepoint, watch paint dry, do shadow puppet, all those are better than watching this movie completely through to the end. Completely disappointed in all this big name actors who decided to do this turkey!"

Does anyone know how to make a decent fantasy movie? LOTR was great, it had drama, suspense, and a thrill here and there; however it took YEARS to make and it shows the hard work. This movie was like how to edit in the worst possible way, how to completely make something that isn't worth being laid in a cat box.\n\nIt is almost as bad as the rash of \"DVD-Camera\" movies I have been seeing lately. Do studios have a QC Department or is it about have fast can you drop dribble at your local AMC Theater?

It is inevitable that one compares this movie to the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, however, one has to bear in mind that what LOTR accomplishes in three movies, Dungeon Siege has to in a short two hours. Unlike LOTR, Dungeon Siege also incorporates some well known actors and familiar faces of the silver screen. For those that found LOTR to be slightly drawn out, you would definitely love this movie. I see that this movie has not received the rating it deserves. However, that is because of the genre this movie falls place into. If you are a fan of fantasy novels growing up and adventure epics such as LOTR and the Chronicles of Narnia, then this movie deserves my utmost recommendation."

I love action/violence in movies, even the cheesy ones, but this was simply unbearable. Burt Reynolds as the king was unbearable.

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was probably the worst movie I have seen in many many years. I have unknowingly seen Uwe Boll films before this one, but did not know this was the same director as those other flicks while watching. So, I can say truthfully that I am about as un-biased as I can get with this review.\n\nThat being said, where do I start? The horrible score? The amazingly childish dialog? The half cooked story? Or the incredibly poor character development?\n\nFirst off, the person responsible for writing this story seems to have ripped off nearly a dozen different fantasy films without bothering to veil the attempt. And the screenplay appears to have been written by a 13 year old. For example: Each scene simply jumps from one thing to another without any connection at all. They show you something, and say \"here are these people and this stuff, look at them for a moment\". And a second later they show you something else and say \"here look at this now\". No continuity or connection at all! I truly felt lost after the first 20 minutes. And believe me, I am not at all easy to lose in a movie. Even really bad ones! The dialog is choppy at best, at worst it's moronic. And integral characters pop up randomly, say \"Hi\", and then vanish till they are needed. Like flash cards before a test. If this had been a book before it was made into a movie, I would almost think the screenplay was written from the Cliff's Notes of that book.\n\nAnd now for the Score! Oh my god! I have never seen a movie scored so badly. I mean I have heard 8 bit video game music more compelling and better placed than this. There are parts of this movie where you are watching and you want to feel something, but you can't! And it is because the music is either utterly goofy or far too weak. And you are left with this empty \"why am I bothering\" feeling that makes you want to just turn it off.\n\nAnd I truly feel so very bad for the actors in this film. One of the big draws for this movie is the tremendous star power it holds. OK, I know a lot of you are snickering at Burt playing the part of the King. But I really think he would have been great if he had been Directed right. There were scenes here that really screamed for that Burt Reynolds charm, but instead he had an almost robotic dialog that I couldn't believe was coming from him. Oh, and Ray Liotta. Holy moley! Ray, you could have been awesome as an evil mage! I was sooo disappointed by the lack of character development there. I have to say one of the major reasons I wanted to see this movie was, Ray Liotta as the big evil. On the plus side, John Rhys-Davies held up OK in his roll. But then, having so recently done the \"Lord Of The Rings\" films, he had something of an advantage over many of the other actors. But still, his character again suffered from that really poor development. The only character the writers and director seemed to have felt it necessary to put forth any effort on was Jason Statham's. And that was poorly managed at best. Where there should have been mystery, there was half said lines. Where there should have been epiphany, there was apathy. And the point at which there should have been a profound sense of justice, there was lack of surprise and tired, overused, one liners. A third of the way into this film I was bored. Towards the end I simply had a very mild curiosity about how it would finish out.\n\nThe only real compliment I can give this movie is, the well choreographed fight scenes featuring Jason Statham. But to tell you the truth, I think he's done better work in his other films myself.\n\nSo in short, if you wish to see a really bad film. Or perhaps you are really incredibly bored. Quite frankly, I would say watch something else. This wasn't worth the time it took to watch. Much less the slot on my Netflix schedule."

Summation: The visuals and fight scenes were great, John Rhys-Davies sucketh never, the directing and writing were awful, but it makes up for it's sins by giving a lot of sincere young film students a bit of practice and a toe in the door."

For the first time, I was almost impressed by the movie; not just the amount of money wasted, or the number of otherwise-decent actors inexplicably recruited into it, but the actual story and execution.\n\nWhile watching, I couldn't help but feel that there was a good movie here, hidden underneath the satirically inept directing and bafflingly awkward dialogue. It's as though Uwe Boll would periodically say, \"People, the movie is coming along far too well; everyone do something stupid for a scene or two. Can't go raising everybody's expectations of me.\" Despite the Uwe Boll trademarks of stilted dialogue, poor character development, and generally murky storytelling, the movie was entertaining and well-paced. Almost despite the directing, the plot had some semblance of logic, and none of the actors were particularly horrible.\n\nDon't get me wrong; it's not a good movie by any normal criteria, and has a host of problems. The point here is that, for Uwe Boll, this is fantastically good.\n\nWith a little polish, and a better dialogue writer, this would have made a solid, entertaining high-budget B-movie, the kind that summer blockbusters and popcorn nights on the couch at home are made of."

I suppose Boll has his own little obsession with Lord of the Rings , every shot in the movie looks like its been stolen from the trilogy of the rings. The Krugs or whatever they are called are a miserable attempt to look like Orcs. Gallian's domain also tries to look like its Mordor but also fails miserably. The worst of all were those female forest warriors who remind you of the Elves but stupidly are swinging about like tarzan and while doing it they have this silly pose you expect peter pan to have and not the elves.\n\nI always hated Uwe boll movies but this one takes the prize. Why do they keep letting him direct this stuff? Its not like Hollywood is running out of good scripts and good directors.\n\nDon't watch it.

The only thing missing is his half winded giggle.\n\nMatthew Lillard - Imports his persona from the first Scream movie.\n\nRay Liotta - I don't know where he tapped into to get ready for this role but it was simply ridiculous to watch. Ray, I know Saruman, I've worked with Saruman and Ray you are no Saruman.\n\nJohn Rhys Davies - Actually the only actor to give a decent performance in this movie. I think the only reason he signed on was to give it some credibility following his success from Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe costumes weren't too bad but the getup that Ray Liotta had was just nothing short of idiotic. He looked like a wanna be Liberace. I half expected him to start playing the piano as he described his plans to his captives.\n\nSome of the dialogue was half-assed as well. In one of the scenes towards the beginning, I heard something like \"C'mon over here\". I swear I almost expected that phrase to end with Dude. The mishmash of accents or lack thereof was pretty horrid too.\n\nOverall if you are masochistic and want to see a movie that tries hard to be LOTR meets LOST then you will not be disappointed."

These are working actors - Ron Perlman openly admitted he's just trying to get his kids through school.\n\nDear lord, does this movie stink. The worst thing IS the casting. Individually, all of these actors have their strengths. Liotta and Statham are superb in modern urban situations. But as, respectively, an evil wizard and a medieval FARMER!?! Really? I thought Liotta was gonna pop an aorta, he was EMOTING so hard. Burt Reynolds should never play anything but versions of his own wisecracking self, and he is cast as a king - a medieval king. Experienced character actors like Perlman and Rhys-Davies come off the best, because they can play anyone in any time period. But still, given the execrable script, even they manage to suck at times. I've never seen such tone-deaf casting and writing in my life, and remember, I've seen Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus. If you value your time and your sanity, stay FAR away from his movie. Me, I'm just glad to help my man Ron's kids get through school."

So I came into this not expecting too much. And, truth be told, this movie is bad, but not horrible, surprisingly enough. It is genuinely enjoyable at times, in a dumb sort of way. Jason Statham is a surprisingly good fit, though Ron Perlman was merely okay, which I though was somewhat weird. I expected it to be the other way around. Most of the fight scenes are pretty cool, though the end could have been a lot better, in my opinion. There are plenty of silly little things that make no sense at all (ninjas? What?) but ultimately, everything sorta pans out into an enjoyable, stupid film. This is far from a masterpiece, but it's certainly closer than Alone in the Dark. Maybe this means Uwe Boll is growing as a director? I hope so."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on a popular video game, \"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\" is merely the latest in a long line of sword-and-sorcery epics set in an enchanted Medieval world populated by evil wizards, a race of mutant warriors (here called the Krug) and characters with names like Gallian, Norrick and Bastian. It also features a reluctant warrior hero by the name of Farmer (Jason Statham) who is forced to give up his pacifist ways after the dastardly Krug - and the sorcerer who telepathically controls them - kill his son and kidnap his wife.\n\n\"In the Name of the King\" may seem novel and exciting to anyone who hasn't already immersed himself in the glories of the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, but for the rest of us, the film is little more than an awkward mix of sentimentality and low comedy, punctuated by endless uber-violent battle sequences. Moreover, the acting styles range wildly in caliber and tone. Ray Liotta and Matthew Lillard are all flamboyant mannerisms and hambone line-readings as the evil sorcerer and the king's callow nephew, respectively, while Statham treats the whole thing with a gravity and seriousness worthy of a \"Becket.\" Similarly, as the magus to the king, John Rhys-Davies delivers his lines as if he were giving a command performance in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of \"Hamlet.\" At least Burt Reynolds, who exercises some restraint in his performance, avoids unduly embarrassing himself as the king.\n\nThere's no denying that the look of the film is often jaw-dropping and spectacular, filled with mist-shrouded landscapes and vistas of computer-generated armies stretching as far as the eye can see, but that is just about the only compliment one can pay to the movie."

In The Name Of The King is quite a case, because despite the director's reputation, I dare say that this movie is good and it's the most decent thing that Boll has done. It's a simple medieval story, but quite acceptable. Jason Statham is the face of the film and is what keeps it moving. Actually the cast is not bad at all. Ray Liotta plays a rather clich\u00e9d but subtle villain. The action scenes, production, and special effects are also pretty good. At least Boll did know how to do something right with the big budget invested in this film. What if, with a few tweaks and more inclusion of fantastical creatures, this would have been an excellent epic adventure. The fidelity to the original video game is something that I will not take into account, since it is a video game that I am completely unaware of. The reality is that In The Name Of The King is not a bad movie and being a movie that has Jason Statham in it, it clearly deserves some recognition. My final rating for this movie is 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Uwe Boll has earned a reputation over the past few years as being considered as the Ed Wood of 2000. For a director who has made movies, mostly about video games, every video game he has touched has been ruined. The video game, if it had any strong points, has fallen, because the movie that bases itself on that game means nothing to anybody. Of course, I have watched Uwe Boll's movies, and have deeply regretted to waste time on such a venture. Will this movie be the final nail in the coffin? You'd be surprised, but this movie is good as average schlock.\n\nIn the Name of the King is a supposed chapter based off the Dungeon Siege video games, although, I haven't played the game, so it makes me question just how close to the video game it's basing itself off of. This story follows Farmer (Jason Statham), a man in a little village, who lives with his wife (Claire Forlani) and his son, along with one of his good friends, Norick (Ron Perlman), who we find, had found him as a child, and brought him to the village he lives in today. A war involving two sides, King Konreid (Burt Reynolds) and Gallian (Ray Liotta) is about to arise. When Krug attacks the Village that Farmer lives in, a race of beasts with human like characteristics, He realizes that his family might be in danger too. With his wife kidnapped and son murdered, Farmer takes up arms in an attempt to find Gallian and kill him, as always in fantasy movies.\n\nNow for the criticism part. This movie isn't \"Lord of the Rings\"; it's not even \"Lord of the Rings\" Lite. It's like watching \"Dungeons and Dragons\" the movie, with Jason Statham and Matthew Lillard (Shaggy from Scooby Doo has an appearance in a serious role, but it's not too serious, trust me.) fighting in the background.\n\nNow to say D&D is a better movie would be an insult to an otherwise lackluster movie. Does that make sense? Uwe Boll has made a movie that is in essence, Power Rangers (The Krug make me think of the Putties from the 90's Power Rangers series) with Fantasy Lore (Mystical Forests, magic abilities, swords and archers) and rather crappy acting, but you have to admit, even \"Conan the Barbarian\" or \"Beast Master\" had all these little touches to it as well.\n\nI tried to compare this to Peter Jackson's \"The Lord of the Rings\", and it failed miserably. The Editing sucks, the plot is rather average, the CGI is okay, the fighting is long, and about 1000 points under the fight sequences to LOTR's fight sequences, and the acting is silly, but every fantasy film compared to LOTR is going to become rather lame, because LOTR is a far better film than most movies already, especially fantasy movies. If you don't look at the director for one second and his crappy reputation, you have a mild, watch once and be done with it, Fantasy Movie.\n\nFor that I give it a six out of ten. It's a double-edged sword when you show liking to a movie like this, but it is an okay movie. Compared to all the other movies he has done, it's better than all he has ever touched. That doesn't mean I'm ready to sign the petition to let him continue movie making."

Don't count on it. I'll even give you the fact that Burt Reynolds plays the King. Good old Burt couldn't even save this one. I think the budget was spent on the cast and special effects so there was little left for a script, let alone to hire a decent director.\n\nThe special effects are pretty incredible. The battle scenes are well choreographed and the music isn't half bad but then you find scenes like the one with Kristanna Loken as Elora, a vine swinging tough chick who declares that men are not welcome in her forest and has the screen presence of a stick.\n\nRay Liotta gets the biggest laughs as he tries desperately to be the insane baddie. I just couldn't take him seriously and I am not sure he could, either. Maybe he needed the money? To my surprise the saving grace of this whole fiasco is Matthew Lillard (\"Scream\") who shines as the sniveling, traitorous, Duke Fallow. Yes, he plays it over the top, but in a snooze fest of performances, Lillard can't help but shine."

The lighting was atrocious, no grading to add depth. Special fx weren't that spacial. The script was well lets just say a room of monkeys could do better.

The worst part was the mains are all decent actors to begin with so this must have been directing that failed them.\n\nOh well at least I didn't pay money to see this. haven't seen the ending yet and doubt I ever will, as I have no desirer to finish this steaming pile Of sh#t. Uwe Boll please oh please do us all a favor and stop making films, even the worst films out of film school are leaps and bounds above your's. Uwe Boll I know you think you can direct but I wouldn't let you direct traffic. don't watch this film unless you have to."

I have read several of the reviews on here and while I can tell some of the folks are joking with their high ratings, some are not.

Nothing else good can i say. I began flipping scenes to get it over with faster. I would suggest sticking with lord of the rings at least that was done right. There is only one other movie as bad as this one \"Fools Gold\" If you want to watch the story just play the video game the plot is better and so is the acting."

The movie had no flow, and seemed to jump from scene to scene randomly. I urge you not to watch this movie to see how bad it is, because I assure you it really IS the worst movie you will ever watch. Uwe Boll is a disgrace to humanity. I have no idea what on earth was going through Jason Statham, and the rest of the excellent cast's heads, because Uwe Boll has shown time and time again that he has no regard or respect for the source material of every single one of his D-grade movies (which he has many of). Simply watching this movie will cause you to lose braincells"

It suffers from everything any B-movie does: sub-par acting, cheesy special effects, cameos by famous people obviously in the hopes of making the film seem more credible, and so on.\n\nHowever; as a B-movie, this thing is pretty good. Nothing new, nothing groundbreaking, nothing epic, but definitely something to watch. The fight scenes are reminiscent of old-school '90s karate movies, and are decently choreographed. The story, while delivered with all that lovely B-movie cheese, it rather well crafted (even if Boll makes a few holes here and there), and I found it surprisingly entertaining.\n\nReally what I'm trying to say here is Uwe Boll is not as bad a director as I had initially thought. I am a rather large fan of B-movies, and before this flick I was ready to hang Uwe by his Bolls for his previous atrocities. Now I see him in a new light. He is not, by any stretch of the imagination, the next Wes Anderson or David Cronenberg, but neither is he the Michael Bay of the B-movie set (not anymore anyway)."

It starts with a Lord Of The Rings graphical touch, you can almost see the Hobbits coming... then it turns into Gladiator, almost to a complete rip-off, even the music, then it plunges into Star Wars when you can almost hear \"I am your father, Luke\"... so nothing new at all, which isn't always really a problem if all the rest of the movie makes up for it, but nope. Here we have dreadful unprofessional editing combined with what must have been bad directing (since the actors seem competent from their prior work I'm familiar with) and a boring story. The special effects are decent, but some bad transitions manage to spoil them too.\n\nOverall one of the least enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time.

Furthermore,some of the dialog doesn't work but a lot of it is intentionally laugh outload funny.The stunts are often terrific especially the one where Statham fights while riding under a horse.It is as good as legendary stuntman Yakama Kannuk in a old Three Mesquiteers western.Wow!

Everything was simply predictable and so much didn't fit here or there. Let's start from the beginning, shall we? In the first few minutes of the movie, it wasn't that bad. Despite the lack of motivation from the actors/actresses to actually act, I was somewhat surprised by the \"fun\" feeling I get from bad movies. However, that soon changed when the first battle with the LOTR orc-lookalikes attacked and started to raise hell. It was like watching an episode right out of Hercules: The Legendary Journey, except there was no Kevin Sorbo. Everything from that point on was below average and just dull. The acting, the fighting, the music was way out of place and overused at some times, and the editing was TERRIBLE. I tried watching it as much as I could, but about half-way through began speeding it up every few minutes to see what happen next. In the end, it was just another bad movie.\n\nNow, moving away from the cons about this movie, there are some pros I did like about it. Some of the special effects were actually pretty cool and some of the fighting wasn't that bad with Jason doing his usual kick-kick-strike-kick-kick-strike combo like in Transporter. These are the only reasons I'm not giving it a 1 because Jason is an awesome guy who simply got screwed into making this movie. Not just him either, but every actor/actress in this movie was at some point somebody I loved, yet was TERRIBLY miscast. I sympathize with their situation and hope this doesn't hurt their careers in the long run, besides the has-beens.\n\nOverall, this is just another bad Boll movie. It doesn't even come close to being average and looks like a LOTR rip-off rather than some video game adaptation. I no longer have the slightest hope that Uwe will actually do something good in his future. STOP GIVING HIM LICENSES TO MAKE THESE MOVIES!"

Ray Liotta was very disappointing in this movie. i mean the others seemed to at least try. John Rhys-Davies was good as always, and surprisingly so was Ron Perlman. i mean he was great in beauty and the beast (the TV series), but I've never much liked him in anything else. here he seemed to have found a role he could play with, and i liked him in it. Matthew Lillard was excellent as always though he has become so typecast, and now appearing in a Uwe Boll film, its not a good move in my opinion for his career\n\nbut basically, unless like me, you're a die hard Jason Statham fan, don't bother, i saw it for free, and i want my money back. it was that bad.\n\nrock on Uwe, your record for truly being a horrid storyteller stands strong :)"

I'd never seen a Jason Statham movie before and while I wasn't blown away, the guy is good in action scenes. He also appears to channel Bruce Willis and Steven Seagall as far as talking in a whisper to appear tough. Oh, well. I know Uwe Boll is derided as the anti-Christ, but come on, this was good stuff. the photography, music and pace were all good.\n\nThe story is about a man named Farmer, who has a wife who loves him nd a little boy who adores him. He lives off the land and just wasn't to be left alone, no such luck! an evil wizard named Gallian, well-played by Ray Liotta, has unleashed the Krug, beasts that fight like men. They raze his village and kill his young son and in-laws!! Whew, shades of Conan or Beastmaster! Daunted but unyielding Farmer sets off with his friends to see if his wife might have survived. Ron Perlman is really good here.\n\ngoing on at the same time is the Gallian's seduction of Muriella, a much better than usual Leelee Sobieski, who looks gorgeous in this. Her father is the king's mage, the always welcome John Rhys-Davies (from TLOTR!!) and King Konried, Burt Reynolds of all people, is being betrayed by his slimy nephew, played by Matthew Lillard. initially I thought Lillard was miscast here, but apparently the part is supposed to be humorous, so he did a good job too.\n\nI like the part in the forest with Farmer when he runs amok with the elvish women who live there, Kristanna Loken is one of them, what a babe! And I like the rescue of Farmer's wife and the revelation about his lineage. OK, you could see it coming ,but so what?\n\nI like this move, the special effects were good, the action fierce and you could really root for the hero. There is depth here, not everyone makes it without being scarred, beat up or outright killed, which was refreshing. The ending is a little abrupt, but people complained it was too long so... Overall I think this is a good flick, much better than the two Dungeons and Dragons movies. Check it out for yourself, you might be pleasantly surprised."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie market is full of movies based on video games. I even dare to say that practically all the most popular games have already known a film adaptation, from \"Super Mario\" to \"Angry Birds\". I've seen quite a few of them, and so far I haven't found one that I could say I liked. Or rather, what I can remember right now...\n\nI don't know the game \"Dungeon Siege\", but from what I saw in a quick search on the Internet it must be very similar to other games of the pseudo-medieval genre. Wicked kings, dungeons and sorcerers are part of this universe. They are fantasy, intended to stimulate the imagination and thirst for action of those who have never picked up a real medieval sword.\n\nDirected by Uwe Bol, a director I didn't know until now, and of whom I have not very recommendable references (but let's not, because of that, judge in advance!), the film I've just seen is relatively pleasant, and is based on a struggle for power in a kingdom called Ehb. On one side we have a wicked sorcerer and the late king's nephew, who wants to reign in his place, and on the other we have a poor farmer, at the head of an unlikely revolution. We've seen a lot of this, medieval themed films are always exploring these themes.\n\nWhile originality is lacking here, the film works reasonably well and isn't as bad as some have claimed. There are far worse things floating around between big lauds. All right, the film lacks a more effective direction and a greater epic sense, much of what you see has already been done in other better films and the characters are sketches without personality. But considering that the movie is based on a game, I think a decent effort was made.\n\nThe cast has several big names. For me, the best and most competent is Ray Liotta, who really makes an effort to raise the quality of what he does with the poor material he receives and manages to steal our attention whenever he appears on the scene. However, I also liked Ron Perlman and John Rhys-Davies. I didn't like Jason Statham, he seems to be in the movie just for the pay, and the rest of the cast has little or little time to do something.\n\nTechnically, the film deserves praise for its excellent cinematography, the good shooting options and the chosen locations. The soundtrack harmoniously unites an excellent original soundtrack and several hard rock themes that appear more during the credits, and stays in the ear for some time."

        "review_detailed_main": "While not one of the greatest movies I ever seen, it definitely wasn't the worst. Considering the bashing Uwe Boll gets I was expecting the movie to be a travesty along the lines of Blood Rayne, so I had very low expectations and was surprised. While it definitely could have been better with more effects and if the story had been drawn out and shown in a more epic way, like LotR or something similar it, it was passable. The story was decent, although rushed! The actors did a decent job with very little time to develop character depth. I do admit I am glad I didn't go to the theaters to see ItNofK, but it is a good rent. After playing the game, which I enjoy, I was disappointed that there wasn't more to it than what we got. Considering the other VG movies that have been made this is definitely a few steps up, but still along ways from the standard that it could have been with the story and history that the game already has. While I wasn't disappointed and did enjoy the movie I wasn't greatly impressed. Better than some of his other movies, but some nice improvements would be character development and a plot that doesn't move at light speed."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can say I have grown as Boll has grown seeing all of his video game adapted films in theaters. I saw the terrible acting and decent action of House of the Dead, the lackluster plot(but progress) of Alone in the Dark, and finally the underrated and horribly businesses handled BloodRayne. So now here is In The Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale... and what do I think? Uwe Boll seems to be only baby steps away from becoming a solid \"B\" rate movie director, writer, producer, etc and this movie shows it. First off, the visuals through out show that Uwe Boll actually can control and emphasis his points on what he wants to do with the camera. The same plague seems to haunt Boll though. Poor conversations between the actors and terrible editing. The writing for this has gotten better, I still think BloodRayne was the best out of the 4, but the editing, especially in the beginning, is choppy. Now how about the acting? All over the place would be easiest way to say. Burt Reynolds as the King is off but I think everyone was cast well it's just that I don't think Uwe gets it or has yet to emphasis that vision as he has improved basically everything else. The music fits the mood, but how about the action you wonder? Solid through out just like his previous efforts. The ending is a bit weak and a little rushed it seems, but if there is two things I can't complain it is the visual work and the action scenes.\n\nOverall Boll created a film that killed my 2hrs and was worth admission. I can easily name a lot worse films that have released probably just in December.\n\nI think he is making the proper steps and I expect he will use a lot of what he learned to make Tunnel Rats a solid film."

        "review_title": "Uwe Boll does 'Lord of the Rings' and fails once again",
        "review_detailed_main": "Apart from the fact that we know Uwe Boll as being one of the worst directors of all-time, we also know him due to the fact that he likes to copy the likeness of other films ( That are actually successful ) in a blatant rip-off kind of fashion. He has many times ripped off the Matrix with many hilariously terrible slow motion sequences and has copied Alien a few times with his design and name for monsters. It seems now it is Lord of the Ring's turn to be made a fool of.\n\nFor some unknown reason i cannot quite put my finger on Uwe Boll keeps being able to cast grade A actors like Burt Reynolds, Ron Perlman, John Rhys Davies & Ray Liotta. However, this is combined with absolutely horrible B movie actors such as Matthew Lillard ( Yeah, Scream was an exception ) and the horrendous Will Sanderson, of which the latter is in nearly every one of Boll's films. It is a weird combination of great and terrible actors and it doesn't work. None of the grade A actors deliver a convincing performance in the film except for possibly John Rhys Davies. However, none of them seem to be truly touched by the 'Boll' syndrome of acting. It seems more like these great actors could not convince anyone because of the poor script, Spouting out lines no actor could have said convincingly such as: 'Life.... has never been more exciting!!'. It does mean, however, that this is one of Boll's better films ( Or shall we say, 'least bad'? ) because of the fact the acting is ever so slightly less terrible than a lot of his previous efforts. I still have to mention that performances like Matt Lillard's, Will Sanderson's & Leelee Sobieski's in this film are still absolutely atrocious and beyond the concept of 'horrible'.\n\nJason Statham is, as always, Jason Statham. That unfazed dead eyed rock of masculinity. Unfortunately, this is a role that requires some emotional depth, and the scene where Statham is burying his son is laughable due to Statham's performance because he shows absolutely no emotion whatsoever. Once again, i get that Statham is supposed to be this tough guy that is too 'cool' for crying, but this moment really makes his character cease to be human. Was Maximus in Gladiator a wimp? No, he was the definition of cinema 'masculinity', but what did he do when he saw his wife and son dead? He gave an extended sob fest which is exactly what every human being would do at this sight no matter what your personalities are. It made him human, and it never felt out of character for a minute. Ofcourse Statham doesn't have any emotional range, so he could never have pulled off a scene like that, but it does make you wonder about this horrendous casting. Let us also not forget the hilariously wooden responses of both Sobieski & Sanderson after seeing a loved one die. There is not an ounce of emotion in their faces at all during these scenes.\n\nThere are too many obvious greenscreens in the wideshots. Especially one in particular with Burt Reynolds setting out with a small army outside his castle has terrible CGI and special effects, which is also one of Boll's trademarks. Some of the side shots of this sequence seem to be filmed on location without CGI, and the visual change between edits in this scene are just ridiculous. Also let us not forget to mention that a couple of particular catapult 'firebombs' also look like absolute garbage. The lighting is many times much too bright and the sets look obviously artificial.\n\nThe enemies in are 'Krugs', which might aswell have been called 'Orcs', because this seems like a blatant Lord of the Rings ripoff. Gallian ( Ray Liotta ) is the villain. We do not know why he is the villain, but he is the villain. His motivations or reasonings for his actions are never shown. It looks like Henry Hill entered a multi dimensional time machine and ended up in a fantasy medieval world, which really goes to show how miscast Liotta was.\n\nAction sequences are a bit better than a lot of Boll's previous films but there is still loads of quick cutting and shakycam action going on. It is still a difficult task to tell what is going on during a fight sequence. The film doesn't really have a narrative, and there are a lot of these extended fight sequences that take up the entire runtime, so the lacking choreography and mediocre editing really does become even more noticeably as time goes by.\n\nIn the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale has poor and wooden acting, a terrible script with horrendous dialogue and many blatant LOTR ripoffs, ( A lot of the still frames look like ugly & cheap copies of the beautiful stills of LOTR ), terrible characters & ugly production values. Even though as stated before the acting is wooden ( Particularly when friends or family of characters die ), performances of John Rhys Davies do still shine a little bit and in combination with its scale and the pretty decent music it is still one of Boll's greatest efforts. ( Which is saying little. )"

As for Jason statham, his role was alright,as mean as ever when he speaks or plays fight scenes. As for john Reyes Davis,at least his composure in the film was more dramatic than the rest. Matthew lilliard somehow could not fit the role of a evil nephew. He should stick to scream series. All in all this film was a cast off for lord of the rings,using scope for large armies like L.O.T.R. yet it did make up for good special effects in the magic department. I have to say that was a good relief,something lotr hardly had as magic went. But i still love lord of the rings much more. As for the game it had more drama than this movie,using more profound character development than the movie. Although the background scenes were very good,some areas i did not recognize,which was good. It kept me guessing where they filmed most of the movie. But for my view it did not do anything for me. not a bad side trip from the usual drivel we see,but not fully entertaining. i hope they have better luck next time around."

I saw other people saying : \" In dungeon siege u start as a Farmer and what did Uwe Boll think lets name the main character Farmer\", or at least something like that, the fact is that it is explained at the beginning of the movie why they called him Farmer, it was popular in those ages that a man would be called by his craftsmanship, Blacksmiths where usually called by that name, and not many ppl gave importance to what their real name was. About the story, it's pretty much classic, girls gets in love with the wrong guy, a traitor relative, a lost son of the king, bla,bla,bla.... But it is well put on screen and that is what counts, it is pretty predictable but it is not boring, and it has it's funny moments some times. So overall i think this movie is above average. So my advise watch the movie, and don't judge the movie, just because it is made by Uwe Boll, this one is really good."

Lillard's simply a comedy guy... and not a very good one! Reynolds was perhaps the single best cast role in the film, was very \"Kingly\" despite some scripting problems. Finally, all I can think of when I see Pearlman anymore is.. Hellboy!\n\nThat all being said. Was it a 10? Definitely not. Is it worth a rent? I would say yes, if you're looking for an action flick that you don't have to analyze. The acting could have had better direction. I can only assume it was lack of direction, as most of the big actors in this film have turned out some stellar work. I've seen a lot worse come out of film-city recently. Stop comparing it to LOTR and enjoy it for what it is, an action movie based on a video game.\n\n5.6 out of 10 (Had to round it up on the rating system here)\n\nCasting: 4 - Simply too many actors, from too many different backgrounds\n\nActing: 5 - Could have been worse, could have been better\n\nCinematography: 7 - Great scenery, brought down by bad direction.\n\nPlot: 5 - I give credit for not remaking another film, but it simply has an overly \"written\" script.\n\nCostume Design: 7 - The \"Krug\" were pretty bad, but everything else brings this score up a lot."

I guess I should have known better, but I didn't. Regardless, when I was watching the previews before the movie, and I saw the trailer for his upcoming debacle known as \"Postal\", I knew I was doomed.\n\nUwe Boll is a horrible, horrible person. Why he intentionally punishes the movie-going audience with garbage like this is beyond me.\n\nI recall reading in \"X-Box Magazine\" a quote from an interview he did. Boll basically went on about how he was angering everyone in the video game community, and how he would continue to make horrible movies just to show people that their opinions don't matter to him, including a 3-picture deal that included \"Postal\".\n\nWhy? Why would you intentionally want to aggravate so many people, especially when it costs money to make these horrible films, and you end up losing money when so few people see them? Even with these movies for sale on DVD, I can guarantee they're not selling. I have seen copies of \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"House of the Dead\" in $5.00 dump bins at Wal-Mart, and even then, they don't sell.\n\nPeople are calling Uwe Boll the \"Modern Day Ed Wood\", and while that is fitting, I'd almost say it's actually an insult to Ed Wood. Yes, Wood made horrible films, but I don't think he was such an arrogant jerk about it.\n\nI mean, making movies just to tick people off. What kind of issues can a guy have to do that?"

The cgi was stunning for the most part (admittedly, there were a couple of bits that could have used a touch of refinement), and the action sequences were quite well choreographed. I was definitely surprised at such a large, well-known cast of heavy hitters, all of whom put in a good performance (though I don't think any of them will be getting awards for this film.) Jason Statham is one of my current favorite actors, and I find that he did a great job in a non-modern piece. Give it a try, go see it once, and don't hold the bar too high. It's a good film, just don't expect it to be great."

I say, get her out of the pit pronto. A good-looking girl would surely befit a good-looking movie, and good-looking it is. With the help of drifting dust, changing light and twinkling stars (both heavenly and human), producer-director Uwe Boll and cinematographer Mathias Neumann have created an atmospheric epic that keeps viewers engaged front to back. The tree-dwelling forest elves with sometime Terminatrix Kristanna Loken in the part of saucy elf queen Elora are my personal favorites. I recommend the sequel explore her fling with the magician's daughter (Leelee Sobieski) in more detail. Fine performances by Jason Statham as the not-so-reluctant warrior and Matthew Lillard as his well-oiled rival. All in all, a lot better than expected."

This is beyond that level of terrible into a whole new category worse than the absolute worst of Syfy original movies. Spare your eyes and watch something else.

Some people just trash his movies sight unseen because they hate him so. I honestly tried to give Boll the benefit of the doubt and give this movie a chance, but I was still disappointed. I have nephews who still watch Power Rangers movies and this movie just felt like one of those movies.\n\n\"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\" (too long) had the most potential to be a good movie. It has some talented actors in it, as well as Burt Reynolds. It seemed to have a reasonable budget and a competent set, props and costume department. The music is okay, too. What went wrong? The story and the direction and the acting. Much of that falls into Boll's responsibility.\n\nFor starters, the pacing is just boring. I just found myself bored and didn't care what was going on. The characters are all flat and uninteresting. I'm not sure there was much of a plot because stuff just seemed to happen on screen for no particular reason. The fight scenes were no better than what I've seen in stuff like the Power Rangers, or Xena. I've seen better from low budget TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\n\nAll of the acting is flat. It's like a table reading with people just saying their lines. We could blame the actors (and they take some of the blame), but actors are shaped by the director and Boll asks nothing of his actors.\n\nThis whole movies was nothing but a paycheck to everyone involved. No one cared about it, so we shouldn't either."

Despite the fact that I think he's a straight forward guy and I like his attitude ('I like what I do and earn my living so blow me'), he misses some important things to be taken more seriously:\n\nI just don't get it. How does Uwe Bolls keep getting these actors in his movies. While Christian Slater, Ben Kingsley and Michael Madsen have featured in his previous movies, ITNOTK has the following cast:\n\nJason Statham as the London bloke trapped in a fantasy world, Burt Reynolds as the US Sean Connery clone as in The First Knight, Ron 'Hellboy' Perlman... well, doing his cool Ron Perlman thing, Ray Liotta in a ... Ray-Las-Vegas-Liotta-magician kinda role, with corresponding haircut, Matt 'Shaggy' Lillard as the kings retarded nephew, and hottie Claire Forlani as the MILF\n\nSo that's the lineup... impressive huh? So what about the movie?\n\nWell, the monsters were a bit crappy, the backgrounds and environments looked pretty good, 3d effects were decent, but nothing we haven't seen before. Too bad you can't say the same about the screenplay... what a mess.\n\nThe story is very choppy, too many scenes in the movie were completely useless. Over-dramatic acting with the wrong actors make it very unbalanced and unbelievable. The correct timing could have make this movie a lot better.\n\nThe action scenes are terrible: it's clear that every scene is built up of 40 shots pasted together. It's like they're not even trying to fit the shots seamlessly. off course Jason Statham and Ron Perlman can kick some serious ass, but the mix of martial arts and swordplay make it too modern.\n\nThe thing that bugged me the most were the mix of American English and UK English and ... the Ninjas.\n\nDid you just say Ninjas? Yes, Ninjas my friend... What has Uwe been smoking when he thought of that?\n\nAll together, the movie was fun to watch but could have been a lot better. My wife didn't complain about the movie so I guess this one was about the same level as The Bold and the Beautiful or As the World Turns ;)"

Many of them are well respectable and shouldn't have signed up to do this film (Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Claire Forlani, Leelee Sobieski, Ron Rerlman). In general 'In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale' is just a boring film with rip-offs from The Lord of the Rings. The characters were boring and bland, the fight scenes were bad directed, and the dialogue was just cheesy.\n\nThe film runs at a 1hr, 55mins (excl. end credits), but it feels so much longer. I was checking my watch and the clocks quite often while watching this film waiting for it to end. The film was just boring (save for some fight scenes in the forest). Another thing that you could just tell from the start that this was going to be a bad film, is that many of the actors are speaking in different accents. Some were using American accents, while others were using old English medieval accents. Bottom line, don't waste your time watching this."

Often it seems almost comical, such as when Farmer is saving his two mates from the river.\n\nUnfortunately, as the score distracts, it is least present at times when it would be nice to be distracted by the poor acting. Look at the credits and you won't expect much acting, but most of the lines are delivered as if they're being read for the first time and the actors don't really know where the story is going. Sometimes it sounds like they ad lib, like saying \"What the hell does that mean?\" in such a colloquial way, just after asking with great feeling \"What games are the gods playing with me?\" and getting a response that sounds creatively zen.\n\nThe effects of course aren't special. They pale next to movies of the same era. This is all about budget of course, so I won't criticize too much. Much can be done with little, given the right eye for the look of the scenes, and these scenes stage very well, even if they look like castoffs from the Lord of the Rings prop department.\n\nThe story isn't very interesting, the acting isn't very interesting, and the filming isn't very exciting. Overall, it's only of interest to devoted fans of a.) any of the leads, just to complete the chore of watching all their respective works; b.) the fantasy-action genre in general, although this only moderately qualifies as either or c.) movies that are bad in the not- laughable way.\n\nP.S. I find it interesting that IMDb suggests that I might also like movies with much shorter names such as Avatar, Willow and Beowulf. I guess they figure once I've read the unnecessarily long name of this movie I'd be glad for a movie I could talk about."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have heard a lot about how Uwe Boll is the absolute worst filmmaker in the world. I have read how he deserves to never be allowed near any camera and have seen endless assault on him online and other sources. I have had no interest in watching any of his film except that this one was on and there wasn't anything else I that piqued my interest. I had expected it to be bad but I have to admit I've seen worst as a matter of fact the last movie I saw before this, \"Delta Farce\" was even worst.\n\nThe movie was supposed to be based on the video game \"Dungeon Siege\", there by itself is a clue as to where it first went wrong. For the life of me I could never understand the desire of any movie producer to make a movie based on a game. It just seem like a bad idea. It's even worse when there's no attempt to make a good movie. This film unfortunately does not even try. There seem to be an idea to just follow a story laid out already. No reason for the actions, no character development, very little background development.\n\nThe main problem with this film of course is the script. It just basically plunge us into the action without explanation. I know that the wizard or magi Galien wants to take over a kingdom and we have no explanation as to why other than it's land and that he wants it. We also have no explanation as to how he made alliances inside the kingdom just brief hints at what his allies really wants. The dialogue is cheesy and there are used of phrases and words that absolutely did not belong in a Medieval sword and sorcery film. I mean they were using modern colloquialism like \"Don't be so melodramatic\". It just doesn't work.\n\nAlso the characters are underdeveloped. They all are just one dimensional characters that basically just exist to do their deeds on this movie. They're not really characters that you think about after the movie is finished neither are they characters you could really care about. They're about as transparent as can be. There are no surprises in what they're going to do or how they're going to act. They are what they are.\n\nThe acting is mixed, the older actors at least gave it a try. John Rhys Davies has done numerous of these horrible B and C grade movies and remains professional, so has Ron Perlman. neither just recite their lines you can see in their eyes that there's something behind them. Burt Reynolds on the other hand just gave up after a few scenes, he was good in a few scenes then it seems as if he just fell asleep. Leelee Sobieski is just not a good actress neither is Matthew Lillard. Jason Statham is a martial artist and you don't expect them to be good actors, he's almost as bad as Steven Seagal. Claire Forlani and Ray Liotta did what they could and it makes you wonder how their careers can sink so low. Mr. Liotta had an auspicious beginning appearing in \"Goodfellas\" and Miss Forlani had appeared with Brad Pitt and was on her way to bigger and better things. Both could use new agents.\n\nAs for Mr. Boll's directing his camera work was not bad at all, I would have to say that some of the action sequences moved a little slower than you expect from a film like this. I don't know Mr. Boll's background I would suspect that he was a music video or television commercial director. He knows how to handle the hardware but he knows absolutely nothing about story telling or creating characters. To top it all I don't think he knows how to work with actors."

Leelee Sobieski was decent, John Rhys Davies and Ron Perlman all did pretty well with their roles. On the other hand, Burt Reynolds, Matt Lillard, and Ray Liotta were so terrible, it almost made me weep.\n\nOK, so apart from the horrendous acting, there are many other terrible things about this movie. The costumes and sets were pretty bad. The costumes of the enemy, the \"Krug,\" (this is the noise people make while vomiting during this movie) could have passed off for the Putty Patrol from the original Power Rangers. I actually flinched every time I saw someone walking on the sets, unsure if they could hold the actors weight. They looked like a middle school, shop class project. The musical scores for this movie actually upset my stomach. They are mostly done by a string orchestra, and sound almost the same throughout the entire movie. It's not so much music as it is noise, and the noise is close to the sound of nails on a chalkboard. There were so many things that were stolen from The Lord of the Rings movies (ehem, Gimli) that Peter Jackson is probably going to be whining and postponing his next movie because he isn't getting royalties from this one.\n\nI can't and won't recommend this movie to anyone unless Brightlight Pictures pays me to.

The worst thing I can say about this movie is that the script wasn't very good. All the actors did a fine job, the cinematics were good as well.\n\nI watch a lot of movies, and have a collection of over 400 DVD titles. This movie is no where close to the worst movies. Anyone who believes it is hasn't seen very many bad movies.\n\nI would call this movie a fun fantasy romp. Kids will love it, and anyone who is genuinely a fan of the fantasy genre will enjoy it.\n\nIt's just too bad they got The Burt to play the King, he should stick to movies like Cannonball Run, I can't say much for him as a dramatic actor. Dom Deluise would have made a better king.\n\nSome of the other reviewers on this site should get their noses out of the clouds. I would like to see them do a better job."

I just watched the movie and i simply had to comment it (i have never did it, i even had to register on this page to comment). Actors jokes (expect Statham and Reynolds, and only cool stuff were the dryads, never saw them in any movie, so it was something fresh, new and hot :)), scenery was beautiful but the cheap, unfinished plot is just killing it. I simply had to comment this movie 'cause i am so pi*sed. Would you please do me a favor and kill Uwe Boll. But slowly and very painfully. And the last thing that is breaking my ball is the terrible music! When the music is on i had to shut it down 'cause its killing me. My ears are almost bleeding from it. Its like some amateur trying to play on violin. Disgusting. I don't know who did the music to this movie but kill him as well. Thank you ..."

OK so this film wasn't Lord of the Rings, was it advertised as LOTR? Apart from John Rhyss Davies did it have any other connections with LOTR? NO! It was a completely different story. I found this film to be enjoyable, OK not Oscar material but this film was entertaining none the less. The characters were good, and completely in line with the Game. The whole film felt like Dungeon Siege. I have played the game and completed it, and I can say that Uwe has captured that feel in the movie. The cinematography is very good, especially where Merricks daughter is riding away from the Duke. This film also has a kicking soundtrack, some great actors, and its a lot of fun to watch. The only bad thing about the film is Matthew Lillard, he hammed up his role the way only he can, he should be shot! If you want an entertaining film that will delight the family this is it, if your after a multiple Oscar winning film (The voting was rigged!) then watch LOTR. I will have to find more Uwe Boll films now, as after watching Alone in the Dark the other night I am becoming a fan of his work."

First the cast is a pretty dang good one, how this continues to happen is beyond me although this is probably the best cast he's assembled. Too bad some of them are so miscast is terrible. Matthew Lillard anyone? Embarrassing to say the least. Second the story is just terrible and pointless beyond measure. Last but not least the execution of all of it is some of the worse stuff I've ever seen. If fact this is as bad, if not worse than the Sci-fi Channels original movies but with a much larger budget. At least Uwe will have a harder time now that the German tax loophole he exploited so well is no longer around. Here's hoping he never makes any more movies."

        "review_title": "\"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\" is Uwe Boll's most mediocre film yet!",
        "review_detailed_main": "I'm going into this review with honesty- I have only seen about two-thirds of Uwe Boll's \"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\", and I'll never finish watching it. I simply have no desire to- I kept falling asleep during my previous attempts to watch it, it was so \"blah\" and uninspired! And as he demonstrated with previous atrocities against both cinema and video-games such as \"House of the Dead\" and \"BloodRayne\", director Boll once again proves he simply doesn't have a clue.\n\nEven with capable (and good) actors, and a fairly large budget of $60 million, he delivers a film that looks like it was made for TV, with lame CGI effects and atrocious-looking monsters and villains. There was some nice production design and a few cool costumes, but the cinematography and lighting really took away from them. Plus, I actually laughed out loud when the supposedly ferocious creatures arrived and attacked a village near the beginning- the monster suits the performers were wearing were pure \"Power Rangers\"- silly rubber costumes that just make the actors look like actors in costumes and not resemble anything monstrous at all.\n\nThe plot: Something about an army of creatures that is controlled by the evil Gallian, and a Farmer who goes after Gallian after his son is killed and his wife is kidnapped by his evil forces. Yeah, something along those lines, I couldn't tell you exactly, 'cause the movie put me to sleep. Although it was nice of Boll to give me an alternative to counting sheep to help me catch some \"z's\"! I should have been more suspicious when I saw the film's previews, which boasted a generic font displaying generic catch-phrases, while a generic hero delivered a generic pep-talk to generic allies.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the film has quite a talented cast, including leading man Jason Statham (of \"Transporter\" trilogy and \"Crank\" fame), Ron Perlman (\"Hellboy\" series) and even Burt Reynolds (no notation needed), with supporting roles by the likes of Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken and others. We even get Ray Liotta as the villain! In other words, the cast is great, but none of them really seems to give a darn about the film. I never had a feeling of intimacy with the characters that a viewer should feel... I just felt like I was watching people reciting lines. That's about it.\n\nI should mention Boll's direction as well- mediocre in this film, which is actually a surprising improvement over his past few films! He still can't really tell a story visually, but mediocre is a big step from where he was before, which was \"god awful.\" I suppose I could go on and on about how bad Boll's films are, but by now you should really get the picture. So I guess I'll say that while still really bad, \"In the Name of the King\" isn't Boll's worst, though it isn't his best, either. (His best, and only, decent film being the so-so drama \"Heart of America\") There are a few nice details here and there, but Boll's amateurish style and the apparent lack of charisma from anyone and everyone involved really shows through.\n\nI really can't recommend this film. It's one of Boll's better films, but that isn't really saying much. Frankly, it's just another fantasy film trying to cash in on the success of \"Lord of the Rings\" by having big battles and lots of special effects. A 4 out of 10 for me. Avoid it unless you need something that will put you to sleep."

Hardly old English verbiage with an American accent.\n\nOne of the worst films i've ever seen. BTW: During the same fight seen, you see the star actor, a fierce fighter, sprint at full steam into a horse (face first) and fall down. Horrible.\n\nWith such films as \"Transporter\" under the belt of the main lead, you would have excepted at least a decent movie. This on the other hand is a joke and I took out the DVD after just a few minutes."

Also why did they have a bunch of American actors trying to speak with horrific English accents? Couldn't they have found some underemployed British actors and at least had the accent correct? Who is Uwe Boll and why is he being allowed within 100 ft of a camera? IMDb states that this review must be a least 10-line long. This movie doesn't deserve a 10-line review, it's just that bad.

Jason Statham kicked some butt in this movie as Farmer. The ugly troll krug guys looked pretty good, and the fight scenes were very well done. I liked all the big name actors in this movie too. Burt Reynolds & Ray Liotta weren't in this movie too much though. If you enjoyed the Lord Of The Rings movies, or just like action/adventure movies you might enjoy this one. It's worth checking out and no where near as bad as everyone online is saying. I honestly don't see why people hate Uwe Boll's films.

        "review_detailed_main": "Why is it that when it comes to Uwe, people find it easier to skip the actual analysis of a movie and start throwing adjective like \"dumbest\", \"worst\", \"terrible\" and \"horrible\" around? From my point of view, I find \"In the Name of the King\" to be his best movie to date(granted I haven't yet seen House of the Dead).Of course that isn't saying much, considering the caliber of everything else he's done.\n\nI saw somebody complain about the CGI.Well it's better than in some far superior movies I've seen, and definitely above TV standards(I'll try and not think of Dungeons&Dragons:Wrath of the Dragon God).Who cares that the castle in the background is visibly CGI?It's not you would've believed it was a real castle anyway, and I doubt there are many fantasy movies that can actually boast with a realistic CGI medieval castle(not even LOTR managed to pull that off every time).\n\nSure, the plot is awful, maybe that's even an understatement, but it's Uwe, he surrounds himself with incompetence with a skill unsurpassed by anyone(I truly think, had he found a decent, capable crew of men assisting him with his movies, he would be past the 5 star mark here on IMDb).\n\nWhich brings us to the acting.Well, what can you expect from people miscast who've been handed a terrible script?Still, familiar faces sure do help with the viewing of such bad dialogue and intrigue.\n\nBurt Reynolds, why did you do it?Was it worth the money?Was the sum THAT high? Jason Statham and Ray Liotta.Well, Statham is only suited for some roles, this isn't one of them.And Ray, well he fell off the wagon long time ago.This is just another movie in the company of Mr. Chelios that makes me forget why I once liked him(the other being Revolver).\n\nI've never liked Claire Forlani, always seemed wooden to me.Seems miss Sobieski learned something from her.Why is that, I don't know, since Leelee showed some promise early on in her career.\n\nRhys-Davies and Perlman can be forgiven, they're not at their first mischief of the kind.\n\nI kind of liked Will Sanderson(again) and Brian White in their roles though.\n\nOn the other hand, I liked this movie enough to give it a 5.Well to be honest it's more of a 5.5, but IMDb's rating system isn't my cup of coffee.Why did I rate this \"insert insult here\" movie a 5?Because, unlike the others, it's a little better directed, it's a fun popcorn movie, and looks a lot better.Probably the best looking Boll film to date.Plus it manages to be fantasy, despite the poorly written script.And some of the excesses of Boll's previous films are missing.Which is good(even though the misplaced music is still there, the overly long emotional wannabe scenes also).Thus proving my theory that Boll is learning with every new movie he makes(hopefully, even though he'd need hundreds of movies to breach the decent barrier).\n\nI still don't understand why people are so keen on attacking the guy.Has he reached that kind of cult status?Because that is achieved by overly despised people as well as the overly appreciated.\n\nI wonder why people keep seeing his movies, or at least keep an eye on what he's doing, when they consider him so despicable.If only you wouldn't pay attention to the man, he'd probably think he has nothing else to prove and retire.Then again, why should we care if he continues to do his movies?No one forces us to watch them."

The first point of note is the choice in editing. Simultaneous action scenes spliced together are common in this genre. The quiet scenes occasionally also spliced in do not fit and would be better placed afterwords, or before, by themselves. The restraint of emotion in certain scenes is in poor decorum for the material covered, typically with our heroic members. Contrastingly, Liotta and Lillard are jarringly insane, to the level of Shakespearean madness, without the decent dialog to back it up.\n\nThe number of characters makes the development far too sharp (I already just used \"jarring\"). Honestly this would have probably been better as a mini-series.\n\nThe point that I must make though is this: this film is decent enough as entertainment to receive detailed criticism. It is only a few solid points off of being good. It is far short of the epic that a $60Mill budget would demand, but still acceptable.\n\nFilmamker is showing improvement."

But I figured with Jason Statham, Leelee Sobieski, Ray Liota, Ron Perlman, Clair Forlani and Jonn Rhys-Davies that there would have to be some redeeming qualities. There were not.\n\nThis sinkhole of a movie was like 5% Lord of the Rings and 95% Power Rangers. The fights were ridiculous and the bad guys were in rubber suits. I just do not know how this movie actually made it to the screen. You think at some point someone would have screened it and realized that this much suck in the same movie just needs to be put out of its misery. This is the first review I have written on IMDb and am only writing it in the hopes that you can avoid this movie."

And Jason Statham was in it so it couldn't that bad. I was not expecting much because its a Uwe Boll movie.\n\nBut then i watched it and i was like...huh its really a Uwe Boll movie? I liked it, I'm not saying its my favorite movie of all time, but i really enjoy it and didn't have the impression it was a Boll movie(they always look cheap with terrible acting and poor special effect) I was greatly surprise and the only big complain i could put on it was that it was not very violent, a lot of slashing with swords etc and still not much blood sadly. But the storyline was nice, character where good, i will say it, I DID ENJOY THIS MOVIE even tough its directed by Boll. Of course it won't excuse him for these horrible Bloodrayne movie but a least he will have do one nice movie."

Pictures of their loved ones tied to chairs and being forced to watch BloodRayne over and over again? Ron Perlman's and John Rys-Davies' talents are sadly wasted here. Never mind the fact that Ray Liotta is better than this! And certainly Burt Reynolds (whom you youngsters may not know was an Oscar nominee in his day) is better than this! And talented actors they all are, so this is definitely not their fault. With good material and good direction these actors can handle anything.\n\nWhich brings us back to the point I'm trying to make. The direction is not just wooden, it's lame - and I'm guessing Boll's \"vision\" for the film was phoned in - long distance - even during the final edit. Though I can't see how even a great editor could have saved this mess from becoming schlock. He just wouldn't have any competently directed scenes on film to work with!\n\nMaybe Uwe Boll's films make money in non-English speaking countries where no one can tell that the dialog is trite and the acting is stilted. No, not stilted, smothered - by the kind of mis-direction that wouldn't be acceptable in an undergraduate film class. But that's still no excuse. So please, somebody, anybody, get the dirt on Mr. Boll so we can find out how he does it -- and stop him before he does it again!"

But then I saw Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, and other recognizable actors. Given that it's the quality of a B movie, I was really surprised to see the class of actors they were able to get. I was intrigued by this and somehow sat through the rest of the movie. But unfortunately it never improved beyond bad.\n\nA bad director can make ANY actor look bad. This was a very amateurish film, and without the charm of a B movie.

The music was sometimes way over the top for what happened on screen and it also was a complete LOTR rip-off at times (When farmer is first introduced for example).\n\nDialogs are poorly acted and battles tend to be repetitive and the scenes are way too long.\n\nThe only reason why I don't mark it a 1 vote is that the visual effects are pretty nice at times but it doesn't make up for this garbage.\n\nA waste of my evening."

I had hoped that maybe Bloodrayne was a crap-luck situation, but no; the other reports are dead-on. This movie, though, was BY FAR better than the other. Here's my take:\n\nFirst, the acting. Let's just get it out of the way right now: there really wasn't any to speak of whatsoever from half the cast. The actors were just reading the lines. A couple of the others were over-the-top all the way through--Ray Liotta and Matthew Lillard (hope I spelled those correctly, sorry if I didn't). The only one who came close to not sucking was John Rhys-Davies; he was not bad (that's the best I can give him for this one). The rest--pathetic, and it's ALL Boll's fault.\n\nThe action, though, was pretty good. Lot of mixed genres in there--Western-style martial arts, Midieval, Kung Fu, fantasy. Thing is, it was all done well. The actors were physically on par, and the choreography was really well done.\n\nAlso, kudos to the special effects guys. The costumes, weapons, effects, etc., were all high caliber and creative. That crew gets points for doing their job right.\n\nLast but not least, the plot. Not completely sure what to say here. Not horrible, but not that memorable either. So I guess the plot is just fairly ho-hum.\n\nFinal judgment: if you want some mindless violence, watch it. Turn the sound off while they're talking or just fast-forward to the battle sequences. The rest, forget it. And feel pity for the actors that they had to suffer under Boll's lack of ability to direct."

This is not some low budget movie as you maybe would except it from Uwe Boll. Sometimes there are good actors involved but their acting is really poor in that particular movie but that's not the case here, either. Moreover you might think that this kind of story is too much of a predictable one but I don't think that applies here. There are well made and entertaining battles and great actors which makes this movie worthwhile watching if you're into this kind of stuff."

Editing isn't that good, CGI was OK and the acting was reasonably well done. The story was the familiar good against evil with a lot of battles going on. Dialogues were not memorable.

Strangely some well known and quite decent actors (notably John Rhys-Davies and Jason Statham) was lured into this project - and their performances are pretty much all the quality this film has to offer.\n\nScripting and directing is, at best - on par with an episode of Xena The Warrior Princess. The editing is even worse, with strangely cut pauses in dialog and music breaks that clearly does not fit in. Special effects are clear-as-day CGI, but that is to be expected from a low budget flick. Also on the technical side I couldn't help to notice that some scene were notably blurry, with poor colors and also strange blurry panning - almost as the direct view recording (or whatever it's called) was used instead of the main camera at some points.\n\nTo sum things up, if you decide to watch this despite all the warnings - make sure to have a couple of drinks handy.

Guy Ritchie kicked off his career with two fantastic films; Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch. After that, someone made the mistake of letting him decide his own fate, and he's pumped out a trash load of crappy action films that are meant to stroke his balding ego.\n\nThat said, I was bored on a weekday, and this film came on, so I went ahead and watched it. And, as most Uwe Boll films do, it did not disappoint to disappoint. It's flat out horrid. It's so bad, you think it could finally bury the devastatingly bad acting career of Statham. Unfortunately, that's not the case, as he's managed to churn out some of his worst films since; Death Race and Transporter 3.\n\nThe point is, if you're look for the Bizarro world version of a Kubrick/Scorsese-esquire directing career, Uwe Boll is your man. He has made multiple video game-based movies, for f'ing sake! Only a director bent on a career of the most disappointing movies man has ever seen could use as his visionary light a 1990's video game. Bravo, sir, I could drunkenly drool out a better premise.\n\nUwe Boll, if you're reading this, please do something else with your life. Like postal work. Or landscaping. At least the damage you would do to someone's grass would only ruin the lives of one household."

Not since Lindsey Lohan (I Know Who Killed My Career) have I seen such a hack job done on a fairly high budgeted film. No need of spilling the beans here with anything that could give away the plot...because there was no plot! If you like watching ice melt or get off on root canals, well, tuck in and enjoy. I can't believe this guy is directing another film, something is rotten in Germany and it ain't the cheese. I think Ed Wood may have new competition for worst director and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' may have a rival for worst film ever...only problem, this will never be considered camp or fun like the other."

A plot line equal to the task of loosely giving reason for a video game, it comes across even weaker as one for a movie. Another fantastic cast in a Uwe Boll film, which means the cast can only do so much to save another inevitable Boll failure.\n\nSo far as acting goes it struck my friends and I that Matthew Lillard's characterization was very well done, and could only have possibly been outdone by Andy Dick, which should tell you just how low a caliber character Lillard had to portray. Ray Liotta in most of his scenes looks like all he's missing is a white tiger and Sigfried in the background. Other notable actors did enough for their roles, nobody really stunk at them, but the weak direction left their impact rather flat.\n\nWe wasted a Netflix choice on this turkey, much less the better part of an hour and a half watching this movie. I highly recommend you don't follow suit."

Ray Liota was unrecognizable as was Ron Pearlman and Leelee Sobieski, while Jason Stantham was quite fine, because he apparently understood the movie as being an action movie, the rest of the characters think they're in some Shakesperean play.\n\nIt appears the movie has an identity chrisis, it is very very far from being fluent, there are scenes that leave you in utter disbelief, or you have no idea why something happened, or you just saw something that is obviously impossible and then there are plenty of nice, likable, almost perfect scenes. Without thinking hard, it's tough to say why this movie is so bad, it's almost as if the director was cursed, unable to produce one single movie worth watching, like he was Ed Wood.\n\nI couldn't recommend watching it..."

I didn't realize that until the end of the movie and seeing his name there, it all made sense.\n\nThis movie is really bad. If you watch it with a bunch of your friends while toking some homegrown wacky weed or having some beers... laughing at all the plot holes and stupid bits, then you might enjoy it (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1).\n\nI couldn't understand how Uwe Boll can continue to make movies and how he could recruit such an all-star cast for this movie. I think I understand now.\n\nMy first theory is that Uwe Boll is, in fact, proof of God. Because the only way I could imagine that he could still be making movies is if he had sold his soul to the Devil. However, I have since been educated that his films are backed by the German government. Corporate Welfare again rears its ugly head.\n\nAs to why such big names appear in his movies... I think I realize the answer to this too. The worst director of all time was Ed Wood. His movies are truly awful. They were so bad, that they gained a following of fans who would get drunk or stoned and pick apart how bad his movies were. Ed Wood gained further notoriety with the movie about him which featured Johnny Depp. I think Hollywood and Hollywood actors have come to the insane idea that Ed Wood was actually a misunderstood genius. That awful film will immortalize you just as much as a work of genius.\n\nAs I was watching \"In the Name of the King\", I paid attention to the acting of Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, etc. I think they were having fun in their roles, not taking them seriously at all. They knew the movie was a steaming pile of fecal matter and they were reveling in it.\n\nAnyway, I cannot recommend this movie. Not for rental, not to illegally download for free. If your kids think that Power Rangers are cool... then I would think this movie would be adequate for them. This is definitely elementary school level."

UWE FRAKING BOLL!!! I have never seen one of his films, but I did read the article in Wired a few years ago when he boxed some bloggers and the like. I couldn't believe it.

I've read some of the comments that this should not be compared to LOTR. May I ask why? Compared to LOTR this movie is jam packed with action and momentum, not the least a decent ending. Of course, not as well written and financed. The actors make a decent work in the genre, and really make the movie a better experience like say, Conan the Destroyer or Red Sonja. Not to mention that any movie where Jason Statham mutilates, beats up and utterly mangles his enemies is a huge plus. In conclusion i'd say it's a watchable entertainment package that stays loyal to the source material in good and bad, and it's not a bad sit through on a rainy day."

So we thought, game's great so maybe the film won't be bad... 2. We both love films with Jason Statham, always loaded with action. So why would this one be bad? 3. The price was great and we could get it for a tenner, which seemed to be great value. After watching the film, we said the same thing: 5th category cinematography. It didn't even resemble the original story of the game, apart from a couple of names. Krugs looked somewhat cheap... I can only say, if you don't have anything to do and can get it for free from a friend to watch, go on. You could always spend that time in a worse way (drinking, taking drugs etc.) If you are to pay for it, don't bother."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must be a glutton for punishment, but I decided to see this movie because with the trailer, it looked like it might have some potential. I have seen only two previous Uwe Bowe films and they were horrible.... I didn't have any high expectations, but I was just hoping this one would be different. Never again.\n\nIf I were to repeat what a previous reviewer mentioned ... how does he get such fantastic actors to do his movies? Don't these actors know that his movies are terrible? This definitely proves the fact that a good director is ESSENTIAL to a good movie. And that even great actors cannot shine when there is a horrible direction ...\n\nI see a lot of posts where people just say that a movie was awful and that Bowe is an horrible director, but don't explain why....\n\nI'm not a professional director or anything, but I just want to know if Bowe understands that shooting a scene requires perhaps ... a point, and like, maybe something to be accomplished. This can't be done when the each scene is about 30 seconds long. And just ENDS abruptly - like with a question that doesn't get answered. Slow things down a bit\u0085. And maybe EXPLAIN some things.\n\nEven with the completely ridiculous dialogue in this movie, character development is very important in a plot - and when an audience is just taken on a whirlwind of different shots that don't linger long enough to fulfill any depth, then we are left with a very confusing and flat storyline. Seriously, is this a movie \u0085 or a music video??? There are more cuts in this movie than an international hair show. Obviously Bowe is very sloppy, lazy and doesn't spend the time to make any storyboards\u0085 I'm sure if he did Greenpeace would be on his ass, cause that'd be a waste of a LOT of paper ....\n\nScenes are also cut in between each other quite frequently. At which it makes things utterly bewildering and a complete mess. Especially when you are inter-cutting a quiet dinner scene with a fight scene. Some really good directors can do it \u0096 but there has to be a connection between the scenes. Otherwise it is just idiotic. Remember the scene in ***Spoiler for LOTR: Return of the King*** when Pippin is singing to Denethor and they cut between his song and the battle. That is the sign of a good director. It was done with a reason and is incredibly powerful to the film. I know it ludicrous to compare the two, but just to make my point that there must be some purpose for inter-cutting scenes.\n\nIn addition, EVERYTHING is scored. Music adds a lot to film, but it is not necessary at every possible second in the movie. A good director is able to incorporate the score and with it, add emotion to a scene without the audience even noticing it. The score in this movie was so overdrawn that it was annoying... in fact it helped to incorporate an deadly element of cheesy melodrama....\n\nIt's quite obvious that Bowe is attempting to shadow the Lord of the Rings trilogy as he quite blatantly steals many components of the films. However, comparing him to Peter Jackson... well ...I can't even write both their names in the same sentence.\n\nThis movie had tremendous potential. But adding Bowe into it is like dropping some fish sauce into your Lemon Meringue Pie.\n\nDon't waste money on this movie. I couldn't even finish it. It's terrible. And these are reasons why I believe so."

Sure, we're not dealing with a prodigious talent here, but Boll must be doing something right to assemble such a recognisable cast. Who else would think to produce an Arthurian pantomime with Hellboy, The Transporter, the Bandit, Gimli the dwarf, Shaggy from Scooby Doo, Hallam Foe's mum, one of the GoodFellas and a Terminator? A triumph of enthusiasm over ability, it has all the traditional fantasy ingredients: reluctant yet vengeful hero, damsel in distress, evil sorceror, good sorceror, world-weary king, cowardly duke, orc-like hordes, and even throws in a boomerang and a few babes in the wood for good measure.\n\nUnfortunately, it's all dungeons without dragons and lords without rings. In the event, Boll overcooks and overcuts the whole caboodle to make it seem more exciting than it really is. But you have to admire him for playing it so straight.\n\nOne question: is Statham's character called Farmer because of what he does or because his brow looks like a ploughed field?"

You would think with great, fun actors like Jason Statham, Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman and Matthew Lillard it would be a great fun movie. I looked up some info and this crap actually won a few awards! it won a Leo Award for Best Costume Design in a Feature Length Drama and Best Production Design in a Feature Length Drama. Which is not bad but there had to have been something better nominated! And why oh why was it nominated for Best Picture Editing in a Feature Length Drama. This is the worst edited movie ever! It made no sense! Go figure the Leo Awards are Canadian. In Germany it one an award for sound. Maybe its just the DVD I am watching but the music is so loud I came barley hear the dialoge Actually that may be may be a blessing! There is too much action and not enough story. The scenes that advance the storyline are so few and far between and chopped up I forget what's going on. The only reason I give it 2 stars is for the performances of Rhys-Davies, Perlman, Lillard and Sobieski. I find now that I enjoy watching them in anything and I mean anything. I feel as is I am watching a side story while the actaul plot is going on some where else."

The effects were great and the colors were as well.\n\nMy only beef was that some of the acting was a little lacking, also the lack of a consistent accents is an issue. The other thing is casting Bert Reynolds as a main actor in anything is a mistake especially a epic movie. The main villain is also a annoying actor that could have been played by someone else."

I'm not really interested enough to turn my head to the left check though. I'm on hour two of this 3 hour snoozefest. It looks like everything was shot in the same forest clearing and they just keep walking over the same ground over and over and pretending to travel. Also due to some really choppy editing characters are in completely different locales instantly. It's like they just keep teleporting from shot to shot. And the main character's name is \"Farmer\", it just sounds stupid. Ray Liotta has spent the last 90 minutes crouching in some mystical digital hurricane flashing his goofy 1980's sideburns dressed as a wizard. I didn't know that there were wizards from New Jersey. There's this one point where a monster lights himself on fire, climbs into a catapult and is launched into a tree trunk, gets up and hugs someone until they both immolate. That's actually a pretty good analogy for how I assume this movie was made. Worst of all Jason Statham does next to no karate in the film. What a waste!"

Their final fight might not go down into the history of the best ones, but it's very original.\n\nF/x are mediocre at times, but overall well made. The krugs looked a bit much like cheap orcs, but there you go. I guess the director didn't have the budget Peter Jackson had for LOTR. Favourite bit was the fight in the woods. Dungeon Siege succeeds in action and characters, plus variety of the very good looking sets. Just don't expect shakespearan dialogues.\n\nI'm a major Jason Statham fan and while Chaos and Revolver pretty much sucked lately, this fantasy piece is him in best form again. It's all about the action and that's never a bad thing. Can't wait for Transporter 3 and Crank 3, but so long I was satisfied with Siege. Recommended for all the Statham geeks!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you want your classic fantasy movie, this is it. It's got a simple farmer, bad guys who ruin his life, good guys beat bad guys. It's nothing special. The plot is rather predictable and is not new at all, even the \"twists\" are predictable. There is really only two good actors in the entire movie, the cgi is half decent but in the wide-shots it's easy to tell. Props are basic but still well done. It's obvious that the director was attempting to imitate any number of movies, Lord of the Rings especially, but in the same respect, it's hard not to imitate one movie or another these days.\n\nI know I just said a bunch of... negative things about this movie, but I think it is still a half decent flick. If you watch it expecting a Lord of the Rings epic tale, you are going to be very disappointed - but then again there aren't many movies of that quality. Watch this movie and take it at face value. Don't try to look any deeper then what you see, because there really isn't anything more. Enjoy it for what it is. A nice little fantasy tale where the good prevails over evil.\n\nBtw if you were curious, I would say that you could watch this as a family or let your kids watch it, assuming they are not to young of course. There is nothing that is all to scary and the fighting sequences are gore free, you see maybe three people impaled on swords and a few lit on fire and a few others shot with arrows. There is nothing graphic, it's more of a \"ouch that would hurt\" kind of thing. Some of it even bordering on the ridiculous."

They are attacked by Krugs controlled by the magician Gallian (Ray Liotta). Zeph is killed and Solana is captured. With Norick (Ron Perlman) and Bastian, he sets off to rescue Solana. They meet Elora (Kristanna Loken) in the forest. King Konreid (Burt Reynolds) is undermined by his scheming nephew Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard) who is in league with Gallian. Merick (John Rhys-Davies) is the King's right hand man but his daughter Muriella (Leelee Sobieski) had also been seeing Gallian in secret.\n\nI probably gave this an extra point because I actually played the video game. Uwe Boll is a horrible director. This movie has enough money to work. The acting power is there on the screen. Statham is solid. However, this is an Uwe Boll movie. The story is boring. The dialog is horribly clunky. All the royal intrigue is unnecessary. It could have simply be Statham on a quest but that would be too good to be true. There's no way Boll would make anything good."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've heard so much negativity & just plain hatred for this swords & sorcery adventure & it's director Uwe Boll but i Never listen to what everyone says because i usually like the films that all the \"Critics\" usually hate, so i wanted to see this \"disaster\" for myself!!!\n\nIn The Name Of The King: A Dungeon Siege Tale is a fun & fairly Epic action-packed fantasy adventure & i enjoyed it!!!\n\nNow when i started watching this i thought how weird the casting choices were of Burt Reynolds & Ray Liotta & Mathew Lillard but as the film went on these bizarre choices actually all fell into place perfectly!!!\n\nHollywood Legend BURT REYNOLDS (R. I. P) actually suits being the old king & the manic MATHEW LILLARD was a great choice as the slimy, mental & cunning traitor as the Kings Nephew that is in cahoots with the evil magician played by a hammy RAY LIOTTA who is wanting to take over the kingdom & the land by gathering an army of monster warriors named \"The Krug\" (yes similar to Orcs) & those three strange casting choices actually worked out so well.\n\nNow our hero of this epic tale is action legend JASON STATHAM as a peaceful family-man named \"Farmer\" who is a farmer & lives a quiet life with his beautiful wife (Claire Forlani) & their young son & STATHAM plays the type of scowling & hard fighter character he always plays & that's absolutely fine because we expect that & he delivers his kick-ass action in spades & we get one of my all time favourite actors ever as his best buddy \"Norick\" played by the great RON PERLMAN, this guy is in his comfort zone here in these period pieces of fantasy & action & has done many of these pictures such as \"Season of the Witch\" & \"Outlander\" & \"Conan\" & \"In the Name of the Rose\" & \"The Scorpion King 3\" among others, Ron Perlman is great as the kind-hearted but strong warrior Friend & gives another classy & likeable performance & a good character who gets plenty of great fight scenes.\n\nAlso another really good performance comes from the underrated LEELEE SOBIESKI (Road Kill) who is a warrior with powers & the daughter of the kings wizard friend played by JOHN RHYS-DAVIES, another very good performance by a guy who is really into his role & a great character. The cast is actually great.\n\nGreat points: This film will obviously be compared to \"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy\" & yes there's similarities as both are about the same type of stuff but i would pick \"Dungeon Siege\" over any \"Lord of the rings\" film as i enjoyed this B-movie fun fantasy way more & it's not as long & overdone as those films & i like this cast better, i mean Statham & Perlman together, Great.\n\nThe production levels are also actually Awesome most of the time except for some poor c.g.i times but it's mostly nice set pieces & real locations where all the action takes place.\n\nThe battle sequences are fantastic & the fighting is exciting, fast & kickass especially from Statham.\n\nMathew Lillard is over-the-top manic but it's suited to his annoying & horrible character that you so want to die.\n\nRon Perlman steals every scene he's in.\n\nThe \"Krug\" have a fun B-movie vibe to them & how they look, proper late-night B-movie fodder monsters.\n\nThe look & cinematography is often beautiful especially the scenes with the Forest warriors that come down from the vines in the trees.\n\nSome Bad Bits: The music score tries to be too Epic & emotional & weighty & dramatic for a fun B-movie adventure flick.\n\nSome of the c.g.i is cheap looking & some scenes look very artificial.\n\nThe film takes itself abit too seriously.\n\nThe opening scenes with Statham & his family is way over sweet & comes off ridiculously cheesy & feels like some Hallmark advert or something.\n\nIt is probably abit too long for a simple fun B-movie adventure film but it wasn't boring i gotta admit, it was entertaining.\n\nI think I've given an honest review here & from not a Hater of the director or anything, i watched it for Statham & Perlman & it was a fun & action-packed fantasy adventure exactly like i expected it to be & i enjoyed it & would watch it again!!!\n\nPretty decent in my opinion."

I don't know what the budget is but i dare say it was spent on the cast and not the movie. I think you get my point so i will stop before i write something improper.\n\nNow for some bullet points:\n\nBad Points: ( Here i Go!)\n\n1) Director and direction. 2) Writer and Script adaptor for screen. 3) Costume - I mean, these bad soldier guys? Come on... 4) The CAST! I mean, did the not read the script and see what drivel they were getting themselves in for. 5) The Length of the movie. Schindlers list, Forrest Gump.

At least give Boll credit, this one is a step above his other crap like House of the Dead or the horrible Alone in the Dark, he's maturing as a director and this movie is that proof, it's not a big leap forward but hopefully the man can get it one day. I found the movie entertaining, it was a little more original than I thought, the whole time I watched this I didn't think once that I was watching a cheap rip off of LOTR I just felt like I was taken back to a simpler time when fantasy movies didn't need to be as artsy and Oscar worthy as LOTR."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this film when looking on IMDb to see the films that Jason Statham had been in. I am a fan as i like to be entertained. A lot of his films are over the top action, but i find that very entertaining. He will never win an Oscar, but most of his films are great fun. I wondered why I had not seen this advertise at the cinema, but within the first 10 minutes it was completely obvious that this film skipped the cinema and went straight to DVD and didn't waste any time going to 'free view with your package' on love film.\n\nWhere to start, this is clearly inspired by the Lord of The Rings films, which i loved. But the first problem with this film is the director Uwe Boll. I'm surprised this guy has been given the responsibility as director. This really is not his true talent. I feel sorry for anyone who was duped into being involved in the film thinking it would be an epic fantasy film that would end up a classic. The cast is good enough for an action film. Statham is Statham and it feels like you are watching The Transporter, but in the woods. He is convincing as a tough guy, but doesn't fit with this type of film. Burt Reynolds looked the part, but looked like he was filling a space in his schedule as he is so wooden and makes no effort. John Rhys-Davies is his usual over the top self. He almost provides some creditability, but almost becomes laughable.\n\nRather than compare this film to LOTR's i think it would be best to compare it to Xena Warrior Princess. It has that cheap family feel to it especially when they add in the pointless pieces of comic relief.\n\nThis film is a massive waste of time. I'm glad i watched it on my own on a weed night and didn't watch it with friends on a Saturday night as if it was my choice then no one would allow me to pick another film ever again. I would recommend that if you see this to rent/buy or watch online that you do not hesitate and just move to whatever is next.\n\nBad directing, bad script, bad acting, bad special effects, but reasonable fight scenes, but it was very noticeable that they only had about 100 extras just doubling up. When they have the army lined up they are quick to move to another angle before they run out of people to fill the shot. The creatures are really poorly designed and are not scary or creepy what so ever.\n\nIf you are a fan of Xena then you still may be disappointed in this 156 minute movie. Shocking film."

The movie is not exceptional in anything, but its not also exceptionally bad in any part. It's pretty straightforward, bad guys are bad, good guys are good, there's love in it, there's magic in it, there are wars with ugly ogres in it (or whatever they are), what else you want from a fairytale for kids ? I would recommend it when you wanna keep your youngsters occupied for two hours and they're under 13."

I agree there are many flaws that someone on a mission to criticize could sink their teeth into so if it is your intent to go to this movie for that purpose then I ask on behalf of the audience to keep your comments to yourself. It is apparent that the actors and crew on this film really did work hard and try to deliver a product of entertainment. The film was fine for TV but I would have expected more for one in the theater. The only character that was really bad was Duke Fallow who was extremely annoying but didn't ruin the whole film. I agree that it is not a great film but no where near as bad as many commenters have depicted it to be although I suspect it would have been that bad if not for the great cast. Overall I was entertained and if you're not a critic wannabe then go ahead and see it."

Making movies adapted from video games is a good idea but everyone knows that a game or film made by the counterpart always, and I repeat, always bad. They ruin the franchise. When the film started, I thought it was okay until it got to the first battle scene in Stonebridge, #1 I don't see a bridge and #2 there was only a house or 2 that was actually in stone. How awful. The bit where Statham's character slashes and 'kills' a krug, wheres the blood? How was he able to lift that ugly goblin thing? We know these characters have blood as we see Solana with some on her head, Gallain when stopping a sword smash onto his head, Duke stabs some general and wow, there's blood on the dagger but no, slashing in that universe means no blood for either the krug or the humans. Another question that popped up in my head, why where the krugs taking the humans, to be slaves? all i ever saw was them tied in chains sitting on the floor.\n\n'In The Name Of The King'. Okay what does that mean? 90% of the film was about Statham's character, we only learnt about him being the king right before his battle with Gallain.\n\nit's truly awful, I watched it because I thought it was interesting, hence the title name but nope, I will never again watch a movie by this awful director, WHY IS HE STILL DIRECTING?????????????????????????????????"

Leelee Sobieski was a complete surprise, though. She could and should have done better.\n\nSo what did you expect? The plot was predictable, the dialogues painful and the special effects directly proportional to the movie's budget. Lord of the Rings this could not have been.\n\nThis being said, the rest of the film was quite enjoyable. Good versus evil, ridiculously short cut dialogue or story scenes, just as ludicrous long fight scenes, everybody is the son, daughter or some distant relative of one's neighbour, love, revenge... fun fun fun.\n\nBottom line: ridiculous but possibly enjoyable film. It was bad, but not so bad as the IMDb rank would say. Ray Liotta did a decent villain, given the shallowness of the script, while Kristanna Loken finally returned to the short haired, short skirted leather wearing sexy self."

I'll admit the stupidity of it all actually made us laugh pretty hard a few times, but that's the only redeeming aspect you can find to this movie. After this one, I've officially concluded that Jason Statham just accepts any movie script you throw at him, cause he should have seen how bad this would be from the start. Uwe Boll is obviously well known for directing some of the worst movies around, which had I known that in the first case I would never have watched it. All the acting in the movie is HORRIBLE, which is surprising since some of the actors have actually been in tons of other movies and done a decent job. Ray Liota's character is dumb. Jason Statham's character name being 'Farmer', doesn't help anything since his acting is very sub par in this as well. Matthew Lillard become my least favorite actor for at least a year after his devastating performance in this movie as Duke Fallow. To go along with the bad acting, this movie couldn't have possibly took much to make since the bad guys known as the \"Grug\" I believe look like the initial Power Rangers villains from the early nineties. All in all this is an outrageously bad movie that I should not have the misfortune to see for sale on store shelves. Enjoy!"

Maybe he's learning?\n\nMy point is: for people seeking another \"so bad it's good\" classic, I recommend you look elsewhere.\n\nThe problem with Dungeon Siege is that the story and the acting are both fine(ish); it's the directing and editing that kill the movie. This makes it more irritating than funny, and aside from a few spots of ludicrous dialog (I dare you to make sense of Reynold's final speech!) it's more hum-drum than fun.\n\nOthers have enumerated the films worst points already (Liotta!), so I won't repeat them. However I have to say: the hate for Matthew Lillard confuses me. He single-handedly made all of his scenes watchable. If every actor had been as entertaining as he was, this would have been a much, much better movie.\n\nLong story short: not bad enough to be funny, not good enough to be good, so don't bother."

This movie is FAR better than some of the drudge that Sci Fi channel has put out over the recent years. This is also leaps ahead in quality to previous Bowle film's.\n\nYes, the acting was not gripping, and the action was a little \"eh\", but again, it was better than some low budget fantasy movies.\n\nLook at it this way, there was a solid beginning, a meaty middle, and an actual finish to this film. Bowle referenced towns and locales from the game from time to time, he maintained a basic drive and purpose for the enemies, and kept the heroes on track with their purpose. This movie did indeed hit on Fantasy Movie clich\u00e9's, but they managed to work well enough.\n\nNow, I know some will say a \"5\" is to gratuitous, but if this was NOT a Bowle film, would people actually have rated it higher? I am sure they would. Again, I am NOT a Bowle Fan. Alone in the Dark was not up to par, Blood Rayne was WAY to far from the plot of the game, and House of the Dead was dead in the water. In the Name of the King was enjoyable for the most part. Get over it. Just be glad he will never do Metal Gear Solid!"

The direction which was made by Uwe Boll wasn't something special or memorable and his attempt to deliver an epic tale ended up as a tedious, incoherent mess. The movie's weak script, poor interpretations, and laughable special effects didn't help at all. Despite its high-profile cast, which includes Ray Liotta who played as Gallian, Burt Reynolds who played as King Konreid, and Leelee Sobieski who played as Muriella, their interpretations were uninspired. Jason Statham didn't reach his potential and I believe he didn't fit for the role. Finally, I have to say that \"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\" is a very poor movie and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

When a farmer's family is adversely impacted by the evil beings he decides to take up with some some of the other locals and go toe-to-toe with the evil sorcerer and the king's son.\n\nThis movie is directed by Uwe Boll (BloodRayne) and stars Jason Statham (Crank), Ray Liotta (Goodfellas), Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Burt Reynolds (Gator), Leelee Sobieski (Joy Ride), John Rhys-Davies (Lord of the Rings), Matthew Lillard (Scream), Kristanna Loken (Terminator 3) and Brian White (Stomp the Yard).\n\nThe storyline and cast for this had tremendous potential. Unfortunately the execution was absolutely awful as were the special effects. The magic scenes by Liotta were painful to watch. I'm not sure Liotta was a good selection as the villain. The action scenes were uneven. Some fight scenes with Statham were good, some that needed CGI (like the rope scene) were as painful to0 watch as Liotta's magic. The creatures in the forest were awful and wasn't as menacing as the orcs in Lord of the Rings. The movie run time was also way too long. The film obviously tried to ride the Lord of the Rings coat tail...it fell way short.\n\nOverall this felt like a bad episode of Xena. This should not have been this bad with the storyline and cast, but once again Boll creates a debacle. I would score this a 2/10 and recommend skipping it."

All the leading roles are played by well known actors like Burt Reynolds, John Rhys-Davies, Claire Forlani and LeeLee Sobieski. Brian J White was drop dead gorgeous as commander Tarish.

Badly choreographed battles, slow and telegraphed moves while enemy just waiting there to get killed, no blood, to swords or spears piercing through. Only slashing just like a low budget B movie. And again with the yellow filter.\n\nComes Ray Liotta's character to finish me: dressed and groomed like a pimp from the dark ages.

In the other we've also got a good amount of laughably bad, shoddily made ones like \"Dungeons & Dragons\". Earning itself a likely permanent spot among the worst of is \"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\". It's a film that is not only poorly acted, written and made, but it's also tedious and excruciating to watch. The story follows a man creatively named Farmer (Jason Statham) whose son is killed by an army of orcs I mean Krugs. His wife is captured so off he goes to rescue her from the creatures and their foul overlord, the evil wizard Gallian (Ray Liotta?! Say it isn't so!). He gets some assistance from an old friend Norrick (Ron Perlman? Seriously?). We learn that Gallian is planning on raising an army to overthrow the king of the land (Burt Reynolds) with the help of the king's sniveling, slimy nephew, Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard). Time for some sword battles, epic battles in the rain, wizardry, some Ringwraith knock-offs and some silly political backstabbing. Take it away Uwe Boll! I'm not going to say that this movie rips off the Lord of the Rings, but there are some elements that are surprisingly similar. We've got the dueling wizards, with John Rhys-Davies (who played Gimli in the Peter Jackson films) playing the good counterpart to Gallian, we've got the armies of orcs, the elf-like forest creatures, the shadowy horse riders that Gallian uses to command his armies and a couple of scenes here and there. I'm not saying that this is a terrible movie because of these though, I'm saying the movie's so bad even if it was the first fantasy film you ever saw it you would have a hard time sitting through it.\n\nFirst of all, what kind of protagonist are we given? A guy named \"Farmer\". Apparently he calls himself that because he believes that a man is whatever he does. Does that mean that if he becomes the mayor of the town he'll change his name to \"Mayor Mayor\"? Jason Statham has had his share of bad movies but he's never been more wooden or less charismatic than here. Even when he's throwing boomerangs or inexplicably doing karate kicks, you'll wish the film was following someone else. Singling out Statham isn't quite fair though because pretty much everyone here comes off as an amateur. Matthew Lillard plays his character way over the top. It's a wonder the guy hasn't been thrown in a dungeon under suspicion of every single unsolved murder in the city. Ray Liotta looks absolutely bored in every scene he's in, but might just be trying to turn invisible so no one notices him. Overall, everyone is trying to get through the cringe-worthy dialog as best they can but few escape unharmed. I'd give some examples, but the film's lack of subtitles (an inexcusable sin considering this DVD was released in 2008) makes it hard to quote.\n\nI was actually taken aback by how shoddy the action sequences were. Every scene where farmer goes around kicking looks very staged and are not the least bit exciting. Late into the film they explain why our titular character is able to kick so much ass, but until then these Krugs come off as real chumps. A significant amount of them fall down after being kicked in the chest and then never get up and come on, they can't take down an old guy armed with a pickax? Story-wise, it comes off as pretty laughable often. I know it's for dramatic effect, but I'd like to imagine that the reason there happened to be a wedding going on when the Krugs first attack is that they're just jerks and wanted to ruin this perfect day by setting the town on fire and killing everyone in sight. Even the special effects aren't very good. Whenever Farmer throws his boomerang, it's an obvious computer generated effect and several of the environments looks downright cheap. I'm not talking about the sets, which are decent enough. I'm talking about the wide shots with castles and such.\n\nTo the film's credit the Krugs and done with practical costumes and while their armor and weapons look cheap, at least they don't clash with the hapless villagers they're slaughtering. The elves (or whatever they are called, to my knowledge they were never named in the movie) are played by talented acrobats that do their own stunts. Hurray for faint praise! The fact that I had to re-watch part of the film to jog my memory brings me to the film's biggest flaw: it's too long and it's boring. This beast runs at slightly over two hours and there's just nothing here that will capture your interest. The characters barely have any personalities, the legions of opponents aren't menacing and their masters are one-dimensional. The battles are edited frenetically, meaning you're going to have a hard time figuring out who is winning and which character is dying when things get rough. It's really difficult to explain why the film is boring, but I can easily see people turning this one off before finishing it. It's Uwe Boll's shoddy direction that sinks what could have been at the very least a film that's so-bad-it's-good into an absolute bore to sit through.\n\nNot even a reasonably big budget could save the curse of Uwe Boll. \"In the Name of the King\" proves itself to be a film that is utterly devoid of any fun moments, aside from a few action scenes where you can laugh at them ironically. It's absolutely terrible and I beg of you to stay away from it. (Theatrical version on DVD, January 24, 2014)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This was my first Uwe Boll movie. He's got a solid reputation as the world's worst director. And, indeed, the movie kicks of with this memorable dialogue between two lovers laying in bed:\n\nShe: I knew you'd come.\n\nHe: I told you I would.\n\nNext, about the greatest cast of all times storms the silver screen. It's so great that Robert de Niro couldn't even get the role of 3.rd dungeon toilet cleaner's junior assistant despite sleeping with the director's mother. Those that made it include Burt Reynolds, Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Ron Perlman ... those are my favourite four actors right there! What are they doing in this, to quote Bill Hicks, POS film? One marvels at the incredible cast, the cinematography, the scenery, the SFX, the action choreography and the stunts ... and trips over the nonexistent dialogue, the self-explanatory plot and the hammy one-take acting. And the blatant visual ripoffs from Lord Of The Rings and The Matrix. I don't think the actors had any lines, I think they were improvising. It must have been like: \"Jason! You have just caught Norick rogering your wife, and a bunch of wolf-beings attack, and Leelee Sobieski's got a dizzy spell. And, action!\"\n\nUwe Boll is basically a producer who also directs. I'm sure he's a unique kind of guy, somebody who feverishly loves movies, like Quentin Tarantino's evil twin. If he learns to handle dialogues better I'm sure that he'll make a great movie eventually. For now, Name Of The Kign is probably the greatest \"schlocker\" ever filmed."

Some of the lines are cringe worthy. The costumes are hit and miss - some of the krug are good, but some, are terrible. The camera angles and special effects look rushed in some scenes (not sure what was happening there). I'm not completely sure how they convinced so many actors to star in this, or how they got the money to make it.

Admittedly it falls short of the lord of the rings (saying that, keep in mind, very few fantasy films could compete with LOTR, and this film didn't have the same budget and perhaps more importantly didn't have J.R.Tolken as a writer) but it certainly does its best, and at times even comes close! Personally i would happily rate this up there with classics like willow and dragonheart, and it is by far superior to the dungeons and dragons films which have been offered up. Frankly its sad this film hasn't achieved the cult status it deserves. well worth the watch if you're looking for an action fantasy film!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Sixty million dollars!? You give a sizeable budget like that to Uwe Boll? A director infamous worldwide for producing some of the worst films ever made? Unsurprisingly, this film is awful. Although, considering it is my first Boll experience, I was expecting much worse. A nearby village is attacked by Krugs where a farmer mounts a rescue mission to save the captured villagers and gain vengeance for the death of his son. Swords, magic, large scale battles, sorcerers, woodland women, ninjas, a CGI boomerang and a myriad of famous actors destroying their careers. Yes, you guessed it. It is a discounted version of 'Lord of the Rings' except it's an adaptation of a video game that hardly anyone played. Aside from Statham's standard stuntwork and Lillard's enjoyably campy performance, there is nothing to enjoy here. Everything about this production looks cheap. Authenticity ventured across the land, into another kingdom called \"Middle Earth\". All that remains is laziness. The houses look like plastic. The Krugs clearly resemble extras wearing 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle' costumes. Perlman is using hair gel in a middle aged kingdom. The protagonist is a farmer called Farmer. \"He's taken two legions out of twelve!\", \"how many are left?\", \"...two thirds!\". Boll loves filming a one-dimensional make out session. Liotta and Reynolds are unfathomably terrible, as two kings fighting for...something...I guess power? Look, the story was so basic that I simply switched my brain off and admired the passion that Boll attempted to inject. I mean, he tried bless him. But this isn't an eating competition where you get a pat on the back for giving it a good go. This. Is. Film critiquing! You don't get points for trying. He failed, miserably. After the final showdown, which has more swirling books than a library in a storm, the film ends. Done. Finished. No more. Two hours blurred into one gigantic mess. This is easily one of the worst video game adaptations and fantasy epics ever conceived by an individual who believes he makes good films."

        "review_detailed_main": "My first experience with the \"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\" was in my youth. It was on TV and my father was watching, so I watched parts of it with him. It was weird, but I remember that I was impressed with action scenes, especially with the scene where a black man, a commander of some kind, fought while down in the mud, refusing to give up. Yesterday I decided to watch the full movie and not just the theatrical version, but the director's cut, with my friend. I was perfectly aware what kind of movie this is, but I love to watch bad movies, so I didn't hesitate one bit.\n\nThat this movie is really bad is something anyone can tell you. People mostly easily spot if something is good or bad. To explain why it is bad, is something that requires a bit more effort. To accomplish this, I'm going to split this review into multiple parts talking about different things. So, let's start.\n\nPLOT: First, let's address the fact that this should be a video game adaptation. My experience with \"Dungeon Siege\" is fairly limited, but it's safe to say that the connections are minimal, except for the Farmer and name of the land and Krugs. With that out of the way, let's talk about plot. An evil wizard Gallian drains the power of young female wizard to become more stronger so he can rebel against the king with the help of the king's disloyal nephew. Our main character, simply called Farmer, is living a peaceful life right until the moment where he isn't. His son gets killed and his wife is kidnapped. Luckily, Farmer is an unkillable killing machine with plot armour thicker than dragon's hide and it's up to him to save the day. Without any more spoilers, that's basically it. It's basic, but it could serve it's purpose. Right? Well... Let's talk about acting a bit.\n\nACTING: Most of the actors are actually doing their best, but actors can only do so much when there's nobody competent to give them directions. Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, John Rhys-Davies, Brian White and Matthew Lillard really tried to do their job well and earn their pay or at least have fun, but Perlman, Reynolds and the rest are mostly awful. But again, talent doesn't matter when nobody knows how to use it and that brings us to the script.\n\nSCRIPT: A lot of the script was rewritten late in the production because the whole thing was too similar to LOTR. That's should tell you all you need to know right of the bat. There's a lot of stupid stuff being spoken in this movie and some of it will leave you scratching your head with amazement that somebody actually wrote this and thought it looks good. Just wait until you hear the explanation to Farmer's origin, your mind will simply explode trying to understand what the author(s) of this script wanted to say. Moving on...\n\nVISUALS: There is some beautiful nature shown in this movie and some cool visual effects, but they are rare. Costumes mostly look bad (though some of them reportedly cost 10 000 $ to make), helmets are visibly made out of plastic and the whole thing feels cheap while being anything but.\n\nACTION: Probably the saving grace of the movie, though not by much. Siu-Tung Ching worked as an action choreographer on this movie (his salary was higher than Boll's) and he really tried to make action in this movie look cool and to his credit, it is kind of cool, but here's the problem. When you take a man who specializes in making martial arts action movies and task him with making a fantasy action movie, you get this. Farmer is basically a martial artist, he runs on shoulders of his enemies, jumps around like crazy and kills anyone he fights with no trouble. There are ninjas in this movie just because Ching had talented people in his team. Yeah, he really didn't understand the concept. There are very dumb things in this movie. A battle takes place in the middle of the forest and archers shoot volleys of arrows even thought they would get stuck in the trees, Krugs (basically copy-pasted Uruk Hai's) sit into a catapult and get catapulted onto their enemy, they are thrown at their enemy with the help of giant slingshots and the final battle takes place at a hill and then the soldiers decide to go down, fighting their enemies on the slope instead on top of the hill. It's painfully stupid, but if you awake the kid inside yourself, you can enjoy it a bit. Also, the final battle tries really hard to copy the atmosphere and style of The Battle of Helm's Deep, even copying shots from the scene.\n\nEDITING AND CINEMATOGRAPHY: The worst part of the movie by far. Kids in elementary school can edit videos better than this. A simple act of a man jumping is shown in 4 cuts! There is a lot of unnecessary cuts. A lot of them! And scenery is often in the way of action. Continuity doesn't exist. There is literally a scene where an army is marching and somebody decided to film the army walking on a path in front of which grew a large tree, so you can't see the whole army! It's almost as if this was edited by someone who doesn't know how a movie look like. This can somewhat be explained by the fact that first public cut of the movie was completed eight hours before screening, but still, it's unbelievably bad and drains even what little entertainment value remained in this mess.\n\nMUSIC: Outro songs are great, rest is forgettable though passable and at moments even nice, clearly inspired by LOTR movies.\n\nCONCLUSION: Look, it's so easy to blame everything on Uwe Boll, but I think this time it was not just him. It was everyone. What's done is done. In the end, \"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\" is a bad movie. It's watchable, has some entertainment value (though very little) and it's so bad that it warrants a single watch for you to see how a good fantasy movie shouldn't look. 4.5/10!"

Creating the world of Dungeon siege. The moment the story takes place in the forest, no real attempts of recreating the world as it should be. Uwe Boll produced four feature-length movies in 2007. Instead of creating something solid, he rushed through this project on all levels of movie making. Stay far away from this movie there is so much more to see. For Uwe Boll, I'll advise him to take some movie classes. For the time being, I learned to stay away from any of his projects. Camera and Art department and sound design are kinda good. Story writing, editing, directing, Colour grading, soundtrack are all poorly executed. to me, Uwe Boll proved one thing he managed to have a great cast and made them look bad, one of the biggest sins you can do as a director. Jason Statham proves again his fighting skills are awesome, but he doesn't need this movie to prove it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Where do we begin? I saw this film on DVD with a few friends after some terrible Chinese pizza and a lot of good Chinese beer. We have seldom laughed harder or longer for most good comedies we have seen together. Why?\n\nThe script and casting is to die for. I mean every actor uttering every word in this film dies on screen; in an a mass suicide of actors uttering ridiculous dialog. Talk about being all over the place:\n\nThere is a Viking funeral, Ninja warriors, Merlinesque English magicians, a touch of Saturday Night Fever and Goodfellas with Ray Liotta,(absolutely hilarious casting here),a Lord of the Rings quest, a borrowed plot line from The 13th Warrior (men dressed up as Orcs),another hilarious idea to cast Burt Reynolds as an ancient king,(I was waiting to see Sally Field as the Queen and it would have been perfect), forest choreography similar to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and a bad imitation of Dennis Hopper by some second-rate actor.\n\nOther than that, the film was completely believable.\n\nThe action sequences and production values were quite good; and fine for a video game. But this was supposed to be a movie with actors, direction, a plot, a script and a logical sequence. None of these are apparent in this turkey. But my friends and I had a grand old time lampooning just about every actor in every scene of this debacle. Just make sure you drink plenty of beer before you watch it.\n\nArthur H Tafero AskMrMovies.com Senior Reviewer"

        "review_detailed_main": "When I saw that this movie first, was inspired by a computer \"role-playing\" game, and, second, included Burt Reynolds as a supporting actor, I went in with low expectations. Those expectations were unfounded, and those two factors were both deceptive: the plot and characters were surprisingly well-crafted, and Reynolds put in what may be the performance of his career. (That may not be saying much, I'll admit, but it's something.) The acting all around is quite good, particularly at spots (most of them Ray Liotta's) where the action lent itself to over-the-top bravura but the performers opted for a more subtle approach. Some of the plot twists you can see a mile away, and others come out of nowhere, so while you know things are going to work out in the end the viewer can't be quite sure how it's going to get there. The only part I didn't care for, and that not by much, was seeing, without comment or explanation, two black men in charge of the army in what is clearly a society based on medieval Europe -- Brian J. White and Ron Selmour are both fantastic and deserving actors, but as out of place logistically speaking as the equally distracting lin-kuei (Chinese ninjas) who also serve in the King's army. Despite dead-on performances from both Reynolds and Leelee Sobieski, the film isn't going to win any Oscars, except maybe for the completely natural-looking visual effects or the dead-on costuming (lin-kuei notwithstanding), but it's definitely worth going to see."

Ray Liotta gives the performance of his career which by itself is worth the rental money but there's more to the film than just that, as long as you don't take thing too seriuosly and you like action films with a limited story then this film is great, I wouldn't change a thing about it, apart from maybe on the DVD release they could've condensed all the Ray Liotta bits into one segment and have it as an option to just watch that, \"you've won nothing but time\"."

I know Uwe Boll has made crap like House Of The Dead and Alone In The Dark but this film is a flawless for 2 and a half hours. Another thing the cast is spectacular especially Jason Staham and Kristanna Loken who really should be in more films she is a wonderful actress. This film is probably the best film of the 21st century knocking of the previous best We Are Marshall. If you want to see a epic masterpiece see In The Name Of The King."

So i watched it and i have to say Jason Statham you rock. OK that being said there are a few problems with this film Burt Reynolds although Im a fan he wasn't meant to play a king and then there is good ol ray some thought he was miss cast as well i think he did a fine job the costume designers on the other hand did not the story is typical and the action scenes in a couple brief moments it reminded me of when i was a kid watching power rangers yes i watched power rangers. So now your thinking well thats a lot of problems right well not for me it wasn't i was completely entertained i truly enjoyed this film i think Jason statham is phenomenal I cant help but root for him as a hero. But let me tell you this is one you definitely have to turn the brain off for just enjoy it .but this is a fare warning I am seriously easy to please when it comes too films I wish other could be too i think it would suck to have your enjoyment confined to a certain stable or type of film i count myself lucky I apologize for my spelling and punctuation etc and oh i didn't even quote poetry or use crazy large words and if i did I'm sure that i spelled incorrectly and or miss used them"

And now, after I have seen it, I'm more than glad that I have done so. As for the character selection, I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. Jason Statham is the best choice, the producers could have done. He plays his role, like he is born to Farmer! Also to have chosen Burt Reynolds as the king was a very good choice. He plays his role lovable. The only distracting thing was Ray Liotta, who plays his role very awful and the costumes of the kurg, which had something missing over it.\n\nI, as a very big Dungeon Siege fan, must say that the movie totally lived up to my hopes. Many elements are similar to the original Dungeon Siege world, but sadly there are also some mad differences. But if you know that in forehand (and you should, because it's a typical Hollywood movie), you will enjoy an entertaining time. I can't agree with other reviewers that the movie takes all too long to watch. For me the movie was over like in an instant, so exiting was it! This movie is definitely on my \"one day, I will watch this movie again, because it's so great\"-list.\n\nNow I'm very much hoping Uwe Boll will produce Dungeon Siege 2 and places the storyline exactly on the Dungeon Siege 2 computer game - that would be my movie wish of the year!"

But this one blew me away. Great performance from all actors with great plot and great lines. Some even funny scenes, of which I hoped there would be more. After all it is a sincere movie with deep plots- classic plots like good versus evil, man- wife, father-son relationship, father-daughter relationship, David versus Goliath etc. With so many great actors it must have been awful to cut each one down to 2 hours of play time. What really shines is the camera, not a strength of Uwe in the past. A lot of Close Ups that put maximum attention on the stars ability to act. This was reminiscent to how films were made in the first half of the last century- more Ben Hur than LOTR to sum it up. Also a plus Battlefield scenes that look much more realistic than most battle scenes in LOTR. Full Force Jason Statham fights like never seen before. CGI was always great and some scenes were totally new. Uwe answered some questions even referring to a second installment if this movie does well with the box office results. Really liked his down to earth approach, he is a real film maniac who cares a lot about his audience. Wonder if Tarantino shows so much affection towards his clients..."

Alright, Mr Boll have earlier made some lousy movies, but this has nothing to do with this movie. Give the man some credit, this time he has actually made a good movie. It is an epic action driven movie, the scenes are beautiful and even stunning at times, the script is well written, the camera work is quality work and the visuals are more than adequate. I even find the casting quite good, and to be honest I loved to see good old Burt Reynolds as King. In my opinion Ray Liotta is also perfect as the evil mage. A highly entertaining epic flick with a bunch competent actors and well directed, a movie I will enjoy watching again and again. If this is the new standard for future Uwe Boll movies, I look forward to his next movie. Thumbs up:)"

The interaction, the banter inbetween the characters. The acting is very good. The story is simple, a one thing lead to another structure, built set by set, and such progresses throughout. It's a lot like a theatre play, but without it's limitations.\n\nThe fighting scenes are also pretty good, there is plenty of action.

While not campy like 'House of the Dead' Uwe Boll (director) has proved himself to be someone to watch for. This is a must buy for me, and I would check out anything with Boll's name on it now.\n\nToo many people expected just another Statham action movie and others didn't go because they couldn't believe Statham in fantasy but where the former is simply a misplaced audience (and cranky about it), the latter has really missed out on an incredible fantasy movie."

The cast is extremely interesting: Burt Reynolds as the king and Rhys-Davies as the wizard have enormous screen presence in rather unusual roles, Forlani, Liotta and Statham would look good even if they only walked down the street, and Loken and Perlman are memorable supporters. Hiring Tony Ching to direct fast, elegant fight scenes was the icing on the cake. \"Dungeon Siege\" has a hero who isn't interested in saving the kingdom, he just minds his own business which only by accident becomes the same as saving the kingdom. That attitude keeps him with both feet on the ground with all the black magic around. This movie realized swords and sorcery are the most important ingredients for a sword and sorcery movie - I needn't point that out if it wasn't for too many films of the genre which failed here and thought it was about a princess falling in love or elves in nice spotless dresses discussing the burden of immortality."

        "review_detailed_main": "TEDDY FLIX REVIEWS -\"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2006)\" -- This film was EPIC! RIVETING! DAZZLING TO THE SENSES! Director Uwe Boll threw in everything from numerous bloodless be- headings, Jason Statham's character, \"Farmer\", running across the shoulders of a dozen orc-like adversaries called Krugs, whom also voluntarily set themselves ablaze to be catapulted against The King, Burt Reynold's soldiers. The movie starts off just fine with brief scenes of the leading players in their respective scenarios: Liotta romancing Leelee with some sort of magical special effects going on; John Rhys-Davies (as a Magi and adviser to the King) sagely crying out \"No!\" as if it meant something; Statham, as a family man farming a field with his son when Perlman shows up as a friendly neighbor; Reynolds as the King and Matthew Lillard (doing his best to bring the 20th Century to the \"middle ages time out of place\" that is the setting for the film) as his cowardly / jealous of the throne Nephew. TWO THUMBS UP GO TO THE INTENSE BATTLE SCENES!! My favorite sequences consists of Krugs and fiery catapults, horses rearing up to crush opponents while being ridden by Wraiths controlled by Liotta's magic, gliding magical forest women riding vines like it's Xena meets Tarzan, only hotter chicks, and also the final duel between Statham and Liotta just ABSOLUTELY ROCKS!

First off, the cast was much higher caliber than LOTR's; John Rhys-Davies, Ray Liotta, Painkiller Jane, Burt Reynolds, Ron Perlman, Jason Statham, and the chick from Mallrats. I personally will take King Farmer over King Aragorn any day of the week, and John Rhys-Davies makes a better Gandalf than Magneto ever did. Only the most un-American terrorist-lover would set a movie in New Zealand when we have the beautiful Pacific Northwest right in our backyard. One highlight was Jason Statham's beautiful escape from being hung by twirling around while hanging from the noose and killing the guy and cutting the rope with one swing of the bad guy's sword (though the ladies in the audience will undoubtedly argue he never really escaped from being hung). This movie also puts books firmly back in their rightful place as the weapons of villains, which was a move that was long coming. I can only wait and hope that the next two movies are picked up to top off the trilogy."
