        "review_detailed_main": "...or how to make a comedy without a laugh?\n\nWhen I first heard that there's a sequel to Dumb and Dumber I was ecstatic since this was the best comedy in ninenties and certainly one of the best comedies ever. But after seeing opening credits (No Jim & Jeff), I was a little sceptical. Never mind, it still can be good...\n\nErghh, wrong. The movie was getting worse and worse. The leading characters were shown like a couple of retards (very unlikable, since in original there aren't THAT slow), who were just trying to imitate Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels and failed miserably. Lack of charm, i guess. But the main fault goes to script writer who provides a lot of already seen jokes as the rest of the producers of this crap.\n\nI agree, it would be nearly impossible to beat the original version, since it was full of original black humor, but hey, at least they could try harder. Despite that movie sucked, it has some moments...but since i can't remember any if them, i couldn't rate it higher than\n\n3 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard to believe that it's actually been almost a decade since the first Dumb and Dumber, which was deservedly a smash hit, was released on the unsuspecting populace. I can see it now. I was in tenth grade, and I still remember ditching class in beautiful Irvine, California to ride my bicycle over to Fashion Island in Newport Beach so my friend and I could steal bubble gum from one of the ritzy drugstores and then go see this movie, which we must have seen in the theaters half a dozen times or so. Where we got the money I've been trying to remember for years.\n\nI'd like to start out by saying that I don't know that the prequel to the brilliant Dumb and Dumber (easily one of the most hilarious comedies to come along in decades) really deserves all of the vicious reviews that it has received from professional and amateur critics alike. It has been a popular and critical disaster from the day it was released, and while it's true that it is simply a bad, bad movie, I think that anyone claiming it to be 'absolutely THE worst movie I've EVER seen' might be exaggerating just a little bit. Or maybe I've just seen worse movies than these people. I've seen some seriously bad movies, and while Dumb and Dumberer is certainly an embarrassing flop, I've seen worse. It's better than Scary Movie 2 and 3 combined, for example.\n\nThat being said, on to the crapfests. Dumb and Dumberer, since I have neither the energy nor interest to research the intentions, strikes me almost unmistakably as one of those movies that one studio makes of another studio's movie. Kind of like how Pixar just publicly insulted Disney at the same time as they ended the two companies' partnership, and Pixar promptly announced that they would be making Toy Story 3. I expect Toy Story 3 may be a disaster (if the 'threat' was serious), possibly even purposely, in order to get back at Disney. I don't know that this prequel to Dumb and Dumber was done for revenge at all, but I can't say that it's all that mysterious as to why the original cast and crew had little to nothing to do with it.\n\nThat being said, I have to say that I'm impressed with the actors they found to play the younger Harry and Lloyd, especially Lloyd, because this guy, without the bowl-cut and the chipped tooth, looks NOTHING like Jim Carrey's Lloyd, but in the movie he's the spitting image. This is one of the reasons that I think the movie deserves at least minor respect. At least the casting director was on the ball. Sadly, it's all downhill from there. I have to admit that I was pretty happy to see Bob Saget acting again. Granted, I barely remember him in Full House at all and I saw his one spoken line in Half Baked as the official end of his acting career, but I loved his cheesy jokes on America's Funniest Home Videos (the ORIGINAL show) so much that seeing him on screen again was almost like a trip back to my childhood.\n\nAnd then Harry had a little incident involving chocolate, and I started to squirm in my seat, as I'm sure many other people started to do, given the reviews I've read. It is expected that some memorable scene from the original film would be almost duplicated in a sequel like this, but Harry getting diarrhea in the original movie was funny because it was there for a reason. Lloyd put massive amounts of laxative in Harry's tea to get revenge on him for dating the girl that he was after. Crude, yes, but still funny. In this movie, Harry goes nuts with the chocolate in the bathroom and then Jessica's poor dad (Bob Saget) comes in and screams a numbing stream of profanity about there being feces all over his bathroom. Not only is this supposed to be funny, but there is so much stock put into this idea that it's duplicated again later in the film.\n\nIt's sad that a comedy as smashing and brilliant as Dumb and Dumber has been followed up by such a stupid, stupid film. While I admit that you can hardly expect for them to have created something as great as Dumb and Dumber again, I really didn't think that they could have come up with something THIS bad. I mean, just the name itself should have inspired some better ideas for the movie. Sadly, it seems that the powers that be were more interested in throwing a sequel out there than they were in actually making it deserve its title.\n\nAnd when a movie isn't good enough to deserve a title like Dumb & Dumberer, it's a bad, bad sign."

The movie talks upon the adventures and misfortunes of two no brain teenagers from the beginning their acquaintance , when Harry (Derek Richardson) and Lloyd (Eric Christian Olsen) meet themselves at high school . The picture narrates the various pranks , the mischiefs with schoolmates and teachers (Eugene Levy) . The respective parents (Mimi Rogers and Luis Guzman) try to resolve the problems without success . They are idiot pals who are continuously doing jokes and seeing lustfully by the opposite sex .\n\nThe film mingles irony , chuckles , giggles , comedy and numerous sex jokes . And of course , there's very bad taste , being the extreme when happen the incredible scenes on the crap in the bathroom . The comedy is cheesy and gross-out but has some moments here and there . The film is an embarrassing and absurd mess , the plot is ridiculous and monotonous and is formed by several humor set pieces , being quite disagreeable and graceless . There are some steamy hot scenes and some memorable and hilarious happenings of dirty humor which will rejoice the rogue aficionados to these kinds of things . Neither the players , nor the filmmaking seem to be nice , and the storyline is utterly embarrassing , but , curiously , it has some amusing moments and I found myself laughing in some times of the movie . Eric Christian Olsen was repeatedly denied the role of Lloyd because the producers thought he was \"too good-looking\" . It was only after seeing some home-video footage of Eric in full make-up improvising a scene with already-cast Derek Richardson that they gave him the role . The cast secondary is pretty good , such as : Luis Guzm\u00e1n , Rachel Nichols , Eugene Levy , William Lee Scott , Shia Labeouf , Bob Saget , Julia Duffy and Mimi Rogers . Lin Shaye was the only cast member to star in both the original Dumb and Dumber and the sequel . The motion picture takes part of the large group about filthy and dirty humor , such as : \u00a8Scary movie\u00a8 , \u00a8American pie\u00a8and sequels . The previous film (Dumb and dumber) is much better ; plus , there were Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey who are greatest actors , here the protagonists are unknown . Rating : It's a awful turkey . Disconcerting as well as inferior sequel and bottom of barrel . Yawner and snooze is continued."

If there was ever going to be another film about these two characters it should have been a sequel starring the original pairing, instead we get this stinker. Dumb and Dumber hardly had an Oscar winning story line but gave us some great characters and a hatful of ball bouncingly funny gags, in the 'prequel' the weak story collapses under the weight of even weaker jokes! So uninspired is this movie that there are even rehashes of jokes from the original, just done slightly differently but in a totally inept manner. Dumb and Dumber is a classic, this is a pile of steaming doggy doo doo's. Do yourself a favour stick with the Carrey film and avoid this limp fish at all costs."

I just don't understand how they could make this movie and throw feces all over the memory of the first one.

        "review_detailed_main": "I really liked the original Dumb and Dumber. I thought it was a hilarious comedy that was better than it looked because of the writing/directing of the Farrelly Brothers and the acting of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. When I originally heard that they were doing a sequel to Dumb and Dumber, I was somewhat enthusiastic. Then, it was announced that they were doing a prequel. Enthusiasm meter dropped some. Then, the Farrelly Brothers announced that they wouldn't be involved. Enthusiasm went down some more. And finally, it was said that Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels weren't returning and were to be replaced by younger people. Enthusiasm went straight to hell. But I still decided to give it a chance because Eugene Levy was in it and he always finds a way to make the movies he's in funny. I was wrong again.\n\nThe plot - Harry and Llyod meet in the '80's and foil the corrupt principal's plans to steal money for himself and his mistress, the trashy lunch lady. Easily the stupidest plot I have ever heard. And I haven't even started dissecting this trash yet.\n\nBesides being a waste of celluloid, I have never seen such a cast whose talents were so horribly wasted. And there were so many good actors in this. There was Eugene Levy, Cheri Oteri, Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Mimi Rogers, Shia LaBeouf, and the obligatory cameo by Lin Shaye that happens with nearly every film from New Line (in fact, I wonder if she has some hidden cameo in the Lord of the Rings trilogy). The two actors who replaced Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels - Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson - are good replicates, but they just weren't Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. The cameo with Bob Saget was dead before it even began. And then, this \"film\" is so filled with so many mistakes (not including the film itself), I still wonder if this was done accidentally or by the filmmakers to see how many people would notice every mistake the film was filled with.\n\nI thought Gigli was a much better film than this (and that's saying something). This film is nothing but a waste of time, celluloid, talent, and air. I would rather have a root canal without anesthesia than sit through this hunk of garbage, which I rated as the #1 worst movie of 2003, ever again."

Thusly I figured it wouldn't take much to meet my relatively low expectations for it. After all, the first one was pretty funny, right?\n\nBefore I continue, it should be noted that this movie had none of the original cast members, writers, directors, etc from the first film.\n\nNo one, at least, worth noting.\n\nNow, back to the story. Where the first movie had laughs galore (most of them cheap lowbrow humor, but hey, if I want Shakespeare, I'll read Shakespeare...) this movie had a sprinkling of \"That's kinda funny...\" and \"Was that funny? I can't tell anymore...\" moments.\n\nThe most telling thing I can say about this movie is that I DIDN'T FINISH IT. Nay, I COULDN'T finish it.\n\nA friend of mine that had the misfortune of being in the room with me at the time said it best when he said: \"At one point I laughed at how painfully unfunny it was and I realized that it (the movie) had pulled me down to it's level.\"\n\nOf course he also said: \"Another reason dumb and dumbrererererrer sucked is that both guys were trying to cop Betty White's \"Rose\" character from the Golden Girls but neither of them possesses her panache or supple buttocks.\"\n\nVerily, it is a thing of evil.\n\nHaving said that, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen. I would have to give some thought to exactly which movie holds that dishonor. \"Batman and Robin\" is pretty close. But no, I've actually finished worse movies than this. Thing is, in those movies I held out hope that they would get better before the end. With Dumb and Dumberer, there was no such hope. In fact, there was utterly no hope at all.\n\nI did get a chuckle from a couple moments though. Like when the two titular characters walk down the school hallway with their Special Ed class to the theme from the A-Team, and... well, that's it actually.\n\nOh yeah, Mimi Rogers made out with a little hottie named Rachel Nichols.\n\nThe most notable thing about Nichols, other than her being very attractive, is that she's in the new Bruce Campbell film \"The Woods\" which is currently in post production.\n\nApart from that \"Dumb and Dumberer\" can be summed up by the fact that I actually got up off my couch to remove this ultra-boring, ultra-unfunny piece of cinematic spam from the DVD player.\n\nPS: I did put it back in to check the not-so 'Special Features', but I did not find the apology I was looking for.\n\nMaybe it's an 'Easter Egg'.\n\nI don't recommend checking yourselves, but if someone finds it, please let me know. I feel it's owed to me."

Unfortunately, I'll probably never complete the list, as a couple of the remaining films are Turkish and one is German...and it's highly unlikely they'll bother captioning films hated this much by the audiences. For me, \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\" is the 95th film I've seen...a dubious accomplishment, I know.\n\nThe original \"Dumb and Dumber\" was a silly but mildly enjoyable film (I just rewatched it). And, the studio came up with a brilliant idea....since they couldn't get Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey for a sequel (or, more likely they didn't want to PAY them for a sequel), they made a prequel with unknown actors playing the leads. The fans were NOT amused.\n\nThe story begins long before \"Dumb and Dumber\" and near the very beginning, Harry and Lloyd* bump into each other for the first time. Soon they are buddies and soon the pair are assigned to the school's new fake special needs class. This is because the evil principal (Eugene Levy....who is just too good for films like this) wants to create a fake special needs class to get additional funding...which he can embezzle. Instead of a real classroom, it's in a shed and the lunch lady is in charge....and soon Harry and Lloyd sign up several other students for the class. Will the Principal be able to get away with this case of fraud?\n\nSo is any of this funny? Not especially. Mostly it's annoying and occasionally offensive (such as how they deal with mental disabilities as well as the MANY sexist jokes). This isn't too surprising since it is on the list AND the original folks who made the film had nothing to do with this project. However, it's not among the very worst films I've seen and I think it made the list mostly because compared to the original film it was an unfunny abomination.\n\n*FYI, the actors appear to be about 25...a bit old for high school. But a lot of the 'students' in the movie appear to be quite old as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd is really just a dumb comedy, the only problem is that it isn't funny. It's the first day of high school and Harry, who previously has been home schooled by his mother, needs someone to show him the ropes. Lloyd, who lives in the school's basement with his adoptive dad/school custodian Ray, turns out to be just the guy. They unknowingly fall into the web of the corrupt Principal Collins and his girlfriend, head lunch lady Ms. Heller, who want them to be the first students in a phony \"special needs\" class in order to bilk $100,000 in grant money for themselves. Harry and Lloyd go out to look for more students for this new class, they catch the attention of Jessica Matthews, a hard-hitting reporter for the school's newspaper, who suspects foul play. The plot sounds like it has some potential but the execution is very bad. This has to be the most pointless film of 2003 and one of the least funniest as well. Most of the jokes just fall flat and apparently the filmmakers weren't trying at all. I can see now why Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels backed out of this one. They are replaced by Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson. Derek and Eric both play their roles dumb, they just try to hard most of the time and aren't funny. Eugene Levy is embarrassingly bad and this has to be his worst film ever. Mimi Roger's role is small but its nice to see her on screen. She is also one of the few saving graces in this film. The rest of the cast is mostly unfunny except for Bob Saget who does have some funny moments. Troy Miller does a poor job of directing and writing as he didn't seem to really put a lot effort in. People are defending this film, saying that you can't take every film seriously. I wasn't taking this film seriously and it still wasn't very funny. There might had been a laugh here or there but that's it. The original was fine and didn't need a prequel to explain what happened before and this film just ruins the original. The running time is also a good thing as its only 82 minutes long though sometimes it feels longer. Is this film better then the original? No, not even close and this comedy should be forgotten. In the end, this film is not worth the time or money to watch and its better if you just skip this. Rating 3.3/10, rent the original instead."

Only problem is, the guys in that movie looked pretty dumb but at the same time sympathetic, and you wanted good things to happen to them. The guys in this one look like they've just peed their pants. Like, all the time. The only direction the actors got must have been like, stare blankly into space and be loud and annoying and high-pitched. I can't remember any jokes in this entire movie, I suppose there were some but I have blocked them from my mind. Well, there is one scene that comes to mind, in which the low-budget Jim Carrey sits in a hot tub and farts. Sounds promising, no? I've witnessed comedy's rock bottom. It wasn't pretty."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of those films that will astound you in that it actually got made. The script and direction here are poor and some of the 'comedic' performances are non-existent. But then again dialogue wise nobody has really anything to work with. The first film was made on the basis of a strong script. This sorry mess is made simply on the basis of a 'good' idea (that being lets cash in on the first one).\n\nThe studio probably commissioned this after seeing only a treatment or maybe even just a pitch which probably went something like \"Dumb and Dumber made a lot of money. Lets make another one\". If that's the case then they should have got some performers who are good at improvisation but alas.\n\nTo the film itself.....the leads do a good impersonation of Carey and Daniels but lack the comedic flair and material. It must have been a tough job I admit but the Loyd Christmas character struggles to get any laughs at all. The Harry take-off fairs better though. The one scene in the film which had me laughing was set in the school babe's house when she invites Harry round for dinner. But this was about the only one which had the whole audience, or indeed even part of it, going. It involved some pretty base toilet humour but in this movie you take the chuckles where you can. As for the plot. What can I say?! Its a prequel to the aforementioned original set during the terrible twosome's school years. And really that's about as much info as you need in terms of the character's motivations.\n\nIn regards to the other more notable cast members present here Eugene Levy stole the show in 'American Pie' but most of his scenes here stink of being painfully under-written. He almost looks embarrassed to be in it. Also the rest of the kids in the special needs class just ain't funny. For a start they don't actually do anything and when they do get screen time they are about as charismatic as a career stoner. And when we find out that the Asian foreign exchange student is actually American the general reaction is not laughter but more wondering 'Who is she again?' I don't know why Mimi Rogers and Luis Guzman are in this. Their roles are small and uninteresting. I think that's meant to be the joke. Ha, Ha. Also that Loyd's dad(Guzman) is an Hispanic for some unexplained reason. Wacky! The role that must get the most criticism though is that of the store clerk. This guy's timing and general acting, if you could call it that, are just terrible. He stinks the house out . I can only imagine that they found him on the street and were unlucky to uncover America's worst performer. I mean what kind of audition , if any, did he go through for this? He has a gratingly monotone voice and a face you would like to hit.\n\nIn summary: you can see 90% of the laughs coming and when they do come they ain't funny; the ending has huge plot holes in it that are never explained(I know. I may have taken it a bit too seriously) and even the out-takes struggle to raise a snigger. The film has the same poor pacing and direction of 'Dude.Where's my car?' but is even less funny than that piece of $h!t. 3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Want to hear something funny? I laughed at \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd.\" In fact, at about four scenes I was rolling over in laughter. And not just me -- people in front of and behind me were roaring in laughter, too.\n\nIt's not a good movie. But I have seen far worse. Yes, the movie is filmed in the distinct style of a bad movie. It has a bad script. Most of its jokes are bad. It's essentially a bad movie. But it's not awful. And when I left, I had a smile on my face, because I had expected a depressing comedy and I got a goofy, good-natured one with a few good gags and a lot of good spirit. In its essence, it is quite easy to watch and -- perhaps -- just a little bit fun.\n\nI say this not out of prior prejudice, as much as I may have enjoyed the first installment, but out of surprise, because I expected it to give a bad name to the first film, \"Dumb and Dumber\" (1994). I read all the bad reviews before going into \"Dumb and Dumberer.\" I didn't expect to laugh a single minute time, and I expected it to be a pale imitation of its predecessor.\n\nI did laugh. Not much, but I did. And it's not a pale imitation of the first film--it isn't nearly as solid in direction (thanks to the absence of the Farrelly Brothers), but this is a good thing. I don't think it wanted to try to be like the first film, because it knew that it couldn't be and never would be. So it's just a sappy little 90-minute movie with a few good gags and a notably convincing portrayal of a younger Jim Carrey (or Lloyd Christmas) from Eric Christian Olsen. His face is often contorted with an arched eyebrow. To those who said he didn't look like Jim Carrey: Shame on you. He's even got the movements and physical gestures down pat.\n\nIt's 1986. Lloyd (Olsen) lives with his stepfather (Luis Guzman), the local high school janitor. Rushing to catch the bus for school one day, he turns around a corner and (literally) bumps into Harry Dunne (Derek Richardson), a homeschooler whose first day of school begins on that very day. Lloyd gets his tooth chipped when they bump into each other and immediately they are best pals.\n\nAs Lloyd shows Harry the ropes at school, Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) sets up a \"special needs\" program at the school as a way of cheating his way to a 100,000 dollar grant from a pay program, which -- unbeknownst to him -- is all just an FBI sting. The cafeteria cook (Chery Oteri), who is also Collins' lover, plays teacher to Harry, Lloyd and a band of other \"special\" kids. Meanwhile, Harry and Lloyd's friendship starts to blossom.\n\nYou want to know the scene that had my hysterically laughing in this film? It's the most juvenile scene in the entire movie, and I know this, but it was great. Bob Saget (\"Full House\") plays the uptight father of Jessica, Harry's wannabe love interest. Invited to dinner at their house, Harry accidentally spreads melted chocolate all over the bathroom wall. After leaving, Saget walks in and sees it, completely freaks out, and starts to curse up a storm. Let's just say that he thinks it is something other than chocolate covering his bathroom.\n\nI cherish \"Dumb and Dumber,\" the original, because I find its buddies lovable and its goofiness contagious. I am a big fan of the buddy movie sub genre, specifically the Odd Couple stuff. \"Dumb and Dumberer\" is not in its league. It's too childish, too crude, too immature, too plain stupid. But y'know what? It sure is a lot dumber than the first film. Perhaps even dumberer. Like I said above, after reading the negative press about this film I really expected a shameless cash-in on the original. In a way, that's what I got. But I admire this film's spirit. It knows it's nothing great. And it didn't harm me, despite all its crude humor and childish jokes. In a way, it's almost admirable because the director, Troy Miller, managed to create a film that plastered a goofy little grin on my face without disgusting me like \"Daddy Day Care\" did, a \"family\" comedy minus the laughs. This one works, in an odd sort of way. And, for once, a film title lives up to its name. This movie is certainly dumberer than the first.\n\nNote: I seem to be praising this film. I'm not. It is merely a mediocre comedy. I withhold its flaws in my review specifically because it surprised me very much and, despite being an undoubtedly bad movie, I don't necessarily find it harmful in any way, shape or form. It's a goofy little comedy with a smaller heart than the first but a heart nevertheless. I give it a bad rating because it trips more than it succeeds. But I will add a disclaimer to this review: It's not as bad as you think...and you may be surprised. This film puts a small little smile on your face."

It's a cheap insult to the movie going public. You saw the first Dumb and Dumber, and that was funny. I was laughing so hard during the bathroom scene that I was worried I would hurt myself. So after having seen the first one, you gotta go see the sequel, and the movie executives know this. They knew that just the title alone would fill a lot of seats, and they made absolutely no effort to make a decent movie.\n\nThroughout the movie I sat there. The lady I was with wanted to walk out. I paid $7 for myself and another $7 for her, and I'll be doggoned if I wasn't going to get at least one laugh out of it. I sat through the whole movie hoping that I would get at least a chuckle. After the first few minutes I knew I wasn't going to get a laugh worth $14, but I at least wanted something for that kind of bread. I didn't get it. I never laughed once. When I came out, not only was I disappointed but my lady friend was angry with me. I don't know what they could have done to make this movie worse."

And what the **** was up with Lloyd's father being a Spanish janitor?????? I was So confused! This \"movie\" (if it can even be called a movie) had a horrible plot, horrible acting, and it was just down right not funny. I was actually sobbing to see such a classic movie like Dumb and Dumber being demolished into oblivion! This movie is not even worth watching for free!!!! This movie is a complete waste of time!!! DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! Trust me on movies!!! i am a huge fan of movies and i know what i am talking about when i criticize movies!!! If you read my other comments after watching the movies i commented, you will agree!!! Do Not Watch This Movie!!!"

So I was excited the whole summer, then saw the movie, and it just stunk. If you want to watch this movie because of the original, forget it...it's not worth it. I will give the new movie another shot and see if it's still as bad or not, but I expect it will still suck. There were some funny parts, the bus was great. Bob saget and the American Pie dad were cool too. The guys who played Harry and Lloyd did a good job with their characters, but the movie just wasn't good and not all that funny"

I know there a lot of people who really hated this film and generally I agree with the majority on when a film is not good. This time I must disagree. It was very entertaining.

It is bad, but I'm sure there are many films far above it that deserve its place at the bottom much, much more.\n\nDumb and Dumberer could never hope to compete with its predecessor but its no worse really than any other teen-comedy-high-school nonsense. If the original movie had not been made, then this one wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the bad press it has. But, alas, it was not to be, and so this film will slip into obscurity like many ill-conceived sequels, destined to be forgotten, or talked about with ill-disguised scorn when reminiscing over the original movie.\n\nThe best way to watch this film (if you have to at all) is to try and forget the characters Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels made their own, and view it as if that first film had never happened. Also, console yourself whilst watching that there are a few bloopers tacked onto the end that are the comedic highlight of this unfunny movie, although its really not worth watching the film just for them. You might then get some enjoyment out of an otherwise bland film.\n\nIn summary then, its bad but not really deserving a place in the worst 100 of IMDb."

A cult classic to me, especially if you like the dumb n dumber movieS. I encourage you to watch n choose for yourself. This movie also has a great soundtrack in my mind. Great film all around!!

The genius of the Farrelly Brothers' characters is that, while not particularly bright (and who doesn't know people like that?), Harry & Lloyd's friendship is both touching and funny. In this prequel, it is sad and disgraceful. This is too bad since so many obvious comedic talents are wasted - Eugene Levy, Cheri Oteri, and Bob Saget particularly (although it was a treat to hear squeaky-clean Saget screaming \"Sh*t!\" over and over - in outtakes he tries the word \"poop\" instead, but it isn't nearly as funny). When Harry Met Lloyd deserved so much better than this. I've often wished the Farrellys would make a sequel to \"Dumb and Dumber\". How about \"Dumbing Down\" - with Harry & Lloyd in Washington? Or should that be called \"Dumb and Dubya\"?"

The only funny thing about the film is the presence of Bob Saget, who plays the stuffy, put-upon father of the love interest that Lloyd and Harry both have eyes for and his character hates any form of fecal matter.

        "review_detailed_main": "Granted the plot was not as good as Dumb and Dumber, nor were the jokes, but it was watchable. I don't think that the younger Harry and Lloyd had quite the chemistry as the older two did, but they made it work. I must say that I was impressed with the acting jobs of Eric Christian Olsen (Lloyd) and Derek Richardson (Harry), they did a heck of a job emulating Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels.\n\nThere were flashes of comedic brilliance throughout the movie making it very reminiscent of its predecessor, but there were just too many weak points. I think the weakness came from the lack of a fixed goal for Harry and Lloyd. In Dumb and Dumber you knew that their purpose was to deliver a briefcase to a woman in Aspen Colorado, so no matter what happened throughout the movie you knew what they were trying to accomplish. In Dumb and Dumberer they don't have a similar fixed goal.\n\nThe movie was not worth my $8 but it was good enough for an average rating, nothing less."

However, it is a hideous disappointment. It's so bad it's embarrassing. There isn't a single laugh in it. I feel sorry for the people who went to see it because they liked Dumb & Dumber - I imagine it left a bitter taste in quite a few mouths.\n\nThe makers must have known it was going to bomb so hard, which makes me wonder how it ever got released. I can only imagine that it was a cynical attempt to make some easy money."

Usually this incorporation was either wrong or poorly timed. Granted the one good line from the film \"Chicks are for fags\" is kinda funny, they tried to use it twice, since there were so few other lines that were memorable. Maybe the next best line was Bob Sagget's tirade of \"You got poo all over my car\" and \"You got poo all over my bathroom.\"\n\nAs a huge fan of the first film, I am glad I saw this film, but it was so bad that I had to come home and watch the original another time to make up for it.\n\nI don't plan on buying this film on DVD, but I will probably watch it again when it comes on cable.\n\nIf you do need to see this film, see it at the matinee, at least save yourself a few bucks.\n\nThe best thing about it was Eric Christian Olsen. He did a very good job imitating Jim Carey, and I predict that he has a nice future ahead of him in either films or comedy skits."

At first It is not funny at all, its humour is to stupid for even a 10 year old child. I know that the first dumb and dumber hasn't the most original nor the cleverest comedic quotes or scenes,but at list the fun is not force and when you laugh its real. Secondary the characters are not likable at all, they are horrible people who if you meet you would try your best afterwords to forget that they exist at all.Lastly the directing is ,for a lack of a better world ,awful. In conclusion here dear readers we have a prime example of a film which was made in order to steal money of the audience using a previous hit as a starting point for a possible cash cow of a franchise, likely the film-goes were smarter than that and the film failed big time."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie flat out sucks. There's no other, smart guy way to put it. Its horrible. Its the worst prequel I've ever seen, the jokes are pure, raw slapstick in it's lowest possible form, and the two leads may look like Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, but there's no way in hell they could pull it off like they did in 1994. Also, if you're going to make a prequel, set in 1986, use stuff in 1986. We see new dollar bills and the most fatal flaw is the song \"Ice Ice Baby\" by Vanilla Ice. The song came out in 1990 and this is set in 1986. Sense? Nada. This movie was clearly rushed, not thought over properly, and serves no purpose.\n\nLets begin with the cover for the DVD. If you closely at Lloyds tooth it is clear that the left corner is just drawn with Sharpie marker or some dry erase marker to look as if it was missing. Nothing says a movie is worse than when the cover doesn't even look believable. A poor entrance to a poor movie. Fits perfectly.\n\nBefore Harry and Lloyd where the best of dumb buddies, they were in high school struggling to make the grade. Now we get to the moment they first met by bumping heads. Harry was homeschooled and is now attending regular school. Upon meeting Lloyd whom gives him a half assed tour of the school, they now become the best of friends and are inseparable. After a class opens called \"The Special Needs\" class, Harry and Lloyd are asked to get people to attend. A good girl Jessica finds out why the lunch lady would be teaching a class and she soon discovers that the principal and the teacher for the fake Specials class are stealing money from the school and it's now up to Harry, Lloyd, and Jessica to stop them.\n\nSince the movie is supposed to be focused on the stupid characters of Harry and Lloyd, I shouldn't say this, but need to. It gets incredibly aggravating because the stupidity of the characters makes the movie move in a slow pace and even though its a mere 86 minutes it feels way longer. Harry and Lloyd are portrayed as stupid beyond belief. There's no way anyone in the world could be this stupid and not be mentally challenged. Its an insult.\n\nI too find it absolutely hilarious that the cameo appearance by Bob Saget is funnier than the two leads in the movie. Bob Saget's cameo is nowhere near as funny to earn this movie an extra star, but its damn sure funny to earn it probably the most memorable thing about this movie. Julia Duffy doesn't do much in the movie, but I remember her as Mrs. Hayfer in Drake & Josh. Those will be the only two people who I cite as a \"decent job done\" in this movie. Eugene Levy is awful in this movie and so are the actors who portray Harry and Lloyd. Luis Guzm\u00e1n also does a poor job in this as well.\n\nI thought I'd approach this film with an open mind and have a decent attitude and relate it to something me and my friend do. I like a lot of stupid movies like Bio-Dome, but this just completely blew my mind. From the DVD menu gags to the \"Dont press this button\" joke on there as well I knew this movie was going to be no more than two stars if they found burping and farting to be the most hilarious joke on the planet. Sure enough I was right. Worst prequel to any movie and awful movie all together.\n\nStarring: Eric Christian Olsen, Derek Richardson, Rachel Nichols, Bob Saget, Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Eugene Levy, and Mimi Rogers."

The only recognizable actor in the film is Eugene Levy, none of the others are memorable.\n\nThe story is ridiculous, nothing at all like the film it's based on (which had a solid script). The writers and director of this train wreck rely on making fun of the less fortunate and mentally challenged. The only connection the Farrelly brothers have is that they created th characters of Lloyd and Harry. It's hard to believe they allowed this film to see the light of day!\n\nDumb and Dumberer is honestly the stupidest film of the 2000s decade. If you really want to see this, it's probably available at your local Walmart in the cheap dvd bin."

And I failed. Just couldn't do it. I made it 45 minutes.\n\nLucky me for not renting this movie - my step-son did and i burrowed it. I asked my stepson before watching this one what he thought and he said it was ok but not funny. Should have gotten the clue.\n\nAfter watching the first 45 minutes I said ENOUGH and decided to watch the extra features. I'd get more background on why this movie was made and get clips of the parts I didn't watch. The funniest parts were supposed to be in the beginning - of which I saw and didn't laugh. A part where both characters play tag in a 7-11 type store and those same characters drinking a slurpee and getting brain freeze. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. What has become of todays comedy? It's all about cheap humor and is so unoriginal.\n\nSo back to the extra features, the people who made this movie in the extra features acted like they had somekind of comedic masterpiece here. They say they were looking for people who were funny and just didn't do impressions. Well all you get here is impersonations that were not funny.\n\nI've wasted enough time here on this one. My review is to hopefully save others from watching this. Please, don't even rent this one if you know what is good for you - it's in the bottom 100 for a reason. That's it - goal achieved."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw Dumb and Dumberer on opening night. I entered the theater with a highly skeptical attitude toward this prequel to a classic movie that I love for its total randomness, stupid hilarity and countless other details Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels brought to the part. The movie began with some of the most terrifically horrible ads I've ever seen in my life, and I was losing hope for this movie rapidly if this was how they were going to front the audience before playing it. And then it began...and I was extremely impressed! The actors sincerely looked and acted like teenage versions of they're predecessors, and as such a great on screen team the laughs never subsided when Lloyd and Harry were in the scene.\n\nI found only a few faults that would irritate the average movie-goer and criticizer of this movie, as they bugged me ever since I left the theater. One is that Lloyd, Jim Carrey's old part, is very controlling of Harry and is a 'jerk' the majority of the way through the movie, which really got on my nerves. In addition, Harry seemed too laid back and just let Lloyd treat him somewhat negatively. Also, there was almost no plot line! In the first 1994 movie there was an ultimate goal, a reason for the movie. In this prequel, there was one but it seemed as though New Line Cinema Stuck it in there just for spite. Thirdly, they didn't film it in the same way as the first! In Dumb and Dumber, every place the characters went, several funny things happened there that the viewer remembered later as the 'Cafe scene' or the 'beer scene'...In Dumb and DumberER, each clipping was significantly shorter, leaving the audience to figure out later what happened or why something occured, which is, in truth, an insanely poor movie-making technique that irritates.\n\nBesides those problems, however, and despite this movie being very different than its well-loved predecessor,it's hilarious! Many parts I found myself not able to breathe from laughing so hard, and maybe you need to be a teenager as I am to fully comprehend the jokes, but it was hilarious in its own way. This is a movie you'll want to take your crew of friends to and laugh at all the sickening stupidity and overall dumbererness of the first adventures, when Harry met Lloyd. I was impressed as it excelled past the standards I set for this flick, and maybe you will think so as well. Give it a try and go see it! An 8 out of 10 stars. Fantastically humorous and, well..dumb!"

In order to pull the scam off they need to put together a special needs class. They enlist Harry and Lloyd to pick the other students for the special class. Another student Jessica, who writes for the school newspaper is suspicious of this new special needs class and aims to get to the bottom of what exactly is going on with the help of Lloyd and Harry.\n\nI think people dog on this movie because of how popular the original Dumb and Dumber is. This isn't in the same league, but all things considered it's a fairly decent film with some good laughs. There's a couple of humorous scenes with Bob Saget. I recommend this over Dumb and Dumber To."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is very strange that when I read the user reviews of this site, so few actually talk about why the movie is so bad. Well, I'd like to take a moment to say why I didn't, and in better detail than most, hopefully, enjoy the movie.\n\nDumb and Dumberer is a prequel, which if the word \"sequel\" is of any indication, means it is a continuation from the first. Well, \"Prequel\" implies it as a \"beginning of\" story, sort of what happened in the childhoods of Harry and Lloyd, who were originally played by Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey, respectively.\n\nThe characters in the story are Harry and Lloyd, two simple minded teenagers, who lack any real charm or clever idiocy that was played so well in the original. The idea in this movie is that the principal, played by the legendary Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad in American Pie and most of its sequels) is trying to find a get rich quick scheme, so he develops a special needs class to make the money, but he needs students.\n\nIf that part of the plot doesn't offend you, don't worry, the rest will.\n\nHarry and Lloyd go on a search to find kids who are just like them, (although its so insulting to think special needs kids can't tell an Asian girl from a mentally handicapped child) and needless to say, a class is formed.\n\nJessica, a very smart teenage girl (which only implies the entire school isn't smart enough to recognize this plot) sees the ruse, and uses our heroes to dig up the dirt on the principal.\n\nTo be honest, if the movie didn't have the \"Dumb and Dumber\" moniker or even a mentioning of Harry and Lloyd, this movie probably would have faded into obscurity, nary, even been made, and if it did, it might have been a cult classic if it had been better written and not as relying on the first movie's jokes.\n\nThe movie has some references to the original picture, but the problem is that references aren't usually funny. So when this movie references the laxative from the original as a large truck carrying said product, it doesn't make it funny, you are just implying that you watched the movie enough to notice it.\n\nThe problem with this movie is just lazy writing. The creators probably thought watching enough of the original was a good idea to create a sequel, but what it does is insult anyone who tries really hard to write good comedy with insulting retreads from classic movies.\n\nHarry and Lloyd aren't some kind of smart, they are all kinds of moron. In the original, it is implied they aren't smart, but in reality, it's that their ideas of intelligence is slightly askew from most people, but it was mostly honest mistakes. Lloyd hearing the country Austria and playing it off as Australia is believable, and more than likely a mistake a person has made before, as opposed to say, talking about who Benjamin Franklin is (Where Lloyd explains that Ben Franklin was the \"Pilgrim who invented Penicillin and defeated Godzilla\").\n\nCritics and most writers will tell you that was is usually funny isn't funny, it's what you play off as serious that's funny. The characters aren't serious people doing funny things, they are played off as funny people doing funny things, and that doesn't always equal funny.\n\nThe actors seem rather detached from the project, as if they all simultaneously had a large bill to pay, so they played their appropriate roles just to pay it off to do better movies. It was strange that from the years 2003 and 2005, people thought that making sequels to previous Jim Carrey movies was to be cinematic gold, was actually just copper painted up and advertised as gold.\n\nIt is always going to be argued that sequels are never better than their original counterparts, and that's understandable, only so many movies have that bragging right. That doesn't mean if you have an idea for a sequel and you feel strongly in making a sequel that you have to do it poorly in every means possible: in writing, in acting, in character development, music, staffing, ETC. It should be room to improve. A sequel, in particular, a prequel should challenge the audience to see how the characters became who they are when we remember them, not putting them in a less than original story.\n\nThis concludes my review, I give it a 2/10."

This movie should be in the bottom 100 and I don't know why its not? Easily one of the worst movies ever made. Don't fall for the commercials and torture yourself by seeing this movie.

The two individuals are seen by many as 'special', and become best friends as soon as they meet. Principal Collins and his lover, the lunch lady, Ms. Heller want to make as much money out of scams, and their next idea is to create a special needs class. Ms. Heller is the teacher, and they have assigned Harry and Lloyd to round the special students up. School News Reporter Jessica is suspicious though, and desperately tries to find out the truth, even if it means gaining Harry and Lloyd's help.\n\nOK, where do i start? If you was a huge fan of 'Dumb and Dumber' then i advise you to stay clear from this. If you liked the original, and is just interested in what the prequel contains, then don't go into this viewing with high hopes. To sum up this film is one word, i would use 'bad'. Just plain bad. The main problem with this film is the jokes. There is a story but only a very basic story, and the jokes are focused on innuendos, which sounds as if they were written by 12 year old's. Although some of us might have been 12 when the original film came out, we would definitely not be 12 now. Innuendos jokes just does not make a film good, especially when the innuendos jokes aren't even that good. The acting is OK. There impersonations of Harry and Lloyd are not exactly perfect, but they do a good job. The rest of the cast are OK. Seeing Eugene Levy and Cheri Oteri in a scene together, did actually make me chuckle a little, but Eugene Levy should have known better to pick a role like this. There are the few other good appearances from stars such as Shia LaBeouf, Mimi Rogers and Lin Shaye. Still, if i was you, i would only watch it for the performance of a specific actor.\n\n\"Come on out, you little b******.\" - Doctor (Timothy Stack)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was a big fan of the original. I think I laughed more at it's mindless humour than I did at any other movie I can recall. Admittedly, I was 12 at the time, but have seen it more recently in my adult years and was still highly entertained.\n\nSo I was looking forward to this. The trailer promised more of the mindless action provided by the first film and the characters Harry and Lloyd looked well cast.\n\nThat was where the positives ended really. As well cast as Harry and Lloyd were - Eric Christian Olsen was excellent and true to Jim Carrey's original portrayl of Lloyd - there is nothing they could do to rescue a diabolical script and storyline.\n\nPart of the humour of the first was that only Harry and Lloyd were that ridiculously idiotic. They were misunderstood by a believable world. This was part of the strength of the first, which allowed for an excellent story line and some near-water inducing situations. But such clever circumstances are left well behind in this prequel.\n\nEverybody is an idiot in this movie and that immediately impacts on the humour potential. If anything, the poor and corny quips from the supporting cast detract from the movie. Ms. Heller (Cheri Oteri) comes across as even more stupid than the two main characters. Such ridiculous but plot-centric concepts as Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) keeping all the evidence of his crimes, needed to bury him in jail for life, baffle the mind for their awful stupidity. Even the funnier moments wear out quickly - somebody can only think chocolate is poo for so long.\n\nPerhaps I'm doing this movie a disservice, but I'm not. There are a few laughs, however they are few and far between. The plot is substandard. There are none of the classic settings, for Lloyd and Harry to create carnage in, that were in abundance in the first movie. The directing is poor and misses many things (like the 90s cars and songs in a movie set in 1986).\n\nThis calamity of a prequel is no fault of the actors. Most of the major characters do as well as could be expected with what is just a lame script. Even the end of movie 'girls in need' part is pathetic.\n\nThis movie was abysmal. The only reason it gets above a 0 is because Harry and Lloyd were well portrayed and managed to provide an occasional laugh despite the script/director's best attempts. You'd have to be seriously devoid of comedy in your life to find this movie funny.\n\nIt just doesn't belong in the same video store as the original. 1/5."

It was one of the most poorly written, thrown together for profit piece of trash ever. The jokes were recycled, the acting left much desired for(with the exception of Richardson), and even Eugene Levy's part wasn't funny. Levy is a great actor who can be very funny and this movie didn't utilize his talent at all. They made the characters appear to be retarded instead of just dumb (what's so funny about that!?), they made Lloyd come off gay which he wasn't in the original. Lloyd's dad was ridiculous and not in the good way.\n\nTo make up for jokes, talent and creativity, they inserted music montages throughout using footage you JUST saw 5-10 min earlier. This movie has nothing to do with Dumb and Dumber. It's completely terrible and not worth seeing. I'm angry that they tried to franchise the coolest movie ever into this rubbish. Thumbs down."

There was basically no story, and the only part that I laughed at was a scene where Bob Saget makes a cameo. Most of the movie even followed the structure of the first, including the ending! This certainly ranks as the most unnecessary prequel ever made. Now I know why Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey stayed away from this project. A definite candidate for the worst movie of the year."

But if you're expecting the unique type of humor the Farrellys and Carrey are famous for, you'll be disappointed simply because this just isn't them.

        "review_detailed_main": "The prequel to the 1994 comedy hit Dumb & Dumber is set in 1986 when Harry Dunne and Lloyd Christmas (Derek Richardson and Eric Christian Olsen) were in high school. Due to their tremendously stupid behaviour they are put in a special education class that the school's principal Collins (Eugene Levy) has created in order to embezzle the money meant for advancing the special students' rights. The shady actions of the principal are being investigated by a smart but good-looking student named Jessica (Rachel Nichols), who also evokes feelings in both Harry and Lloyd.\n\nAs Dumb and Dumberer is a prequel, it's only natural that neither Jim Carrey nor Jeff Daniels of the original movie reprises their roles. Instead, Richardson and Olsen try to emulate the original actors' styles, but since they haven't got the natural aura of comedy like Carrey and Daniels do, the result is just painfully unfunny. Both protagonists, especially Harry, are essentially retards whose constant yelling and bantering is nothing but irritating. Olsen's attempts of capturing Carrey's trademark facial expressions are probably the best thing about the performances, but that is a very, very faint praise. One can only wonder how a talented supporting actor like Luis Guzm\u00e1n ended up in a movie like this.\n\nAs opposed to the road trip theme of Dumb & Dumber, the jokes in the prequel are largely based on tired high school stereotypes, so it must have been difficult to come up with anything we haven't already seen many times, if the writers ever even tried to achieve anything that ambitious. Plenty of sex jokes and toilet humour are also present, and while one gross-out scene actually is funny, the premise of the joke is essentially recycled from the first movie, raising even more questions about the point of this movie's existence. In addition, the film comes across as mocking and mean-spirited towards real-life special education students. As not even the blooper reel over the end credits is funny, Dumb and Dumberer seriously cannot be recommended to anyone but the most undemanding of comedy fans, if even them. The rest of us should just avoid it altogether."

        "review_detailed_main": "Going into this film, I thought it would be a little risky to make a prequel to a film entitled Dumb and Dumber; especially with the gap between films a whole nine years. The reason I thought it'd be risky is because the recent spate of sequels, prequels, remakes and so forth hasn't exactly been a success story so another helping to two misfits in their younger years in a film entitled Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd could've been a disaster.\n\nIt's probably been said before but few films actually come close to having their titles describe them - Dumb and Dumberer does this. Some other films that have done so could include Scary Movie (although that wasn't too scary) and Epic Movie (although by sounds of things, that wasn't too epic). One thing all these films have in common in the long run is that they're all failed comedies. Dumb and Dumberer isn't just a failed comedy; it's an insult to a number of things, one of which is us, the viewers. The reoccurring joke in Dumb and Dumberer is that of the mocking of people with disabilities or special needs. People who find it difficult to learn at the same speed or are 'below' the average when it comes to day to day skills are the overall butt of jokes in Dumb and Dumberer and it's difficult to watch at times. This is probably Dumb and Dumberer's biggest error.\n\nIt's not just people with disabilities that are targeted but they do get a pretty rough time. One person thinks Marco Polo invented the swimming pool; he also thinks George Washington invented money since the guy's face is all over it. But no: the crippled, the foreign and women in general are targeted in such a way; even mildly smirking at it could be considered a crime. A Chinese girl doesn't speak much English: she's special; a guy with a broken arm is useless: he's special and the way the women (the mother character, the female student Jessica and Principal Collins' (Levy) scenes with Ms. Heller (Oteri)) are treated is extremely disrespectful and sexist. Jessica (Nichols) is put across as a prize to be won but it later turns out she has a boyfriend and merely runs off to him whenever the situation calls for it, Ching Chong (Krusiec) despite having a ridiculous name eventually tells everyone she can speak English (why she kept it a secret, I don't know) but goes right back to submissive, dumb Chinese girl who \"don't speekee Inglish\" on a male's demand.\n\nThe film also lacks any sort of a story and thus; doesn't have that much conflict, it's just making fun of these different groups. Whatever conflict there is, is so watered down and weak, it's incredible. The Principal and a teacher want to stiff the school and its special needs department just so they can run off together to Hawaii; that's it. They conduct this evil scheme that just isn't really that evil; we realise they're not likable people but because you have no caring towards the people they're trying to stiff you don't really care. Although one or two situations arise that are funny such as the melted chocolate scene and the window exchange scene where Lloyd transports a convocation to Jessica through Harry who's actually talking to a stray dog, the bulk of the humour is either unfunny slapstick or of the racist/sexist/disabilities mocking variety.\n\nI wasn't really engaged by the film in fact I felt sorry for Harry and Lloyd more than anything and wanted them to succeed through pity than anything else. I really liked the way Derek Richardson and Eric Christian Olsen were made to look like Carrey and Daniels from the first film \u0096 that was impressive but this is real borderline trash with no laughs and pretty damned offensive material which will only encourage children to act against foreign people, girls and people with disabilities in a negative way should they see it."

Next to remakes, lame sequels is one of the worst things i know.\n\nRight from the start it's obvious that this movie has absolutely nothing to offer in way of comedy. I read in the trivia that most of the cast were chosen on the grounds that they were \"huge Dumb & Dumber fans\". I'm not surprised. This movie is simply put what you get if you lock a bunch of talentless retards in a room and loop Dumb & Dumber. We have a duo of \"actors\" (and i use the term loosely here) acting the parts Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels had in the original. And watching them act is like seeing 10-year old kids in front of a mirror making faces and trying desperately to sound like their idols. Sure i have a laugh with my friends quoting movies, sure i sometimes say \"Like a glove!\" to myself when i park the car trying to sound like Jim Carrey... Most people do stuff like this. Most people however don't record it on film and try to sell it as a sequel to their favorite movies! Of course the biggest flaw is still not the crappy actors or the complete lack of comedy in both script and acting. Rather it's the complete lack of understanding for what made the first movie such a success. I know a lot of people who loathe silly comedy who still like \"Dumb & Dumber\". Why? Because the Farrelly brothers have an uncanny sense when it comes to making their oddball characters lovable in a strange way. There is a warmth in the portrayal even when they are at their most pathetic (or even twisted). Of course that is completely missing here, just like everything else that makes a movie good...\n\nEven though expectations were abysmally low this movie still managed to put them to shame. I rate this 1/10 since that is the lowest grade it's possible to give."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rhose Island, 1969. Harry Dunne (Derek Richardson)was born. It was so funny when he was about to be born, he bit the doctor. And the doctor said that Harry was a baby who liked to play hide and seek and he was a shy one! Eight years later, Harry had an imaginary friend named Captain Rob and the cops always had to save Rob from from the well in Harry's backyard! Ha! Ha! Ha! And ten years later, Harry's mother (Mimi Rogers) sent Harry and Rob on a treasure hunt. And that was, finding the school! Ha!Ha! Lloyd Christmas (Eric Christian Olsen), on the other hand was an adopted child and his father was a janitor of a school. And they together lived in the school.\n\nLloyed and Harry eventually bumped into each other and Lloyd chipped his tooth when they both went around a corner. Harry was running away from a Rot Veiler and Lloyd, however, was looking for the when in fact, he was living in the school! Lloyd had a bully named Turk (Elden Henson) was sure was a real thug! And Lloyd also met a girl named Jessica Mathika (Rachel Nichols). Lloyd and Harry , however, attended special classes which were in the school's cafeteria and was run by the Lunch Lady, Ms.Heller (Cheri Oteri). And Lloyd and Harry had to find students who were \"special\" like them.\n\nLloyd first got a boy with casts named Toby (Josh Braaten), Turk, Carl (William Lee Scott), who injured himself in a Football match, an exchange student named Ching Chong (Michelle Krusiec) and a half horse, half human boy named Lewis (Shia LaBoeuf). They were the \"Special Needs Class Of 1986\".\n\nThey had a kiff bus. It was so hilarious when Jessica was chasing \"The Special Needs Bus\" because, she thought it special. And then, the bus went flying into the air in slow motion and inside, everyone was screaming in a decreased tone. And then , when Jessica went flying into the air, she landed with a thud! Ha!Ha!Ha! It was funny when Harry was spending time with Jessica at her house, Harry thought Jessica was making him hot when in fact , it was the heater which he was sitting on which it making him hot! And then, he went to the bathroom and when he removed his hand from his back pocket, and he sniffed his hand due to it being covered in a brown substance. It was chocolate! Mmm! That is something lovely to snack on when you needed to. And when he removed the rest of the chocolate from his back pocket, he threw it up into the air and, it went everywhere! And he wasn't able to clean it up! Lol.\n\nI was so charmed when Lloyd was talking to a dog when he was outside Jessica's home. And Harry repeated after him: \"Oh, I remember you. How could I forget those hairy nipples?!\" And then Jessica's father, Mr.Walter (Bob Saget) entered the room, he asked Jessica why Harry was talking to Jessica like that. And Jessica said, \"It's because he's special\". Lol! And then! Mr.Walter entered the bathroom and yelled how harry didn't know how to use a toilet when it just chocolate everywhere.Ha!Ha!Ha!\n\nIt was hysterical to see Jessica take on Harry's mother. It was one of Lloyed's dreams about Harry's mom. And who would fall in love with Lloyd. And suddenly, Harry appeared and Harry was shocked to see it!! Lol! Another amusing moment was when Harry thought he found the treasure which he had been looking for all this time when in fact, it was a chest which belonged to Mr.Collins (Eugene Levy), the Headmaster of the school. Collins' chest had the scams. And soon, all the kids of \"The Special Class\" realized this was all a scam! So, to get Collins back, the gang created a huge version of Collins in pirate style and it spoke in Collins voice about his \"Grand Master Plan\". And it sure was the crime of the century! He was trying to make a run off with all the extra money he and Ms.Heller made with that \"Special Class\". The kids weren't even getting an education!\n\nNow, to end this review. I didn't mention all the other laughs in the movie because, they were all clich\u00e9s and I am sure you would recognize where they got the ending for the movie. But anyways, the film still was fun with style. And you could see that they were even worse when they were kids! Ha!Ha!Ha!"

        "review_detailed_main": "When i first heard that there was going to be another \"Dumb and Dumber\" movie, i was really excited, but then i heard that Jim Carrey and Jeff Danials would not be returning, so i figured, this ones gonna suck. So sitting down to watch it i was expecting the worse, but i was delightfully surprised when i found out this movie is actually good. Pretty much all the jokes are funny and there really isn't any sort of lull in the film, like the first one had. The story is simple and the characters are great. All the performances are really great, especially Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson both a very good and pull off a young Harry and Lloyd very well, i found Richardson to get annoying after a while, but Olsen was dead on the entire movie, he is exactly how Jim Carrey used to be (before he left wacky comedies to do more dramas)This kid could be Carrey's son, and could probably pull off young versions of Ace Ventura and The Mask. I predict you'll be seeing more of Mr. Olsen in the future. The other actors in the film were also very good, but the one that stood out most was Eugine Levy, Man, is this guy hillarious or what, just seeing him makes me want to laugh, and he's particularly effective as the principal in the film.\n\nSo basically this isn't the greatest film ever made, but its also not the worst. It does what it sets out to do, which is to provide a few laughs for an hour and a half. If you loved the first then you should for sure check this one out\n\n7/10 stars"

Unfortunately, there's only one word in the English language that could possibly sum up DUMB AND DUMBERER - and it rhymes with kite.\n\nPlotwise, and that's a laughable word to use here, D&D tells the story of how dumbass friends Harry and Lloyd came to meet at high school. Forget the original's gutsy charm; this is a teen gross-out movie along the lines of \"American Pie\" - but as the two main protaganists have the mental age of a five year old (between them) - their goals aren't to lose their virginity or anything adult like that, simply to recruit people to be in their special needs class.\n\nSound fun? I especially like the way that director Troy Miller decided to make Harry and Lloyd unlikeable dur-durs, thereby removing the only possible remaining interest for the audience. In the original, Harry and Lloyd were funny - braindead, for sure, but funny. You wanted to see them succeed in their wholly unattainable goals; here, you're waiting for something bad to happen just to get them off the screen for a few precious minutes.\n\nThe only positive thing about this movie - and it's a very small positive, nowhere near enough to actually go see it - is Eugene Levy as the school's scheming headmaster. Eugene is one of the funniest actors in America at the moment and it's sad to see him in drivel like this. Were it not for his presence, I'd definitely have walked out the cinema mid-movie.\n\nAvoid this, it's the worst movie of the year. * / *****"

Now here is a prequel (the execs probably thought, hey Lucas can do it, how hard can it be) and I think that, if anything else, it is an extremely pale retread/imitation of the original material. I'm not saying the movie is entirely laughless, in fact there were a few moments when I had a chuckle or two or some grins at the reckless ingenuity of the characters' stupidity (there's even one laugh out loud moment inside the \"Special-Needs\" classroom involving a quiet jock when he gets riled up by the other students). The problem lies in that any of the \"original\" jokes or gags have been done in so many other movies it can only be amusing after a while to the most slight of minds...which means that it will at least earn back a little of the money it took to make it. In other words, Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd is precisely for it's target group, and it doesn't aim for anything more or audacious like the original, and there's only a minor curiosity to see these two knuckleheads portray younger versions of Carrey and Lloyd. I didn't hate it, but when I left I wanted at least half of a refund. D+"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Farrelly brothers' first movie, \"Dumb & Dumber\", turned out to be a hit, and has been enjoyed by many people with a sick sense of humour over the years, including me. This prequel, on the other hand, released nine years later, which the Farrelly brothers did not write or direct, turned out to be a flop. While it seems that \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\" is generally considered terrible, I don't think it is, but it's certainly no match for its predecessor.\n\nHarry Dunne is born in 1969, and as he grows up, he is home-schooled by his mother until one year in high school, in the 1980s. This is when his mother finally sends him to regular school. After this happens, he soon meets one of his peers, Lloyd Christmas, and they soon become two very dimwitted friends. Ms. Heller, the school lunch lady, gets Harry and Lloyd to gather some students for a \"special needs\" class, which they will also be in. However, the two pals have no clue that this is all a scam hatched by Ms. Heller and Principal Collins to cheat the school out of enough money to buy a condo in Waikiki! Jessica, a girl that Harry and Lloyd know, however, is suspicious!\n\nYou might think I'm crazy for saying this, but watching \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\" wasn't a completely laugh-free experience for me. I didn't laugh very much, but did at times, such as when Harry is at Jessica's house and gets chocolate all over the bathroom, causing her dad to throw a fit when he sees it, thinking it's feces (yes, that is very immature, it still made me laugh, I can't deny that)! There were also times when I just smiled. However, for the most part, I didn't think it was funny. The last time I watched \"Dumb & Dumber\", I think I had a smile on my face as I started watching, knowing what I was in for, but that wasn't the case with this sequel. Also, the two famous main characters are just not the same.\n\nWhen a movie is as poorly received as this one turned out to be, I usually understand. I wouldn't say I like \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\" too much, my 5/10 rating makes that clear, but the fact that it has gotten more 1/10 votes than any others still makes me feel that I mustn't have seen the same movie. I might even be able to give this movie a 6/10. I guess I'm in the minority of viewers who weren't absolutely disgusted by this 2003 flop, but I still don't think it's really that good overall. I wouldn't say it should be avoided like the plague, but since many others would, you might want to do so, I just don't know."

I was highly upset to see this movie with such low ratings. This is one of my favorite comedies. It's one of those movies you have to watch twice to see its full potential. I've seen this more than I've seen the original and Jim Carry is one of my all time favorite actors. They chose the perfect cast. Its was awesome watching the making of this movie. They decided to keep everyone who tried out for the main casting and did their best to give them a part.\n\nDont watch with high expectations and you wont be disappointed."

Well it's the same writers so that must mean something\n\n-and I think Richardson and Olsen were brave to step in to such legendary shoes - but you'll never please everybody, I s'pose."

It seems more like a gross-out teen comedy than a buddy comedy.\n\nEven some hardcore fans of Dumb and Dumber will probably not like this. The plot is stupid, and there aren't enough funny parts to save it. I do give those two guys credit for doing such a good job in filling Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels' shoes, though.

I admire the entire good mood of this film. I felt great after viewing it. I also haven't laughed that hard in an unnamed amount of time. Don't believe the criticism --- the only reason I can think of for those types of comments is that the lead roles aren't played by the same actors.

        "review_detailed_main": "Dumb and Dumber truly is a comedy classic. And getting it on DVD at Walmart a bunch of years ago is how I was introduced to this prequel, Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd, since it was a double feature. Now, as everybody knows, whereas the original continues to get immense praise to this day for the Farrelly Brothers' clever writing, and especially Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels' off-the-charts comic chemistry, this prequel, which, unlike the sequel that I already reviewed, involved none of those men, was panned by critics and audiences alike upon release, and is mostly forgotten (to the point that the sequel openly ignored it and showed that the Farrelly Brothers had their OWN ideas about Harry and Lloyd's past). Honestly, I myself have never been really fond of the prequel, to the point that I do not watch it as frequently as the original. And after watching it with a friend who came over just tonight, I understood why very few people like it; this movie only had me laughing sporadically.\n\nSet in 1986, 7 years before the events of the original movie, after being homeschooled all his life, 17-year-old dim-bulb Harry Dunne (played by Derek Richardson) is encouraged by his mom (Mimi Rogers) to attend public school, where he meets Lloyd Christmas (Eric Christian Olsen), who's exactly his age, and just as stupid to boot. On their first day of school, the duo are promptly roped into a phony \"special needs\" class set up by Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) with the help of his personal lover and cohort, school lunch lady Ms. Heller (Cheri Oteri), in a scheme to embezzle enough of the school's money to fund their new Waikiki condo (having already stolen a lot of the school's money using several other methods). Fellow student and school newspaper journalist Jessica (Rachel Nichols) soon catches wind of this corruption, and turns to Harry and Lloyd for help in her efforts to prove Collins and Ms. Heller's guilt.\n\nYou see, given this is a prequel, you should definitely expect re-used jokes and lines. But here's the problem: this entire prequel is basically a mix of jokes geared mostly toward grade-school age boys and overabundant nods to the original. To name a few: the scene of Harry's melted chocolate incident in Jessica's bathroom is a nod to the famous scene of him brutally pinching a loaf in Mary's toilet after Lloyd pranked him with laxative, the scene of Harry and Lloyd drinking slushies, leading to Harry getting brain freeze, is a twist on Harry and Lloyd burning their mouths when trying hot peppers, and the sexy twin girls in the convertible that Harry and Lloyd meet at the very end are a nod to the bikini models on the bus. Oh, and one of them is actually Fraida Felcher. Are you kidding me? When Fraida was mentioned in the first movie, Harry had no idea that Lloyd already knew who she was, so it would make zero sense for them to have both met her at the same time. It may just be that since Harry's dumb, he forgot, but I don't know.\n\nThis movie also gets several other things wrong from the original; one particularly egregious oversight is that in this movie, Harry seems to be the dumber one, having an imaginary friend and been held back at least 3 times during homeschooling, whereas Lloyd is the dumb one, acting as his mentor and guide to everyday life. This clashes with the original, where at the very beginning, the only dumb thing Harry did was get some dogs dirty on the way to a show through a combo of reckless driving and feeding them messy food, while Lloyd did a much larger amount of dumb things, not to mention much later in the movie, Harry had to help Lloyd read a simple sentence. It kind of makes me question whether Robert Brener (whoever he is), who came up with the story idea this movie is based on and co-wrote the script with director Troy Miller, and has never written another movie before or since, actually watched the original. In fact, as a YouTuber pointed out, he's likely directly related to New Line Cinema executive Richard Brener, and was hired to crap out a story outline and script for that reason alone. Hollywood nepotism right there.\n\nThen, we've got the music. Eban Schletter, one of the guys behind the music on SpongeBob SquarePants, scored this movie. And honestly, outside of the grand, sweeping cue when Harry and Lloyd meet, it doesn't do much beyond underscore the onscreen action. In regards to the songs, many of them fit, but I do have one complaint: why, during the opening, do we have Lloyd dancing to Vanilla Ice's \"Ice Ice Baby\" being played diegetically over the school PA? That song did not even exist until 1991; 5 years after this movie's events!!\n\nNow, let me get into some of the things that I did like about this movie: there were definitely a few scenes that did crack me up. In particular, the montage of Harry and Lloyd recruiting students for the special needs class had some really funny parts. I also loved any scene with the disgruntled gas station guy. But the funniest scene in the movie was Jessica's dad's profanity-infused rant when he thought Harry had defecated all over his bathroom (\"HE S**T EVERYWHERE!!!!!\").\n\nAnd one other thing: the cast. This prequel is rounded out by several terrific actors. Derek Richardson and Eric Christian Olsen were, in my opinion, perfectly cast as Harry and Lloyd. In terms of both their mannerisms and their appearances, they definitely feel like high school versions of Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey's portrayals. In addition, Eugene Levy is clearly doing his best as Collins. Cheri Oteri is fine as Ms. Heller. Rachel Nichols is good as Jessica. And even though he has only two scenes, Bob Saget (may he rest in peace) makes the most of his role as Jessica's dad. *sigh* I just wish the cast was given quality material to work with. No matter how well an actor plays their role, it'll always be constrained by how poorly written their character is, or how bad the script in general is, and this prequel is no exception. In particular, Shia LeBouf (who I remember as Stanley from Holes) was terribly underused in this movie, as special needs student Lewis, the school mascot, who Harry and Lloyd recruit after mistaking him for a centaur. That being said, his reaction when the tiny special needs bus jumps a hill (\"HEEEEEELLLLP MEEEEEE!!!!!!\") was priceless.\n\nBut everything considered, Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd really is nothing more than a lame prequel. People love to throw the term \"cash-grab\" around too much, but unfortunately, that's exactly what this movie is: a very brazen cash-grab, meant to profit off the original's success. In fact, it feels like New Line Cinema didn't understand its audience at all. Whereas the original Dumb and Dumber is a deliberately stupid comedy for smart people, this prequel is JUST stupid. Despite a great cast and a few good gags here and there, this prequel has nothing else to salvage. All the same, I find myself revisiting it (quite rarely) for those alone, mostly because it's tacked on my DVD with the original, which I've had for many years, and the few good laughs it has to offer hold my attention before I get bored. Even so, you may wanna stick with the original."

I have never laughed as hard since the original came out in 1994. I think I was even on the floor of the theater laughing during the snowman scene.\n\nSadly, this sequel has nothing that will make you more than slightly chuckle. Please don't waste your $ on this one at the theater. If you must see it, wait until it comes out on cable next year.\n\n1 of 5 stars\n\nSo sayeth the Hound."

But I still had high hopes for this movie! Jim Carrey is my idol and I was a little mad that he wasn't coming back, but you gotta understand, this dude wants to explore different characters. Anywayz, I went into this movie with my brother and we laughed out loud. Yeah there were some not so funny scenes, but it was still hilarious! Especially Bob Sagat! Eric Christian Olsen play Lloyd Christmas very well, but Derek Richardson is alright. I didn't think Eugene Levy gave his best, but Cheri was very funny! And that Rachel Nichols lady is mighty fine! Anywayz, all in all, this movie made me laugh, I wasn't disappointed, and I'm going to buy it when it comes out on DVD! I do have a life, but I can't put a movie down that easily (like Dreamcatcher), but this movie I didn't feel sorry for! But, yes, this movie could've done better with the Farrelly Brothers! I hope they get the thought to making a sequel and bring back Jim, Jeff, and Sebass! Although Dumb and Dumberer is funny stuff my man! 4 stars out of 4 stars\n\nSincerely Sidekick Jolly!"

Oops enough nostalgia.\n\nThe positive of this movie is that the make up was great. Harry and Loyd looked exactly like Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. I saw the actors in an interview without the makeup, and they are completely different looking. It was quite a transformation. Unfortunately this movie was just plain boring and not very humorous. One of the few funny scenes is when Harry pulls out a melted Hershey bar from his pants, and tries to get the chocolate off by rubbing it on the walls of the bathroom. Jessica's dad played by Bob Saget cannot believe that he rubbed excrement all over his walls, and starts freaking out. 6/10"

A sequel to a comedy classic that had a new director, new writers, and new forgettable nobody actors playing the leads. Lloyd is played by Eric Christian Olsen, who is most remembered for his role in Not Another Teen Movie and as a regular on NCIS: Los Angeles. Olsen does a fine job imitating Jim Carrey's Lloyd Christmas from the original, but the writing doomed this movie. Derek Richardson plays Harry Dunne, Richardson is most remembered for his role in Eli Roth's film Hostel just a few years later.\n\nThe comedy in this film is extremely underwhelming, I didn't laugh once. Even the best jokes this movie has are only slightly amusing, you may crack a smile but nothing more. Eugene Levy and Bob Saget are the saving grace that keeps the movie out of 1 star territory for me. Both actors are trying their best and are easily the funniest parts of the movie.\n\nIt's truly incredible that the original film has aged as well as it has. All the jokes that landed in 1994 still land three decades later. The same cannot be said about the follow up, which has aged like a raisin in the Nevada sun. Whether it be having the Asian foreign exchange student referred to as Ching Chong. Or the many jokes about special needs students, or a gay slur being used repeatedly by the protagonists. These cringeworthy missteps just shows the difference that quality script writing and directing can make."

And okay, it was some crappy movie the studios were trying to cash in on BUT, it most definitely did NOT suck. In fact, it rocked!\n\nIf you want to see this movie because you loved the first one, you probably will hate it. You'll probably say it lost all the appealing features of the first one and just kept the dirty \"potty humour\". And I won't argue with you. But, if like me, you can look at this film, not as a prequel to a great movie, but as just a movie, you should find it has a certain charm.\n\nEric Christian Olsen made a complete transformation for this movie (its hard to believe, but he's the \"cocky blonde guy\" from Not Another Teen Movie\"). He did as good a job, if not better, than Jim Carrey could have done himself. It's a worthwhile movie, just to see ECO play this character so well.\n\nAnd then there's Bob Saget. Everyone knows him as the dad in almost every cute kids TV show, so to hear him swear like that...well that's worth the price of rental at least!\n\nAnyway, this movie isn't going to make you think, or do anything more than make you glad you have a better IQ that Harry and Lloyd, but it is one of those movies that is so funny and simple that I, at least, want to watch it over and over again. Give it a chance, keep an open mind, forget about the original. It might not be a good \"prequel\", but it is a great movie. In my humble opinion, at least. :-)"

The movie is good most of the time but like in the first movie they are pretty stupid in this movie they are the biggest pair of Retards ever and are beyond stupid. Overall this movie is good but nothing great. You should definitely watch this movie if you have nothing better to watch but should probably just watch Dumb and Dumber again and if you have not already seen Dumb and Dumber see it now.

I will admit. I did laugh at a few parts in the movie. For example, best part - Bob Saget swearing at the top of his lungs. However, just as most of us thought, this movie was a pitiful attempt to try and recount the hilarious movie of 1994. No Farrelly Brothers, no Jim Carrey, no Jeff Daniels! You know it's going to be a flop. One of the best parts of the first movie was the quality songs that went along with the plot (i.e. \"The Flower Girl\", \"Boom Shack-a-lak\", \"Oh Pretty Woman\", etc.). This movie was void of a good soundtrack. Save your $8.25 and wait until this comes out on video.

        "review_detailed_main": "What on earth was I thinking when I willingly purchased a ticket for this abysmal attempt at a prequel? I know that prequels/sequels generally never live up to the expectations of the original, but I feel I must applaud Troy Miller on setting a new benchmark that sequels must stay well clear of.\n\nThe movie starts off by showing us a little bit of Harry's (Derek Richardson) childhood and a 'hilarious' experience with his imaginary friend. And take it from me folks, it gets worse. What follows is 90 minutes of pure cinematic dung. From the distasteful (a scene in which Harry appears to smear faeces on a bathroom wall) to the downright confusing (a not so funny `your it' sequence in a convenience store).\n\nMy view after watching the 1994 original was that Lloyd and Harry were just two buddies that were caught up a world that was just moving too fast for them. However, in this movie, Miller puts them across as being mentally disabled and so incompetent that they may not even develop into the people they are in the 1994.\n\nThe film takes every single hilarious scene from the original and milks it relentlessly, so much so that you may find yourself cringing when a line from the first is said. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the original, it is one of my favourite comedies but this shoddy knock-off has the ability to discourage a person from watching the original.\n\nThe cast list looks attractive on paper. Eugene Levy, Luis Guzman, Mimi Rogers and Cheri Oteri have all starred in fine comedies over the past few years but this movie is one I think that would be better left off the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Eric-Christian Olsen on the other hand may be one of the lucky ones, and this may actually benefit his career. His perfect take-off of Jim Carrey is flawless in both mannerisms and accent. He even managed to get a chuckle out of me in a scene involving him using a floor buffer on a sidewalk.\n\nAll in all, this movie is a complete waste of time and money for the cinema patron. If you want a laugh, rent the original. Its jokes are still as funny as they were in 1994, however, I can't see us looking back in 2012 in reminisce this movie.\n\n1 out of 10"

Also, the movie used the same jokes as in the first one only they weren't as funny the second time (especially since I've seen the first one about a hundred times). All in all, this movie was nowhere near as funny as the original and I was thoroughly disappointed."

No fun, just poop jokes - and although Harry's toilet visit in the original film was hilarious, thier attempt to copy it is disasterous..\n\nNo madder if you like the first film or not; do not waste your time with this garbage, that's just free advice!!!"

It wasn't only the subtle humor in the first film, but also the scenic locations they used. From RI to Aspen, we were along for the trip, amused with each scene building upon the last. But, what humor can be found from this film? What story-line are we exposed to? The answer is none. I was particularly impressed with the portrayal of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels that these two new actors gave, but this was the only impressive part of the film. I know I cannot expect a \"high-class\" comedy with a film like this, but none of the jokes worked in this film. None of the blatant puns or overused \"one-liners\" even remotely gave the impact of the first film. Although, I will concede that the scene with Bob Saget and the Hersey's Bar was enough to crack a smile, but this still does not justify spending 8 bucks. This felt more like watching a film written by and staring Rob Schneider. Dirp. 1/10"

After about 5 minutes, no one was responding at all to my little outbursts, so I just stopped and watched the movie. After twenty minutes of the movie, I was so annoyed and bored with the movie that I walked out.\n\nThis movie is the first movie I have ever walked out of. I'm quite the masochistic movie-watcher. I'll watch anything. This movie couldn't even maintain *my* interest. I laughed at the one scene where Lloyd wrote a message for his father in gigantic ketchup letters, but it wasn't a sustained laugh, and it was the only real one.\n\n1/10, definitely.

Never in my entire life have I been so bored and unentertained that in those 82 minutes. The movie is pointless! A crooked high school principal tries starting up a phony special needs class so he can receive a $100,000 grant from the school board, so he and his girlfriend (the school lunchlady) can run off together to Waikiki. I really do feel bad though for Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson who looked and acted EXACTLY like their famous counterparts, but were shorted with a cheap script, no jokes, and even worse, predictablity and THE SAME LINES from the original movie. I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 on the imdb scale, which is GENEROUS considering there are no 0's on there. This was by far the worst sequel and arguably the worst movie of all time. America and the World, if you see this movie, you can't be any dumberer."

The jokes were shallow, predictable, and weren't even funny. Not even Eugene Levy or Shia LaBeouf were laugh-worthy. Sadly enough, only Bob Saget should get any credit for laughs here. However, \"Harry\" and \"Lloyd\" actually captured their older counterparts quite well.\n\nAnother major problem I had with this movie was the anachronisms. No matter how stupid or amateurish the movie may be, if it's supposed to be 1986, at least put in some other than dressing everyone up like it's a bad 80s dance party.\n\nIn short, don't even bother seeing this movie unless you really enjoyed the first one, or you're too young to drive yourself there and you plan to entertain yourself by farting the entire night and kicking the back of everyone's seat in front of you, because that's what the 3 incredibly immature kids behind me did, which made the movie even worse."

I came to this movie with no expectations or preconceived notions about anything or anyone. If they made this movie any better it would simply have been different, not better. Highly recommended.

It wasn't as long as Dumb & Dumber, but that can be overlooked, especially knowing that comedy movies are all spanned around 75-90 minutes with about 30 exceptions every year.\n\nI can't understand why everyone hates this so much. Is it because Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels weren't in it? If that's so, then let me ask you this. Since they've aged 9 years since Dumb & Dumber, do you really think they'd be perfect teenagers? Jim Carrey reached his 40th birthday in 2002! Overall, Dumb & Dumberer was 85 minutes of pure fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw the trailer for this, and was quite excited. A few of my friends were not interested in seeing the film, as they stupidly believed that it is not possible to make a good second installment to a film without any of the original cast or crew. So i dragged my brother to see it. Within moments we were in tears of laughter.\n\nFrom the word go the film hits you with some of the silliest jokes you could imagine, and they work. From Lloyd thinking Harry's mum is the tooth fairy, to discovering that Lloyd's dad is in fact a latino school janitor (wonderfully played by the very charismatic Luis Guzman). Granted, most of the characters in the film are quite dumb, but that is what makes the film work. If, like in the 1st film, everyone except Harry and Lloyd were smart, the comedy would not work. You begin to understand why Harry and Lloyd are so incrediblly stupid. I also believe that if everything was the same as the 1st film, then people would just be saying \"it is the same movie, nothing new\".\n\nTroy Miller has definately proved that he can make a good comedy. He is on par with the Zuker brothers and Jim Abrahams. I would love to see a Troy Miller movie starring Will Farrell, Chris Kattan, and Leslie Neilson. With cameos by Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Rbin Williams. Obviously, by looking at my choice of comedians, you will begin to understand my sense of humour. So if you do not find these guys funny, then i recommend you give this film a miss. Stick to the more 'straight comedies' such as Legally Blonde (ZZZZZZZ!!).\n\nDerek Richardson has manged to mimic Jeff Daniels perfectly. It is very believeable to think he is a younger Daniels. Eric Christian Olsen brings something of his own to Lloyd. The voice is similar, but Olsen has obviously realised that mimicing Carrey will get him slated by critics and audiences, so Lloyd belongs to Olsen in this film.\n\nI loved this film. On DVD release, it will definately find it's way into my collection.\n\nI give it 4 out of 5."

It is sweet, the 2 leads are likeable and funny, and it has one of the most laugh-out-loud 2-hit jokes of my 35 years as a film fan. I'm 40. The cast is great, if you're actually a film fan who's like a walking iMDB for actors, some still visible, some not. It's better than Dumb and Dumber To, overall. Eric Christian Olsen as Lloyd is hiwawious. Watch it, and ffs grow up. Not every film has to be Scorsese. It's funny, has Stifler's Dad (Eugene Levy) as a villain, has Bob Sagat screaming, twice, a total babe as a supporting character (Rachel Nicholls)... I could go on. Don't listen to the haters."

For me, the original had a special place in my childhood, I've seen in many times since, and I still consider it to be the Farrelly Brothers' best work to date. Now here is a prequel (the execs probably thought, hey Lucas can do it, how hard can it be) and I think that, if anything else, it is an extremely pale reread/imitation of the original material. I'm not saying the movie is entirely laughless, in fact there were a few moments when I had a chuckle or two or some grins at the reckless ingenuity of the characters' stupidity (there's even one laugh out loud moment inside the \"Special-Needs\" classroom involving a quiet jock when he gets riled up by the other students). The problem lies in that any of the \"original\" jokes or gags have been done in so many other movies it can only be amusing after a while to the most slight of minds...which means that it will at least earn back a little of the money it took to make it. In other words, Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd is precisely for it's target group, and it doesn't aim for anything more or audacious like the original, and there's only a minor curiosity to see these two knuckleheads portray younger versions of Carrey and Lloyd. I didn't hate it, but when I left I wanted at least half of a refund. c-."

This movie was FUNNY, REALLY FUNNY, way better than i expected. There are at LEAST 10 or more laugh out loud moments. All I can say is that most people must have been in bad moods when they saw this movie, (or was I in a really good mood) or they just wanted to see jeff danials and jim carry again. No friken way this movie is one of the worst movies EVER. This comment is mostly for anyone who can vote on this site to tell them to get this movie off the bottom 100. Anyone who wants to see this movie but have heard bad things about it, give it a chance."
