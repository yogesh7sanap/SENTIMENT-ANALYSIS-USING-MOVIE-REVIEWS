Directing...Olivier Megaton is actually a good director, but here he didn't pay too much attention in the editing or directing. Scenes are scattered and disconnected, with random parallel stories which do not deliver anything extra to the film. They just tire the viewer. The violence... is only used to provide \"action\" to the slow-burn and dull storyline. The story itself... the idea is not bad, the delivery and the stretch of the idea to make it a 2,5 hour long movie; yes that's very bad. Acting...here it is actually 50/50. Some moments are rewarding but not enough to save this film. Overall, I m rather upset that someone spent all this money to create such a time-consuming, violent and pointless movie. 2/10 , don't waste your time."

It reminds me of films like Shoot 'Em Up, Crank, Death Race, and Children of Men. It is great to see studios putting effort and budget into adapting non family friendly graphic novels.\n\nPeople really need to realize that giving such harsh reviews unnecessarily to films adapted from graphic novels will only discourage studios from adapting more comic books/graphic novels into film.\n\nAside from a few slow moments in the film it is actually a decent crime action film that's well shot, well acted, and you can tell they took it seriously. Also Michael Pitt was great in this film and feel he was the stand out actor in his role.\n\nI've read a lot of negative reviews based on police brutality and riots being in the film which is the dumbest excuse to give a film negative reviews. So you're telling me that the people who started making this film years ago were trying to make a film that was what, mocking our current state of the country?! Good movie, don't over think things and just enjoy a cheasy action movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Netflix has blessed (or \"blessed\") us with yet another crime blockbuster, this time one directed by Olivier Megaton (\"Transporter 3\", \"Taken 2\", \"Colombiana\"), who's no stranger to action movies. The critical acclaim has never been real high for him, and, sadly, \"The Last Days of American Crime\" is within the same ballpark as all his movies before. Personally, this is my least favorite chapter in his filmography.\n\nIn a not-too-distant future, as they put it, U.S. government is a week away from activating a signal that will make it impossible for people to go against the law, any and all law. It will do so via brain rape, just try lifting a gun or shoplifting a snickers and you'll freeze and shake uncontrollably. You probably can hear the sarcasm and irony already, so yes, I did not enjoy this movie a lot. Besides that particular interesting and far-fetched idea, it's a highly conventional and thoroughly mildly frustrating crime flick romp, featuring plot and characters based off ancient blueprints. Some characters are no more than a mere sketch, like the one given to the guy I was excited to see the most, Sharlto Copley. His storyline went down the mill and down the hill. First half an hour is mostly pure and simple exposition, and the action doesn't even change gears until 70 minutes into already. There's all the usual romance and subplots, all of which end up just about where You expect them. The melodrama at play here really ticks all the most typical and overused boxes. Movie's real enemy, though, is its runtime. It is way too long for its own good, way too long and featuring way too little, clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes & that's not counting titles. A story of this depth and this quality usually deserves maybe a 100 minutes, maybe, and even then it still is what it is. At the very least, I was expecting a good heist factor. Everything leads up to it, only for me to understand that it's the wackiest, most unexciting heist movie ever. Frankly, the heist plot and even the crime-stopping-signal plot matter very little in the big picture of \"The Last Days of American Crime\". They say the graphic novel this movie's based on, is great and all. I don't know about that, but the adaptation certainly isn't great.\n\nThe Positives? Acting. No award material on the horizon, but decent portrayals of dry characters, with the highlight probably being Anna Brewster and Michael Pitt, though Pitt's character is not easy to like. Next positive would be big budget. Movie looks arguably good, though still, by all means, it's undoubtedly an uninspired blockbuster. Crisp, contrastive cinematography, sometimes overkilled in editing, we also got explosions, raging guns, crashes and whatnot. The typical drivel, it just happens to be well made here. And original score, soundtrack - also decent. For a big part, the movie is pretty macho, many male characters are like that, boys, and if there's one truth in this world, it's that boys will be boys. The original score, being rocky and bluesy, went hand in hand with that. As for the soundtrack, it reminded of \"Sucide Squad\", because it had good songs, but no good reason to use them whatsoever. \"The Last Days of American Crime\" ended with Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\" - kind of a waste on a two-bit clich\u00e9 ending like this one.\n\nIt's a movie of no originality, but it's not exactly bad at being a well made conventional crime thriller, I mean as conventional as it gets, despite its sci-fi-ish backdrop. It shoots itself in all the rest proverbial knees by making itself a 2 and a half hour experience, major mistake there. Regardless of the runtime, but even more because of it, I don't recommend watching this brick of a movie. My rating: 5/10."

The action sequences are convincing and fun (sometimes funny) with a great character build by michael pitt (natural born killers meets taxi driver) and a decent performance by ramirez when he does speak too much. The concept of the story is a bit far fetched but you learn to resonate with it as the world is unraveled. Car crashes alla michael bay-esque and a love tringle you're not sure what to make of complete the piece you probably watched already and are trying to convince yourself it wasnt that bad after all.

The big flaw is that it is clearly too long - it should have lost 30 minutes or more and sure, some scenes are pretty badly done. Yet on the whole I thought it was an okay watch. I admit I did not quite follow all the ins-and-outs of the heist, but that didn't really matter. Neither did the occasional plot holes or inconstancies. They obviously went for a very gritty, bloody action film and it certainly is that.\n\nI was expecting the idea of the 'API', a transmission that affects the mind to prevent law-breaking to just be a McGuffin, but it turned out much more interesting than that. There are shades of 'Clockwork Orange' in some of the ramifications. And there's plenty in this film about the power and motivations of government agencies, which have a lot of resonance right now. I would also mention the excellent acting performance of Anna Brewster bringing more complexity to the girlfriend role than you' expect."

Completely unecessary considering the scenes that do drag are unimportant to the storyline. The characters don't bond and the antagonist Brick shows no sign of proving to us that he is worth any consideration.\n\nReal shame as the concept could have been actually good if they'd used the two and half hours more appropriately instead of wasting our time with pointless and uninteresting scenes."

        "review_title": "Much better than the score and reviews giving it a \"1\" would have you believe",
        "review_detailed_main": "This film to me proves probably more than any other that you can't trust most IMDB reviews or score for Netflix titles. For some reason, a lot of people just have it out for them, I think. That's the only way I can think to explain such a rash of incredibly low scores and dismissive, useless non-reviews. You've got a ton of people just saying this is \"boring\", with no qualification, one person even saying it looks like something Tommy Wiseau would make. Seriously? Such gross hyperbole. It's really infantile.\n\nNow I'm not saying this is a masterpiece or anything. The writing has some issues. The narration (which is most just at very beginning and somewhat quickly disappears) is pretty bad, and had me thinking of the narration in Southland Tales (not a good point of comparison for any film). The protagonist is not particularly well developed, I feel. It would be one thing if he were either portrayed as being sympathetic or more of an anti-hero, but we're not really given enough of either to make him seem compelling. He's just a little flat, and I'm not sure whether to attribute it to Ramirez' performance or just the way the character is written. That said, I thought some of the other characters were entertaining, particularly Kevin (Michael Pitt), who kind of stole all the scenes he was in.\n\nThe biggest complaint I've seen of the film (although, again, few seem to actually want to talk about it like a grown-up) is that it's \"boring.\" The film is a bit long (around 2.5 hours), and yes, it is a lot of set-up for the payoff. But that isn't to say nothing happens during the set-up. There are several sub-plots that are important, and I think anyone just dismissing the film as \"boring\" is probably saying more about their lack of attention span than the film itself. If you're looking for a simple straight-up crime caper, this is probably not the film for you. This film has an interesting premise and some good world-building that necessarily takes a little time to establish. As iffy as the writing sometimes is (especially the dialog), overall this really is a somewhat involved story, which is one of the film's best aspects.\n\nCriticism that the film is poorly made (see above comment re: Wiseau) is amusing at best. Again, while I wouldn't say this is masterfully directed, it's at the very least competent. The action is usually compelling, and there are a lot of scenes that have a good build-up of suspense. I never felt like I was watching something amateurish. This more than anything kind of makes me wonder what the agenda is of the massive amount of people saying such things about the film. What is their point of comparison? It seems more likely that there is some reason external to the film for them to be targeting it. But that's all conjecture, and ultimately irrelevant. All I can is that I strongly disagree and urge people to give this a shot and decide for themselves. Don't be dissuaded by the nay-sayers and the ridiculously low score (currently 3.6, which is laughable). I'd say this is easily in the 5-7 range, probably somewhere in the middle. I'm tempted to give it an 8 or higher just to offset some of the obvious troll votes, but I am going to give it a 7 which is the high end of what I think is reasonable and accurate to my experience."

Maybe it was the 0 rotten score or 3.6 rating that made me have such a low expectation, but I was entertained.\n\nI will say a lot of what people say is pretty accurate. The acting wasn't awful, but it wasn't always good. The story was a bit all over the place and some characters that you thought would have a bigger impact, didn't. The chemistry between actors were poor with only glimpses of what could have been. The movie also takes itself too serious. A little more tongue and cheek type of fun would have made some of this easier to watch.\n\nFor what I thought was good, the action was alright. It reminded me of action from the 80's. A lot of people holding guns that can't aim, but still thought it was fun. It's kind of the same with the car chases and explosions, all over the top fun. Finally, I hated the villains in the movie, hated them. Why is this good? Because that means I couldn't wait to see them pay for being so annoying. Not saying they do, just saying they made me annoyed enough to make me mad. I always give credit to actors who bring out real emotion, and the real villains of the movie did that.\n\nAll in all, its a wasted opportunity. I love the template of the story. Unfortunately, it wasn't executed well. I think the 3.6 and zero rotten score is not fair, but than again its a matter of opinion. It personally caught my attention enough that I was curious what would happen at the end."

I am not famliar with the graphic novel this is based on, so I can't compare those things for you though.\n\nThe beginning kind of sets the mood. This is over the top. Still as over the top as that seems, there is a scene that is odd to say the least. Actually being shot close range, should be the end of the discussion. But it is not - this is something that may break the movie for you. It is quite ridiculous to say the least, but it is what it is. Technically the movie works, the actors do their best for the kind of schlock it is they are in. Overall this is more than decent - it may be a bit too long, but other than that: good set pieces, great action and stunts and a decent story to hold it all together"

Side stories with some potential are well introduced at first, then not developed, then getting intriguing, then suddenly torn into ashes. Time ticker is shown all the time like in \"24\" but the content seen on screen does not fit.\n\nAll in one, just too predictable, too conventional, too dull. The \"adult\" scenes cannot overplay it.

All the same here we go. Oh and I will not give anything away from the film.\n\nFirst off it starts well. It still has that element of comic book to it. So that's a good start. The cast is......... ok. Anna Brewster who plays Shelby Dupree for me did steel the film. Every scene she is in she showed that she could do much better things. The rest of the cast I am sorry to say just could not match up to her. Was that down to their acting or the writing of the film? Not too sure.\n\nThe story just did not flow that well. It kind of stop started a lot. I feel if more time was put in to it then it would have run better.\n\nSo I guess it comes down to why I gave it 8 out of 10. A big part has to go to Anna Brewster. I can not wait to see what she does next. Another part is when time was taken on action scenes it was done well. It is mostly the parts in between. Is it a possible cult film? No. It will not win any critics around as well. For me I sat down having read so many bad reviews and found it was not that bad! I will watch it again at some point but in the mean time it was interesting film. Well done Miss Brewster."

Direction...all over the place 4. Acting...main character when to Kristen Stewart/Kneau Reeves acting school...nuff said. 5.Ability to shoot...almost all action movies have terrible shooters, this one is one of the worst I've seen. Military/police trained and LITERALLY standing three feet away with automatic weapons and miss. 6. Security...almost all action movies have the bad security systems, this is one of the worst I've seen. My video doorbell was higher security then some scenes with billion dollar technology."

Another issue are the three main leads: ; none of whom resemble any of their original incarnations. Putting aside those of us who might know what it's based on, Edgar Ramirez just looks glazed in boredom; Michael Pitt chews up scenery as an OTT spoilt son-of-crimelord-with-daddy-issues & Anna Brewster's femme fatale is sadly lacking any real sexual charisma which is needed for the part. Oliver Megatons direction is also far from enticing, which given some of his mediocre previous Efforts like Taken 2 & 3 and Transporter is hardly surprising. To add to the various issues, Sharlto Copley pops up every now and again as a dumb cop who would appear to have some intrinsic part to play in all this, but even his involvement left me thinking why did they have him in it at all? The big heist finale is also botched with little build up in tension or excitement - a crime which seems fairly easy to carry out and unbelievably executed. I quite like some of Netflix movie production output, but they have more than their fair share of crap product and sadly this is one of the latter."

This move could have been better if an hour of talk was cut out. There were lots of speeches and conversations that were so silly the viewer laughed at the people made to say them. It is a European made movie about how bad violent America is in the future and Canada is the goal for all Americans to escape their life of crime. Some guys wanna steal money to make the trip.

The only bad thing is that it has two scenes that are not completely achieved and one of the characters after being shot after hours walking dancing as if nothing had happened."

The director must have slept thru the filming and the producer must have been absent aswell.. One can't help by wonder how films like this make it into production.. It should have been called \"That'll do\" because that's the general feeling this film gives off.. Like it was all made with a \"that'll do\" attitude. Netflix has lowered the bar on this one... The real crime is the running time... Maybe that's why the movie sucks so bad because everyone behind the cameras were asleep!\n\nIn short... You'll never be bored enough to enjoy this film. It's only good feature is edgar but even he can't save it. Definitely the worst film I've seen this year."

But the story does take a back seat with uninteresting characters. And a concept that plays like a sci fi thriller. With the idea taking place in the future. Where law enforcement are planning to use a signal to stop people from committing crimes. That is where Brick (Edgar Ramirez) comes in. When he discovers his brother is dead in prison. He plans to get revenge by one last crime by robbing a money vault. With the help from Kelvin (Michael Pitt) and Shelby (Anna Brewster).\n\nThe plot is boring. There is a twist with a character. The characters are forgettable and uninteresting. Brick is a guy who wants to get revenge for his brother. Kelvin is a want to be gangster who wants to commit a big crime to impress his father. And Shelby who is Kelvins love interest has her own personal agenda. While, officer William (Sharlto Copley) had a rough past as a cop. Sharlto Copley's character is very undeveloped.\n\nThe film does have a decent amount of action to make this entertaining or its flashy direction. The film is over long for its running time. The first half was entertaining. When the heist is happening. It all comes crashing down a little too fast. Which makes it hard to keep interest in the movie.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty bad movie. The acting is dull. The characters are boring. The story and concept is messy and tedious."

Everything is explained in this movie, irritatingly so when the plot itself is simplistic and can be summarised in the opening six minutes or so: America irredeemably bad - Canada unquestionably good. Government and order unquestionably bad - anarchy and disorder, revered and praised. It is an interesting concept certainly but is executed so poorly, so hamfistedly and so condescendingly of the audience that it is a painful, and laborious viewing. It attempts to be stylistic in periods, and is utterly soulless in doing so. The film lacks substance likewise. An interesting premise but that is all. Avoid."

This preceded a chase scene where it seems nobody has ever shot a gun before. I've never seen a fine film go so south so quickly before in my life and there was still like an hour and a half left at that point. Tragic."

(Don't ask it's not really explained.) Crime is rampant in the period leading up to the signal broadcast. bank robber Bricke (Edgar Ramirez) has messed up his chance to escape to Canada and his mob bosses have a hit out on him. He is approached by Kevin Cash (Michael Pitt) and Shelby Dupree (Anna Brewster), a consummate femme fatale, with a plan to pull off one last heist. A menage a trois develops as the film stumbles across sub-plots, unlikelihoods and non-sequiturs. Some really good fight scenes, shoot-outs and car-chases in the film but quite often they do not advance the narrative. Also gory and violent, some very disturbing scenes. There's a good film struggling to emerge from this morass but it would require a significant cut in the 149 minute running time. Directed by Olivier Megaton from a screenplay by Karl Gajdusek. 5/10. On Netflix"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie isn't even \"so bad, it's good\". Sometimes a movie is such a train wreck that watching it is an entertaining endurance challenge. This is not such a movie. I feel like this movie got a green light based on the title and a one page pitch...and then the writer ran out of ideas. A story about the last possible crimes before a neurological device stops the entire country from acting on criminal impulses is a GREAT premise! How did this device get distributed? Who stands to gain from the end of crime? Why does Michael Pitt's character have such a jacked up relationship with his family? If people are going to murder their immediate family, the audience needs to know WHY. There are so many questions that go unanswered in this movie. In fact, there is not ONE plot device that makes sense. There is not ONE storyline that satisfies. There is not ONE character worth caring about.\n\nI'm offended that this movie was even made, it has the production value of a decent budget, yet it seems to have been written and directed by unimaginative middle schoolers. Middle schoolers with a VERY RICH PARENT.\n\nIf you're old enough to remember Pia Zadora's \"Butterfly,\" this movie is worse than that! Butterfly was a vanity project starring the talentless Zadora and financed by her crazy-rich, super-old husband. It featured father/daughter incest Story treated with inexplicably romantic gauze-over-the-lens soft focus. Until this, it was the worst movie I've ever seen. I'd watch that tripe again to avoid seeing this again...\n\n..So I have a couple of questions for the producers of this film. 1) Where did the money come from? 2) HOW did you get the very talented Michael Pitt to sell his soul for this dreck? Is he deep in debt? Was he blackmailed? 3) Why is it that in an industry where so many super talented women and minority writers and directors are struggling to get a break, this Megaton hack is still able to get financing? Please let this be his last picture. In addition to some of the worst directing this side of \"Showgirls,\" this director had the audacity to clock this trash in at 2.5 hours! Grotesquely self indulgent.\n\nYeah, no. Don't see this movie. Not even for fun."

Even post production looks like it was poorly done, with jarring cuts from one scene to the next.\n\nHalf of the scenes are basically irrelevant to the movie.

The lead and his brother are two different nationalities and have different accents. It's like the movie didn't even try. Horrible exposition and narration. It's like all anyone watches is the news so we can get bits of information here and there. The movie is well over two hours for Christ's sake. Not sure if the science is truly ever explained or if we're just supposed to accept that the government has the capability to stop all crime. Very little character development.

I mean most of the Oscar's winning movies are really slow and loooong and people seem to enjoy it for some reason.. this one is more of an hybrid between the fast and the furious and that John wick movie.. right at the middle and end of the movie it gets faster if that's the issue.. if you think it's slow, just hang in there until the middle thing and it will get better.. some acting could be better and some plots could be better but it's definitely above average.."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on Rick Remender and Greg Tocchini's 2009 graphic novel of the same name, The Last Days of American Crime clocks in at a bottom numbing 148 minutes and will test your patience despite all the gory excesses that director Olivier Megaton and screenwriter Karl Gajdusek throw at the screen. The story focuses on career criminal Graham Bricke (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez) as he struggles to get back in the game since the death of his brother Rory (Daniel Fox) in a robbery. Seeking revenge against those responsible for his brother's loss he teams up with fellow criminals Kevin Cash (Michael Pitt) and Shelby Dupree (Anna Brewster) to plan a huge heist, racing against the clock before a mysterious government-made signal threatens to put a stop to all crime for good. The movie was panned by critics who took exception to its violent content and depictions of police brutality in light of the George Floyd protests (during one brutal fight scene a police officer is shown choking someone). Sure, it has it's flaws, but it isn't as bad as the reviews make it out to be, despite the fact it tries too hard to be something it's not, and leaves viewers wondering about the central message. Rather than attempt to deliver on its intriguing premise (an America without crime, but different to other movies like The Purge), The Last Days of American Crime wastes its potential by turning into an action flick with little intelligence behind it."

It's the movie playing in the movie \"The Last Action Hero\" that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nSo lame you Internet people wouldn't get this style of movie. It has such a low rating bc people think they are Siskal and Ebert. I just read Ebert's review and you are all writing exactly the same review. No, that doesn't mean you are \"right\". It means you have no opinion whatsoever. Same old stuff I hear from critics about all movies. Well, I grew up enjoying watching movies. It used to be fun to watch over exaggerated representations of people. Movies are junk, it's entertainment. Why did everyone start watching movies as a way to understand life? Movies do not represent REAL LIFE. Movies are fake. They are supposed to not make sense. It's for fun. The rules of physics don't exist. Also... you know why you can't enjoy this movie.... B/c you take everything so LITERAL! The movie is being IRONIC. Learn how to spot these two words I just capitalized. .....I have to type paragraphs out as if I were addressing babies bc you all keep dwelling on dumb \"quickly punched in words\" that nobody thinks twice about, that people leave as their comments (half assed thought out comments). You have a problem if you are sitting here, voluntarily, reading words that \"hurt\" you. Anyways, back to literal and ironic, I know these are two very common words you Internet people always use incorrectly. Learn their meaning and you'll finally \"really\" wake up you dungeon gopher in grand makeup disguises, brainwashed backwards minority, as in a SMALL percentage, words have more than one meaning based on how the person uses them in a sentence. So if you never listen, you will never get a clue. And hence, you believe fake news\ud83d\ude1b\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc97\n\nJust watch it and laugh.\n\nIt's like Face Off sorta. Like Those big 90's Nick Cage Action movies we all used to love."

It was obvious the director and writers were trying really hard to make a slick, stylized movie, but it all came off really flat. None of the characters were at all likable, and very little real insight was given into them or their backgrounds, so they just came off very flat. Very little of the movie was actually about the proposed crime/heist, which would have been fine if the rest of the movie was interesting. One thing which really bothered me is some of the bad accents. Actors seem to slip in and out of various European accents throughout the movie without any in-movie explanation as to why this would be happening. I can only assume it's the result of actors from other countries doing their best american accents part of the time, and giving up at other times."

Maybe Netflix should create a X2 play speed if they are going to continue to purchase these types of films. I lasted 44 mins before I had to start scrolling, watched a few more scenes and the ending. Not much of an effort. The low budget created lot of problems, from the police stations with 6 cops in them to the border crossing with 4 officers and highways without cars.

It's not over the top and cartoonish, but never really quite gets there, but it's enough to be interesting.\n\nRamirez was SO bad it just crushed the movie. The script was pretty so so. Just a revamp of typical action movie with a nostalgic Escape from NY flavor. Most of the supporting actors/actresses were pretty good. Brewster in particular. She almost made a really horribly written role shine. If you believed anything in the movie it was her. The premise is kind of goofy, the plot is also, but not so over the top as to be inane like so many action movies are today. Ramirez was just so wooden with his lines. It was like they cast a voice mail prompt for the lead role. Overdub his lines and this would have been a fun waste of an hour or so. A chance to revisit the 80s crime dystopia movies. They really need to overdub Ramirez's lines and re-release this movie."

The character development one dimensionally runs in a lack of depth. Then, the performances seemed uninspired and wooden from the performers. Social commentary in the movie is quite heavy-handed and scattered, while the violence and other explicit content seem absolutely gratuitous.

When it takes effect, police will cease its operations and instead some guy in DC will monitor things. There are protests everywhere and people are fleeing or trying to flee to Canada.\n\nSome guy named Bricke takes his time to set some other guy on fire. There's some talk about Bricke's brother who was in jail and died there. Then he hooks up with a pretty girl in bar. Turns out pretty girl is Cash's girl. It's Cash who now approached Bricke with a proposal after telling him the the truth about how his brother died in jail. The idea is to rob billions from the local Federal Reserve just as API launches. Of course they will have to hack into it to give them a couple of minutes to escape. So we spend some days with these goofs as they live their ugly and violent lives. Cash is the estranged son of a mob family. They need some explosives from dad. So they visit him and some pointless violence ensues to get their hands on the explosives.\n\nBricke brings in some sidekick of his as health insurance. Pretty girl has a deal with the FBI because she has a sister and the FBI is taking her to Canada before API. Bricke has some more violent run-ins with the guy he set on fire in the intro and with the mob captains.\n\nAt last, half an hour before the movie is over, the heist begins. Things go nearly as planned but with plenty of bloody violence in between. Of course there is unnecessary and unlikely romance between pretty girl and Bricke.\n\nSo unfortunately, this movie is as bad as the rating here suggests. The concept is good, there are some ideas and good lines here and there, but it just doesn't work. The movie is too long, too ugly, too unnecessarily violent--and I'm not one to shy away from violent movies, but this is the definition of gratuitous violence. They try to give us some pointless background about a cop who will later confront pretty girl. Among all these nasty characters, who do you root for? No one. Pretty girl is a secondary character but you do end up rooting for her for a lack of a good lead character. Bricke doesn't say much of anything throughout the movie so who cares about him. Cash is more likeable but the over the top acting doesn't help. This movie then stumbles and drags aimlessly along for two hours instead of giving us some cool heist planning. The heist itself is of course alright, not even Megaton! Can botch a heist entirely. But there's no way around that Megaton! Can't direct his way out of a paperbag, at least not without Brisson holding his hand. Here they gave him the budget, the cast, the ideas and he still can't deliver. I assume the script isn't too bad because Gajdusek is fairly competent. The editor, a Megaton! Associate, on the other hand isn't. Had they trimmed this thing by an hour and toned down the silliness and the ugliness they could have had a good sci-fi action flick. Three stars for Anna Brewster, the lovely nudity, and some smart ideas."

Nor characters (other than they are all bad people). Nor the directing or effects. It's a problem with Editing. The editor forgot to edit. There is nothing on the editing room floor.

Michael Penn's acting was amazing as always but it was just too crazy of a movie to warrant the same amount of time as Godfather or Star Wars.\n\nNow, mad aside, the movie production was ok. It had a solid plot, production wasn't cheap and a story you could get behind. A rating of 3.7 (average at the time of this writing) is a little harsh. I can't help to believe if Bruce Willis or some other A list played the lead, it might be averaging 5 or 6. Still, I don't feel like I enjoyed this and would've liked to have my 2.5 hours back."

It's filled with bad guys that you absolutely LOVE to HATE. Nobody gets out unscathed in some fashion or another. The fast pace distracts from the two and a half hour running time. The very best of this film, in my opinion, was the acting of Michael Carmen Pitt. He did a superb job as the demented son of a huge crime boss who is trying to make his own legacy. His portrayal reminded me of Jeffery Goines in \"12 Monkeys\". Totally on edge. Totally unpredictable. Totally nuts! See it for yourself. Critics screw up too!"

We have a dark dystopic crime ridden city in a country going to h__l because of crime so that gets one star. We have numerous bad guys trying to score one final heist before some Plot Magic is going to make crime except by the state impossible--Maybe. Then we introduce the femme fatale who just does not work for the story line and those doing her beck and call should know better. In the end there is a sunset, but who rides off into it is unrewarding. There are reviews galore giving this 1 & 2 and over 6 scores. Do not trust them. There is a long but kinda complete movie here. Minimal action and characters that behave, but sadly do not develop. I am putting this as a 3 stars as it just keeps going and going absent rewards to the reviewer. I can understand people like the setting and dystopia giving it one of two more stars. But, there was so much opportunity here to have a good movie and sadly it never made it to the final presentation. If you miss this one, you are not going to regret it much as there are few memorable moments or lines. Netflix is going to have to step up their game if this represents what they call dark dystopian Science Fiction. In many ways they would have had a better movie to kill everybody off at about the 80 minute mark as that would have been a better reward for my time."

The dialogue and interactions are stilted. This film helps weirdest romantic intro conversation that's laughably bad and unrealistic. It's actually funny\n\nThe acting is really bad across the board. Most are really trying but the direction and script doesn't help. Edgarr Ramirez either scowls or talks low. I swear I've seen this guy act well before.\n\nI struggled to get through more than a half an hour of this. Violence didn't help."

The acting goes straight down the toilet, and you will find yourself wincing at the screen wonder, \"What the actual hell is this?\"\n\nThe dialogue is some of the cheesiest crap you'll ever hear, and the acting is so forced and ridiculous. I struggle to think of a movie I've ever seen that was worse.\n\nThis clearly shows that Netflix doesn't even watch what they produce. Someone offered them a movie, they threw money at it, and then simply added it to their streaming service. They should be EMBARRASSED!!!"

It's based on a graphic novel. Lots of action, lots of big characters and lots of beautiful camera shots. It is just a beautiful film, if you can say this about a film where's so much violence and blood. Beautifully produced, beautifully acted, beautifully directed. A beautiful story? Well it is not the typical Hollywood ending, perhaps people have a problem with this? That they are so much conditioned by Hollywood rules of telling a story? It is about the last days where crime is possible in America. About people who make a living out of crime and who are trying to protect their livelihood before their possibilities get taken away by society. The title says it all really. No more story is needed. Perhaps it is men who are giving this film a low score because men aren't the real survivors in this film."

Although I'm sure some viewers may refer to it as music, one cannot settle into the film's rhythm due to the fact that every scene is polluted by dyspeptic songs or synth symphonic syrup or ominous metal-tech droning of sound which is usually annoying enough but here it's laid in over everything--it drowns out the sound effects and, what would be inconceivable to any screenwriter, dwarfs almost every single line of dialogue. It makes me wonder if this is how people under the age of 30 live their lives: music of all kinds playing in their ears as they live their lives, swirling over their disjointed conversations with other human beings. For a film of this type and theme, perhaps the director should have had one more listen to the soundtrack of 'Blade Runner' and learned how to use music artistically. This film had me wondering if the directer owed money to the composer or sound design department and just let them fill the movie with all this racket after he had a boring movie on his hands when he had yet to play in the music track. This dreadful habit seems to be used in countless films today which have music droning ALL THE TIME throughout their running times. One other example of this ridiculous practice takes place in the otherwise splendid 'Impeachment' series of American Crime Story -- remarkable performances by the cast members are almost ruined by this relentless insipid droning sound calamity: imagine having great dialogue (which that show has) constantly drowned out in dramatic scenes. Such goes on in this film as well. All scenes which could have had subtlety in the performance and dynamic mastery from the cast (screams, mumbles, whispers) are obliterated by this relentless sonic invasion of one's brain. Add to this the running time of almost two and one half hours and I felt, after a single hour, what Noriega must have felt after having his stronghold blasted by non-stop Britney Spears tunes until he finally surrendered. The violence in the picture (useful to the plot but not necessary on the scale it is used here) and the film's total lack of silence had me ready to commit a violent act myself. All we can hope, if this bad habit continues in films, is that an audio track is made available for viewers to opt for that does not contain any music at all. And then we can silently plead that filmmakers will actually learn how music can artistically enhance -- and not overpower -- the story they are trying to tell. I certainly hope they do learn the difference because if they do not, it will certainly make it much easier for me to make it through the list of new films offered to us each year; each movie will get only 30 minutes of my time until I've had enough of the infernal cacophony going on."

This means that it's not a great character study film if that is what you're into.\n\nThe reason this film was of any significance to me, however, was not the plot (which is sort of unique) but was the soundtrack, transforming this film from a dumb action movie with not enough action to a mystery thriller.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film hit Netflix today and I have had the chance to watch The Last Days Of American Crime and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a crew attempt to commit a heist just before a signal comes in to play to stop anybody from commiting a major crime.\n\nMain Character Edgar Ramirez plays the main character here and honestly I have never been a big fan of his, I just find him really boring to watch and this film is no different as he is such a boring lead character. There is nothing unique about him at all as a lead character and the film gives you no reason to care about him or why he is doing what he is doing so it leads you to become bored by him.\n\nSupporting Characters The great Sharlto Copley is in this film and when he is on the screen he is clearly the best actor here, I just don't really understand why he was here. His character plays no part in the plot really and it feels like a weird excuse to pad out the length by putting him in here. Anna Brewster plays Ramirez's love interest here and I mean she has the best motivations here, but they still don't work and I didn't care about their romance. There was just nothing there and no chemistry between the two performers to make it interesting or compelling. Michael Pitt plays there associate and he is that character who is just insane for being insane's sake, he has family issues but none of it is expanded enough for you to care and you really wonder why Ramirez's character even decides to work with him as it makes no sense.\n\nStory The premise of the film is pretty interesting but it is just executed so poorly, you don't care about the characters and the heist doesn't get the attention that it deserves so you aren't exactly clear why and what they are planning to do. There is a side plot with the police that isn't expanded at all and it feels like it is there for no real reason at all. The end of the film is crazy and tries to make you care about the characters but you just don't.\n\nScript The script is really boring here, the drama didn't connect with me or make me care about anything and there is literally no real humour making this a very sombre and frustrating experience.\n\nStyle The style of the film has some decent action scenes that are really over the top making them fun experiences, it is just there aren't enough of them. Plus the film is 2 and a half hours which is absurd, it drags on to a slow painful death, the film should have known what it was and aimed for 2 hours or even a little less instead of dragging on with one of the slowest paced movies you will see all year.\n\nOverall Overall, this is a really poor film, so boring and so slow. It just about avoids a 1 rating because of some fun action scenes and Sharlto Copley but it was close because I was so bored watching this film and recommend nobody waste over 2 hours of there day with it.\n\nRating - 2/10."

So much of the dialogue is mumbled so you just can't follow it and the rest is just hackneyed action cliches - one after the other.\n\nThe laws of physics are regularly bent/ignored - not unusual for action movies but when they're applied differently to different characters just to get the clunking plot vehicles moving you just can't invest in it anymore.\n\nAvoid this film and save yourself two and a half hours of your life."

Instead, this misfire went to making him and his cohorts appear just as unlikable and cutthroat as their contenders. Although if enough patience is given, the story sort of grows on you. Ultimately there are no good or bad guys, just overlapping objectives by very ruthless players."

It's set in some kind of dystopian future USA but it doesn't really say how or why this future occurred so the story was on an unsteady foundation from the start.\n\nNone of the characters back stories are fully explored and you are never really sure who they are, what their motives are and what they hope to achieve--people just seem to be passively going along with the plot for no real reason other than 'yay crime'. It feels like one of the early GTA games where the character runs around aimlessly doing whatever crime other people tell them to.\n\nBrick, the lead character lacks any real depth- he is supposed to be motivated by vengeance, although it's not quite clear how he will achieve this though the heist. However, he fails to really show any flicker of notable emotion during the entire 2.5 hour movie.\n\nThe film is so disjointed it really is impossible to follow and enjoy. It leaves you feeling of confused and frustrated.\n\nOverall the writing is just terrible and I would recommend watching any of the purge movies if you had a taste for a dystopian crime/horror of this nature on Netflix. (I'm not saying the purge is great, but it's better than this)."

Plot was lame and ending was garbage. They could have done so much better. Picked better cast, focused better on the story, but it was all over the place. The concept was there, good idea, but the acting was garbage. I feel like a this was rushed and hence why it got rated so low. I'll also rate this movie low. Nothing consistent in this story, don't see how it even made it to where it made it. I say if you absolutely have nothing to watch and real need something to pick apart. This be the film."

I watched an hour and twenty minutes, hoping it would do something to encourage me to keep watching, at which point I realised that there was almost as long left as I'd already watched, and turn it off. The story is stupid (but not in a good way). The dialogue is awful. The acting is bad. There isn't a single character who's even slightly likeable. There is nothing positive to say about this film. The only thing I can say in its defence (and it's still not a positive point) is that most of the people involved haven't made many films before or haven't made a film in a while - probably with good reason - so that might excuse how bad it is to some extent (though the director has some okay stuff on his record - I can only assume he's been in jail for a few years and now he has money problems).\n\nIf there is one positive to take from this film, it's this: if this is the standard you have to reach, anyone who wants to make a film could make one. Don't lose hope. You too could make a terrible, terrible film and still have Netflix promote it so much that people will give it a go. I imagine some people even managed to sit through the whole thing. Not many, but probably some.\n\nDisclaimer: the last hour and ten minutes might be the finest piece of cinema ever committed to film. I didn't watch it, and I doubt I ever will, so I'll never know."
