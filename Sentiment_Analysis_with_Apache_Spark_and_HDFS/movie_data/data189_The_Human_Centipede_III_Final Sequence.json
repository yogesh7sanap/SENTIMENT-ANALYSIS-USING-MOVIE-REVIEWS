        "review_detailed_main": "I've been a big supporter of writer/director Tom Six and his taboo-busting Human Centipede films since the beginning: I rated the first film 8/10, and gave the jaw-droppingly twisted sequel 9/10. The only reason I didn't give Part Two full marks was because I believed that Six still had a few tricks up his sleeve and would probably surpass himself with his third film.\n\nAs it happens, I was wrong.\n\nAs far as the controversial content is concerned, the film delivers numerous scenes that live up to Six's notorious reputation, kicking off with some sexual abuse, before proceeding to serve up such sordid treats as the torture of a prisoner with pans of boiling water, a nauseating castration scene, the insertion of a gun barrel into a man's stoma, the consumption of human testicles and dried clitorises, some wound-rape and coma-rape, and, of course, the creation of not just the biggest human centipede yet, but also a human caterpillar, the surgical process for both depicted in graphic detail.\n\nBut while the film doesn't wimp out on the deviancy, it does suffer from two major problems that make it a very unsatisfying experience overall. The first is the prison setting, which is so implausible that it renders the whole movie utterly ridiculous. The first two films, while unlikely, were at least vaguely plausible: it was possible to believe that a raving lunatic might try to stitch a few folks ass-to-mouth out of curiosity, but the notion that the head of a large correctional facility could do the same, with the co-operation of his staff, is absurd in the extreme and seriously detracts from the film's overall effectiveness as a shocker. Even when viewed as a black comedy, it's still a dumb premise.\n\nThe second issue I have is with Dieter Laser (the actor who played Dr. Heiter in the first film): his performance as sadistic warden Bill Boss is hugely irritating, the guy drawing out every single syllable at the top of his voice to the point where I would have liked to have seen HIS mouth sewn to someone's ass just to shut him up. Laurence Harvey (bug-eyed star of the second film) is also crap, but at least he's not quite as annoying. Both guys are out-acted by porn-star Bree Olson, who is also a whole lot easier on the eyes.\n\nIf the subtitle 'Final Sequence' is to be believed, this film sees an end to the Human Centipede series; it's a hugely disappointing way to wrap things up. Let's hope that Six's next film sees the director back on form: we need something to flush away any memories of this rather obnoxious mess."

They were disturbing and, in many ways, were unique.\n\nThis final installment was just annoying to watch. It did not shock and the actual, 'centipede' part didn't even happen until very late in the movie.\n\nThis movie was a massive let down and the radical departure from the stylistic form of the first two movies ruined it in my eyes.\n\nLet us hope this really is the last sequence."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bill Boss the warder of a tough maximum security prison watches the European art house black comedy films involving the human centipedes and invites the films director Tom Six to see how viable this would be in real life\n\nI can't say I was a massive fan of the original HC . I missed out on the sequel and only watched this one because I had the opportunity of seeing it free and contains the bizarre casting of Eric Roberts and former porn star Bree Olson. On top of all that there seemed to be a meta-fictional aspect of director Tom Six playing himself and the trailer looked good . What's wrong with investing a couple of hours in blackly comical horror ?\n\nWell to be fair the trailer is accurate in a way of \"Meglomaniac abuses power and really pushes the boat out\" but the execution is dreadful . Dieter Laser looks totally camp in the trailer as Bill Boss and while the performance is bearable in a two minute trailer it's not in a feature length film . I can understand that he's not supposed to be taken seriously for a moment but that's not really the point as he shouts , squeals and uses lots and lots of swear words while inflicting violence on people . It's not satire we're watching but absolute farce and Laser becomes painfully irritating , so much so that you find yourself looking forward to Eric Roberts appearing if only to see a calm and reserved performance . Yes chaps you read that right - Eric Roberts probably gives the most calm , rational and realistic acting performance in the entire movie . I suppose you could also give Tom Six a back handed compliment in making a sequel that is a billion light years removed from the original movie but nothing about it really works and in cinematic terms it feels like a juvenile delinquent who wants to shock the adult world but just ends up looking silly . Take this insult:\n\n\"Not even the corpse of a spastic would want you . Now f--k off\"\n\nThat's probably the most witty line in the film and I've come out with funnier compliments throughout my entire life which hopefully says more about THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE III than it says about me"

There is no way, any sane human being would believe that this was in any way imaginable a good idea. It has some of the worst acting i have ever seen in my entire life from every single person in this film and will someone tell Dieter Laser to STOP BLOODY SHOUTING EVERY DAMN SENTENCE LIKE WE ARE 100km AWAY, JEEZ. And on top of the god- awful acting it comes accompanied by the worst scripts in history, and a plot that made absolutely no sense whatsoever, in fact, there was no plot for 90% of this thing. This is 'The Human Centipede' right? SO WHERE WAS THE CENTIPEDE FOR THE FIRST HOUR AND 20 MINUTES??? I honestly do not know which was more difficult to sit through, the surgery (or lack thereof) or that piece of garbage that was the culmination of bad acting, writing, directing and everything else. There were a few times where the film showed signs of trying to be satirical and even self aware but it was so ridiculously dumb that by that point you just want to gouge your eyes out. I don't even know why i am still wasting my time talking about this when i just wasted an hour and 40 minutes of my life watching it. So here's the score and if you want to subject yourself to torture be my guest because i'm out. - 0.3/10"

Tom Six seems to not understand this and only wanted to make a comedic sequel just for the sake of it being \"different\". I've seen this happen with other horror sequels, and it never turns out well. The comedy itself was in bad taste.. as a few others have pointed out.\n\nYou know a movie is going to be bad when you have a porn star (Bree Olson) as one of the main cast."

This on the other hand can't get the basics right. The acting is god awful. Its worse than just being flat because the main character, governor Hughes, yells out every damn line he has. Even after this it still somehow has the problem of NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR/UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. The audio is pretty poor. The dialogue at times is muffled by the soundtrack, which is pretty pathetic. How long is the film? 2hrs and 20 minutes! If you are going to make a piece of crap then at least make it 1hr and 30 max.\n\nSo what about the \"plot\"? Governor Hughes is shown the first two films first thing in the film. You would think that the main character, Hughes, a over the top Texan loudmouth psychopath who abuses his prisoners, would get the idea that he has been shown the film because his accountant wants to do it for real. Nope. Instead we have a long drawn out tour of the prison. There is though a decent message to the film about the state of prison abuse and the contempt of the Americans to actually care. Sadly it beats you over the head with it in the final 20 minutes of the film.\n\nAs for the gore there are two decent scenes. There is a waterboarding with boiling water and a mutilation. I would not watch the film just to see those scenes simply because it is surrounded by 2 hrs of yelling and boredom.\n\nHuman Centipede is a sad, and surprisingly tame and boring, end to the series."

This was one of my anticipated horror films of 2015 and I must say I was really disappointed.

The film is filled with perversely sick moments, immaturely psychotic performance, and shocking GORES that's intended to make you puke and gross you out instead of making a gleefully enjoyable one to watch. One of the main problems here is the performance of Dieter Laser which make him looks like Marlon Wayans going pull psycho which is amusing to watch for like 5 minutes and the rest is just childishly annoying and just dull, making the film laughable and looks like a parody of itself. Another problem is how the story drags out and we have to sit through the whole psychotically dull act and vulgarly racist dialogue before the final sequences happen which is nothing that surprising since most of them are already shown in the trailer. Overall, The Final Sequence is crude, vulgar, perversely sick, over-the-top in its violence and chessily insane performance, yet still ends up too dull to enjoy even for the fans of the genre.\n\n>>C-<<"

Like the other films, the ending definitely isn't happy. It is, however, consistent with the earlier films and bizarre enough that it should please those seeking the horror/gore originality that probably got them to watch it initially."

The movie leads itself to being a sequel within a new movie premise taken a step further from how part 2 was to 1. Kudos to Tom Six for making sequels that don't follow the traditional role, but smack him at the same time for being so pretentious to think a film fan won't see right through his arrogance. Multiple scenes of what Tom considers humor point this out entirely by being long, drawn out scenes with Deiter Laser (Bill Boss) acting like a complete jackass overacting a joke to the point that would make Jim Carrey cringe. Basically the story in a nutshell (about all you need) is a deranged prison warden (Laser) decides at his last straw to use the ideas from the Human Centipede movies to punish criminals and deter further offenders to ever break the law. This revelation is made when the governor (played by, wait for it, Eric Roberts) gives Boss 2 weeks to get his prison in order. What better way then take all the prisoners and sew them ass to mouth together, right? Anyway, back to the gore, a scene or two MAY have been considered \"gross\" years ago, but there is nothing to raw at all. Some of the humor is quite funny in a very dark way (his idea of health food is one of them) but the overshadowing of the poor acting is a deterrent (in other words, yes, it is a b- budget movie BUT it was so painfully obvious the actors were purposely acting bad to become a b-budget movie) So again the numbnut,Tom Six, thinks he is outsmarting the audience with this backasswards attempt at laughs. These laughs tend to come more from suggestion and the cheesy attempt at being an exploitative film(women should love a secretary named \"Tits\") All and all, it has the pros but is to outweighed by the cons. Good news, it was only supposed to be a trilogy, so we may be spared of another one."

It arrived at the tail end of an era of torture porn horror films, including the final entry of the Saw franchise a mere six months later, but took the genre in a new direction with the inclusion of a mad-scientist angle. Dieter Laser chewed the scenery as Dr. Heiter, carrying out an experiment that Six still insists to be 100% medically accurate.\n\nIf The Human Centipede was shocking in concept and followed through with execution, the sequel somehow managed to increase both creativity and shock value. The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) has moments of absolute brilliant excess in the actual nitty-gritty of the film's abuse and degradation under the thin pretense of medical experimentation, but the real genius comes in the actual concept of the movie's plot. Rather than keep the same villain from the first film, the sequel is about a nearly mute psychopath named Martin (Laurence R. Harvey), whose obsession with The Human Centipede film leads him to carry out his own makeshift experiment. This time around, the promise was for carnage that is 100% medically inaccurate.\n\nHere's where things get tricky; now I have to review The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) having already explained that the first sequel doubled down on both creativity and shocking gore. Anyone who has experienced the first two films will first and foremost want to know if the film manages to top the prior two. The answer is yes, but not in the ways that you would expect, and likely not the way most horror fans would have hoped. In terms of shocking sequences, The Human Centipede III comes nowhere close to the previous installment. On the other hand, this is the most striking in terms of political and social satire, fittingly given the tagline \"100% Politically Incorrect.\" And the film still has its hand at excess, though this time it comes in the form of Dieter Laser's delightfully over-the-top performance.\n\nFor the rest of the review and more visit www.rizayreviews.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "All right guys, I literally never do this... in fact, I have NEVER done this... but I absolutely hated this movie (and I did not feel this way about the first two)\n\nNot even 10 minutes in and it was so wildly cringe I wanted to erase it from the face of the earth, let alone just my tv screen. It was this weird mix of a wannabe Mel Brooks movie, a soft core and an awful Troma movie. Honestly, it was just all around irritating with it's incessant yelling and melodrama.\n\nThe script was bad. The acting was bad. The concept was tired and silly. I thought that the warden did good as the doctor in the first movie, but this was just... insufferable. His delivery was... well, out of this world... quite literally. It was like an alien trying to poorly imitate the human inflection. It got to the point where it was almost incomprehensible.\n\nEverything they were attempting to do with this movie stylistically was apparent... I understood the schtick and the vibe, but it was wildly unsuccessful. To be quite honest, to date, this is the worst movie I've seen. Again, I've literally never said that. The only good part about this was inmate 297 just cause he was kinda hot lol\n\nAlso, as a side note, there's nothing cool about superfluously throwing around the n word for no apparent reason either.\n\nThe only reason I finished this movie was because I think it's unfair to write a review on a movie that you didn't complete... but dang...and the fact that I had to sit through this for almost 2 hours is an actual crime. All I can say is I hope they enjoyed the process and had fun on set. 1.5 rounding up to a 2 because... it was literally a completed film. That's it. Would not recommend."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have an unusual hobby. I like to occasionally watch horrible films, as I find many of them unintentionally funny. Because of this passion, I have seen every movie in Harry Medved's \"The 50 Worst Movies\" and nearly all of IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. However, of all these bad films, one I simply could not bring myself to finish was \"The Human Centipede II\" as I found it so overwhelmingly disgusting, stupid and awful that I simply couldn't finish the job. This made my watching \"The Human Centipede III\" something I really did NOT look forward to doing! Should I have paid more attention to my brain and simply refused to see this third film? To put it bluntly...yes.\n\nWhen the film begins, you can't help but marvel at Dieter Laser as he plays the crazy Warden. I couldn't believe how bad an actor he was and what a horrible performance he could give as this very, very stupid character. Warden Boss is like a cartoon character....so evil he's utterly ridiculous. He overacts constantly and is so dumb and awful you just need to see and hear him to believe it! Additionally, his heavy German accent simply made it sound as if he'd JUST learned English a few minutes before attempting this role! Is he completely to blame? No...the writer and director must own some of this as well, though I strongly suspect they were penguins as I cannot imagine a person directing or writing THIS poorly. His character is 100% sadism and 100% stupid....to the point where he becomes tedious....and dumber than Tor Johnson in \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\"!\n\nOverall, this movie was SLIGHTLY less disgusting than the prior film but the utter stupidity of the script and Laser put it in a class all by itself. I would clearly place this in a list NOT of the worst 100...but worst dozen films ever made. It' THAT bad...that pointless...that offensive...and that amateurish. A truly awful pile of dog vomit of a film...with a loud, brash, obnoxious no-talent leading it all in the form of Warden Boss!"

Secondly, most of Bill Boss' dialogue is yelled instead of spoken. This makes it both extremely annoying and inaudible (I actually had to put subtitles on to understand what he was talking about). Don't even get me started on the forced, fake American accent the accountant put on throughout this shocking excuse for a film. Seriously, what was all that about? I like gore in a movie. I do. I am a horror movie addict, but even the scenes of torture were not even scary. Maybe I'm just desensitized now, but I just found the first 'Human Centipede' to be much sicker.

Director Tom Six presents the third installment to the repulsive franchise (The human Centipede) fingers crossed it truly is the \"final sequence\". It's offensive at all measures, unforgivably insane and transparently foolish. This film rebelliously dismisses the boundaries of film-making and goes overboard purely for shock factor. Dieter Laser's performance was unnecessarily over the top and gave me a headache, however his insults were priceless. There were no character developments resulting to thin emotional attachment towards the leads, but that's obviously Mr. Six' intent as he only cares about its obnoxious content which still lacked fluency and substance.\n\nThe cinematography was descent but seemed like it was heavily inspired by Robert Rodriguez' style. The practical effects were extremely realistic and the lighting really set the tone which promoted the environment. With these few excuses of my 3/10 rating out of the way, what annoyed me most about this film besides its shameful acting, and crummy direction. Is the fact that Tom six proves to me how cocky a film-maker can become, he plays himself in this excuse of a film and there are literally scenes where characters praise his previous movies and asks for his autograph, like SERIOUSLY?\n\nThis film is like a bad hangover, it leaves an unforgettable after taste of discomfort and dread. The unintentionally hilarious dialog is its saving grace but at the same time it's no way near forgivable for its constipated plot and pacing. This film takes everything the previous films left out and gives them laxatives and then splatters them onto the screen, is this what you call art Mr. Six, take a good hard look at your career and tell me if you're proud to put this on your resume? After my viewing I brushed my teeth twice and had a long shower. A terrible movie in terms of entertainment and quality, at all costs stay away.\n\nFinal Rating (Popcorn Metre) 9%"

The actors tried hard as possible, but how great can a movie be that makes a throw back to the first two movies every four minutes. The first two movies are classics, but this one is worse than Jason X. Jason X makes fun of itself, but at least shows some decent gore.\n\nIt would be better to be left in the middle of the human centipede at the end of the first one than to have to sit through this movie again.\n\nMaybe now that we watched this movie we can volunteer at a nursing home or soup kitchen, just to know own human existence is more than one disappointing Tom Six movie."

Harvey banding together as a new villainous duo aspiring to connect over 500 human bodies together.\n\nDo any of you remember my review of The Human Centipede 2 where I said I'm not going to watch the other one just because I was that grossed out and angry at the time, and I also didn't know they were making a third movie at the time of that review. I just found out a couple of days about this movie and how it was the final which I had the thought of \"Oh god I'm going to watch no matter what I'm I\", and I sure did. I know some of you are thinking \"Matt why on earth would you watch this movie since you hated the last two movies and what are expecting from this disgusting film series\". I know I should know better and I originally had no plans on seeing this one since I still think the second movie is the worst horror movie ever made, but since I already seen and review the first and second movie I thought to myself \"Why not finish this horrible franchise of torture porn\". These no surprise this movie sucked big time but what really surprise me is how boring the movie is.\n\nI hate the fact that this movie is self aware of the others movies as the character's watch and talk about them and how they look like them even when it's the same actor. The other thing that really grinds my gears while watching this movie is how the character's treat the movie director Tom Six (Yes he's in this movie playing himself) like a god to film making, even when he's not and he's just another Eli Roth clone.\n\nDieter Laser makes a return in this movie and his acting in this movie is so over the top crewing up the scenery that it got to the point that it annoyed the crap out. His character in the movie is so annoying I mean oh my god although the movie he never stops yelling and he was being a total tool to everyone around him. I mean every scene this guy is on he's always screaming, knocking things over and yelling on the top of his lungs and it really got on my nerves to the point were I turned down the volume just to enjoy the silence.\n\nThe whole movie is deep inside and out ugly just ugliness. Everybody in this movie is awful human being and how this movie treats women is unspeakably awful.\n\nNow Human Centipede 3 isn't as horrid or disgusting as the second movie I mean I almost throw up watching that movie. Yeah you get your graphic and gory violence in this one, but this time I didn't feel the need to throw up and take a shower every minute like the second made me do.\n\nOverall The Human Centipede 3 is a dull mindless Peace of sh*t gory feast that only sick in the head people would find enjoyment."

Both of these characters are truly awful, and both of them are played by truly awful actors, I found them to be near unwatchable. The temptation to hit the ffwd button was great. The first movie was incredibly twisted and unoriginal, yet very light on gore. With part 3 Tom Six goes for comedy and gore, but jokes about such things as female circumscim aren't very funny. The film clocks in a around 100 minutes but there's no centipede until the last 10. This film is awful, the reasons why I'm scoring it 2 and not 1 out of 10 is that there is some good gore, plus it has Bree Olson and Eric Roberts in the cast (I bet he keeps quiet about this one!) I hope this is the Final Sequence. Abysmal."

But then when i heard it was going to be a comedy i thought: \"This can't end well\" and my suspicions were right, not only was it not funny, but there was no aspect of this film that was enjoyable at all. The Acting is bad. Dialogue is awful. Writing is overall horrendous.\n\nThe thing i hated the most about this film was the main-character, i could not understand a word that he was saying because every single word that came out of his mouth would be him shouting at the top of his lungs.\n\nCompared to the second film, this one is pretty tame in terms of gore/violence so don't expect it to top the second.\n\nIt's a shame because it could have been a decent trilogy and would have been fun to marathon with some friends...but alas. So all-in- all, give the first and second a chance because they are pretty decent and original films but just make sure you skip this abomination."

There are many sick moments for you sick gore hounds who crave sick guilty pleasures, one, the first or second bloody moment, ala Zero Dark Thirty, only with hot water. The story almost has you, dangerously contemplating on whether performing the practice of joining 500 violent unruly prisoners, head to bum cheek, forming the biggest centipede yet, would work in the real world. But it would have some prison guards heavily contemplating this too. But this is totally inhuman, where here's a prison that's way understaffed, inundated with bedlam. But hey, this is a movie, and quite a sick depraved, repellent one, where our leads, from the previous two return. The man running the show is (Laser HC1) who's consistent and inane shouting, really got on my goat, the truly most annoying thing, may'be the only annoying thing in this film. Playing the assistant governor, is (Harvey HC2) donning a Southern accent, again, playing a pathetic pitiable character. And we have a hot female blonde receptionist with big jugs, who sternly obeys Governor Laser's commands, mostly of sexual services and whims. Eric Roberts is wasted as a visiting governor. This third centipede may not be as bad as you expect it to be or not. There are predictiabilities in plot, as in Roberts change of heart, and Laser's betrayal in the finale. What we're left in with the Human Centipede 3, besides 500 pi..ed off actors with bad backs, act are a lot of tasty sick instances in a mess of a film . Even director Six, gets in on the act, playing himself, but throwing in quite a good performance as himself, the film maker, seeing at first hand, if the operation of 500 bad buns joined together, will work. This was the part they left too late of the movie, where there wasn't blood shed here."

I really couldn't see the point other than shock value but by the time anything happened I was sick of all the nonsense that was being said. If you have not seen either of the first two films it would be a good idea not to start here. This film was a big disappointment to fans of the first two films. Human centipede two is the best!!!"

Never ever did i liked it, sure, here and there we do have some horror and gory moments but that doesn't make a good flick. The centipede is there at the final of the flick but you really have to wait over an hour before it's made and even that isn't shown. Only one face being stitched to one's ass that's all.\n\nMaybe for some Daisy (Bree Olson) will be worth checking out, voluptuous blond coming out of the XXX genre and doing what she does best, looking sexy.\n\nPart 3 is just boring as hell, doesn't deliver a thing, what have you done Tom Six?

With 'The Human Centipede 3', writer- director Tom Six takes this self-referential angle even further, focusing on prison staff inspired by the first two movies who invite Tom Six to supervise their construction of a real prisoner human centipede. Dieter Laser - who was the lead actor in Part 1 - is the prison warden and has several amusing lines as he declares that the first two 'Centipede' films \"stink\" and calls Six \"an infatuated toddler\". Six's cameo is a lot of fun too; same goes for his choice to retain Laurence R. Harvey playing a totally different character. Six trips up though by giving Laser free reign to go as over-the-top as he likes as the warden, driven insane by heat. It is a distracting exaggerated performance and one that unjustly takes up most of the screen time, with the construction of Laser's centipede left to the final quarter of the movie. In short, those who liked the self-referential elements of Part 2 will still find a lot to like here, but those in it for the shocks and graphic imagery may be disappointed. And for those who did not like either aspect of the second film, what are you doing reading this review?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Probably one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. Not because it is a Human Centipede film, don't get me wrong on that. I am a huge fan of the first two parts, just because the psychological analysis of a serial killer is something that makes for a really good splatter and horror movie.\n\nBut this movie is different, the movie starts with the actors of Dr. Heiter and Martin, which was odd but I kinda liked the idea. The movie however then started to taper off really quickly. You can tell from the get-go that Tom Six just ran out of ideas, he just wants to show offensive violence for the sake of offensive violence. You can most easily compare this to a child not being obedient and doing something bad just to get attention from his parents. This is exactly what this movie feels like, there is no hidden message in this one that made me watch the movie twice (or fully even once for that matter) just because of the way how dull and stock this movie is.\n\nThe main character is merely an over-exaggerated clich\u00e9-psycho which does not fit into the human centipede series at all. Dieter Laser was a whole lot better in the role as Dr. Heiter, it was just suited for him. He was a somewhat introverted, deranged psycho-doctor, which was great. He fitted perfectly into his old role, this just looks like a brute-forced attempt to plaster a new, completely unauthentic image onto him which has him feeling like: \"Hey, I do this, because it looks weird, this is how the average person would describe a psycho, I am so original right now, please give me attention, I am such a psycho\".\n\nMaking him a prison-warden does not fit him, half of the time you can't even understand him properly through all the tirades and conniptions of futile and pointless yelling with which he tries to convince the audience of his authenticity as a clumsy cartoon psycho. The only thing he will convince you of though is that he is NOT suited for this role and that you can even give bloody \"Toy Story\" more credit for it's realism and authenticity.\n\nThe only impressive thing about this entire movie is Laurence R. Harvey, after the second Human Centipede movie I just really came to realize what a great actor he actually is. His role in the old movie was so fitting for him, in this one he almost seems like a new person, just an incredibly good actor. That's about the only upside this movie has. Poor, Tom Six, really, REALLY poor. And I was a fan of the series. Couldn't even get to the actual \"Centipede\"-part, since this movie bored and grossed the living hell out of me. Not because of the splatter but because of what they did to this otherwise incredibly good series of movies. In other words: The only really cruel thing that happens in this movie is that all the work and reputation Tom Six built himself up is getting splattered through this one blight in an otherwise great movie history.\n\nDon't watch this if you are a fan of the series, seriously, you will just pull down your own opinion about the entire sequels."

Again, what is it with Six and these god awful movies? If I could give this sorry excuse of a film a zero, I would.\n\nEric Roberts cannot save this film. Dieter Laser, for all of the awesome work he did in Lexx, cannot and has not saved two of the three films in this insipid series. Lawrence Harvey? Please god, don't subject me to any more of his \"acting\", period. And as for the porn star of the movie, Bree Olson? Stick to being a mattress actress, lady. No one is going to take you seriously. And now, back to the film itself.\n\nI would rather be boiled alive in 500 degree water than watch this again. I would rather tear my own eyes out than watch this ever again.

It has both the lead actors from the previous films (Dieter Laser and Laurence R. Harvey) playing different leading roles in this installment. The movie also features supporting turns from Eric Roberts, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, Bree Olson and Robert LaSardo. The story deals with an insane (and very sadistic) warden, that decides to turn his entire 500 inmate prison population, into a human centipede. The idea for the madness comes from his accountant; who was inspired with the idea, by watching the first two films (obsessively). The movie has been severely panned by critics, and movie watchers alike; it has a 9% positive rottentomatoes critic score (with an average rating of 1 out of 10) and an average IMDb user rating of 3.5 out of 10! I admire movies that push creative limits; but this film is far too offensive, to give it any real credit.\n\nBill Boss is a racist, sexist and completely insane prison warden (Laser); who's constantly trying to gain respect from the inmates, he watches over. He tries several different sadistic techniques, to beat the prisoners into submission (including castrating one, and disfiguring another, by water-boarding him with boiling water). When his job is threatened by the governor (Roberts), his right-hand man, and prison accountant, Dwight Butler (Harvey), suggests the idea that they turn all of the prisoners into a 500 person long, human centipede. Boss sees the idea as the ultimate form of submission, and loves it.\n\nThe movie is about as vulgar, crude, disgusting and offensive as a film can get! I saw both previous installments, which I gave both zero star ratings to, and although this installment isn't quite as dark, and gory, as the others; it's still even more disgusting and tasteless. Like the other films, in the trilogy, it's one that will always stay with me, in a very haunting and disturbing way. I respect filmmakers that try to push the boundaries, of what's acceptable and normal, but these films are far too immoral to give the writer/director (Tom Six) any credit for. The only purpose any of these movies have, is to get an uncomfortable physical reaction from the viewer; there's nothing intellectual about them at all (no hidden meaning). I wish I could like these films, and admire them for being so bold, but I can't. 'THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE III (FINAL SEQUENCE)', like the other two chapters, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen!\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/vvaTQ0fcFUQ"

The sequel had its moments, much of the inspiration had gone but the casting of Laurence Harvey was good. I like the black and white but it appeared Tom was beginning to run out of ideas and simply riding off the first movie.\n\nThen comes this repugnant amateurish pile. Where to start with its problems? The acting is beyond terrible, the dialogue even worse, you cannot make out what Dieter Laser is saying most of the time which is surprising since he shouts almost every single line. Laurence Harvey worked well in the second movie but not in this one, he is not a good actor and his attempt at an American accent is laughable. Bree Olson is what she is, a porn actress trying to get into mainstream, I kinda feel sorry for her as she is extremely ill treated throughout the film and Eric Roberts chews the scenery like never before despite his brief appearance. One or two of the inmates do OK but in general the acting is as bad as you could ever see. Not a stellar cast by any chance but they should be capable of more, in my opinion this is down to dreadful direction, what Tom Six was thinking when he extracted these performances I will never know. Did none of the actors or film crew take him to one side and explain how ridiculous it was? The story is incoherent and without substance but even the best storyline couldn't hope to come through with the performances as poor and over the top as they were. There are a couple of gore scenes which are decent and certainly make the eyes water, Tom Six at least maintains that.\n\nIt is a shame that this franchise has ended so weakly. I hope it isn't the end of Toms career but he needs to prove he isn't just a one sick trick pony. However, one thing is certain, I will remember Dieter Laser for the most ridiculous, over the top performance of all time."

His assistant eventually persuades him to copy Tom Six's idea from the Human Centipede films, and hook all the prisoners together ass to mouth, creating more of a 'human caterpillar' than a centipede.\n\nGiven the massive furore over the last film, which struggled to secure a certificate in the UK despite being more of a post modern, tongue in cheek variation on the original and far less upsetting, this third and , we're promised (hopefully, really) last instalment in the HC franchise, has arrived with far less fanfare and, as such, probably far less anticipation. Since neither of the first two got really great reviews (especially, quite rightly, not the terrible second part!) it could be that the demand for the third part simply isn't through the roof, and in spite of having the most excessive and disgusting idea of them all, there's been no attempts to ban it. But it's a strange cookie all of its own.\n\nThis time round, the emphasis seems to be purely on laughs, with references to the first two films included, and everything played up for the most campy effect possible. Even the HC concept has been blown to the most outrageous lengths imaginable, and has more of a silly element attached to it, which, with less sympathetic victims isn't so unthinkable, even if the poster itself is enough to twist your mind. There's certainly no way lead star Laser could be doing anything but playing it for laughs, turning in the most hammy, overboard, comical performance you can imagine. The irony of having him, as the star of the original film, co starring with the star of the sequel in totally different roles isn't lost on anyone either, especially not, it seems, director Tom Six.\n\nThis is a series that certainly hasn't played out in what you'd call the 'traditional sense', gradually turning into a bizarre parody of itself as it's gone along, but it's secured something of a cult following for itself anyway, and this is probably the most enjoyable entry, coming from the angle of a non sick, easy going mind. ***"

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh, Tom Six. How I admire you. For all of the grief people give you over your films, it cannot be denied that you have a drive and ambition, and have been instrumental in bringing body-horror one of its most unique franchises of recent time.\n\nAnd I certainly cannot speak ill of the man's talents. The first two films in his infamous \"Human Centipede\" trilogy are oddly and undeniably solid pieces of cinema, with good, competent direction, wonderful visuals and even some great self-aware meta-humor. (I particularly admire the second film, which I find to be a tragically underrated and misunderstood piece of pitch-black satire.)\n\nBut unfortunately, it appears Icarus may have flown too close to the sun during this third outing, as \"Human Centipede III (Final Sequence)\" suffers a slew of issues and problems that hold it back as not only the worst film of the trilogy, but also one of the most disappointing horror and comedy films of recent memory. It's honestly surprising how much of a step-down the film is.\n\nThe film follows prison warden Bill Boss and his assistant Dwight Butler (played respectively by Dieter Laser and Laurence R. Harvey, who both portrayed villains in the previous films). Boss is a violent, depraved, cannibalistic nutcase who believe extreme violence and torture are the only things that can keep his prison under control (just wait till you see what he eats for lunch!), while Dwight is a meek man forced to go along with all of his schemes. However, upon seeing the first two \"Human Centipede\" films on DVD, Dwight hatches a plan to control the inmates- put them all into one of the titular \"Human Centipedes\" (Which connect multiple people via a seamless digestive system by connecting the mouth of one to the anus of another) to make them easier to control, and make them the ultimate deterrent to those who would otherwise consider a life of crime.\n\nWhile this is indeed an interesting-enough set-up for a climactic and insane finale, the fact is, the film crumbles under it's own desire to be depraved and up-the-stakes presented in the first two films, all while also trying to do something new.\n\nThe film reaches too far and stretches itself thin from the first moment to the anti-climactic finale. (Don't worry, I won't spoil anything, but I will say fans of the first two films will likely be let down by the final 15 minutes.) Actors over-act madly, gore is thrown in by the bucket-full, language goes full-bore into nonstop profanity, the \"ick\" factor is piled on with taboo after taboo being broken... yet it feels so vapid because it's so far over-the-top it can no longer be identified as either horror or comedy. And as a result, the film becomes too cartoonish (and thus feels shockingly tame in comparison to the previous two) to be taken seriously in any way. Even as a self-parodying comedy, which its clearly striving to be, it's too much.\n\nParticularly Dieter Laser... Good lord, Dieter. You were the best thing in the first film, yet in this third entry, you single handedly destroy the entire film with your scenery chewing. Laser's Bill Boss is the \"Jar Jar Binks\" of horror- a cartoon that wouldn't appeal to anyone over the age of 5 due to nonstop \"silly antics.\"\n\nReally, the only good things about this film to me were a humorous cameo by director Tom Six himself, and one brilliant joke revolving around whether or not the concept of a human centipede would violate a doctor's Hippocratic oath.\n\nI'm really disappointed by this film. I enjoyed the first and adored the second. And I do admire the intent behind this third film- bringing the series even further into the realm of broad, perverse, satirical comedy. It just doesn't work because it doesn't know when to slow down or stop.\n\nI give it a 3 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "A brutal, deranged prison warden, Bill Boss, knows no limits or laws when it comes to maintaining discipline in his prison, and in carrying out his sadistic urges. Then, influenced by watching the Human Centipede movies, his sidekick Dwight suggests that he create a human centipede out of the prisoners. It will cut their food costs...\n\nThe original The Human Centipede was disgusting in its plot, but not very graphic. This was a redeeming quality, as it left a lot to the imagination, and left room for a plot. While not good, it turned out to be not as bad as expected.\n\nThe second film had far less redeeming qualities. It was graphic in its violence, surgical scenes and centipedal scenes, and very disgusting, and gratuitous. Plot was quite basic. Overall the movie was pretty bad.\n\nThis, the third movie, is even worse than the second. Concept is even more gross than the first two movies and the movie is quite graphic. Plot is close to non-existent - things just lurch from one random scene to the next, with the only plot aim being the creation of the centipede.\n\nSo, far incredibly bad. However, taking the movie to new heights (or its it depths?) of craptacularity is the performance of Dieter Laser as Bill Boss. I have not seen a worse performance in the history of cinema, or anything (and I've seen Kristen Stewart \"act\"). His \"acting\" consists entirely of shouting and massively overacting. Yes, some of this is the director's fault, but there is a limit. Even insane people do not act that deranged.\n\nAwful beyond belief."

Parts 1 and 2 of this series were no great shakes, but at least they proved the 2 main actors and director Tom Six were halfway competent at their jobs- so what the hell happened here? Was it SUPPOSED to be so awful that it was almost unwatchable as some sort of in joke?? It's hard to know where to begin. The plot (clearly a rather clumsy satire of the U.S. Penal system as run by the likes of the notorious Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio) makes no sense, even as a comedy. The acting, by everybody concerned but particularly the 2 leads is beyond excruciating- it's painful at times to watch. Even gore hounds will be disappointed- the actual centipede seems like an afterthought, not appearing until 10 minutes before the close, and the occasional disgusting moments (a castration, colostomy bag being ripped out etc) utterly fail in their attempts to shock- quite simply because the film's badness is more shocking than anything that could possibly be put on screen. Is it worth seeing as a curiosity, to see how a movie COULD be this bad? Possibly, for the first few minutes, but then boredom quickly sets in- this isn't one of those films that's so bad it's funny. It's so bad it's actively unpleasant and annoying to watch.....avoid, like the plague!!"

In this film there is flat out racism from the lead character including racial slurs and attacks against prisoners. As well as this, when there is a prison riot , a black man is seen punching a woman. The lead character is loud obnoxious and racist to the point it seems as if the 4 chan neo nazi edge lords posts on the internet seem like Disney. This doesn't get any better as the film progresses and the ending is just racism again. Of course this guy wins. Imagine viewing this film through the eyes of the alt right neo nazi movement, they would be cheering him on and laughing. The character is also heavily misogynistic, even raping a woman as she's in comatose after being beaten up. There are no other attempts to flesh out his character, no biting satire. Just a nazi rambling and doing offensive stuff for the sake of it. It's like a glorification of it. Whatever subtext that pretends to be about American justice systems falls flat as it's not explored enough and the racism seems by the numbers for Hollywood Institutional racism. In the same way that the second film made mental health and abuse victims look like psychos, (another Hollywood trope,) this film is nothing more than glorifying racist attacks and neo nazi thoughts. In a very loud and obnoxious way."

But that's why I watched it. I felt the same revulsion after watching the first film, but it quickly became one of my all-time favorite horror films. I won't say that this one is as good as the first one, but it's a fun ride ride if you are a fan of the genre.\n\nParanormal Activity fans should just skip this one and stick to horror lite. You won't get it. This is for hardcore horror fans. With all of the pile of crap B movies out there that truly suck, I am amazed that there are so many 1 star ratings here. This film was well acted, well written, and very entertaining. I suspect many of the poor reviews are due to disgust and the actual movie. Or maybe it was the lack of nudity? Who knows.

The idea alone was enough to carry the film and the results were indeed brilliant and shocking. Then there came the problem that writer/director Tom Six wanted a sequel, in fact a couple of them. The idea alone was no longer going to be shocking enough to carry them. He had to up the ante. And that's exactly what he did with 'The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)'. In fact he upped it possibly more than he needed to. It truly was an incredibly shocking film, with one scene in particular really standing out in my memory. The only problem was that made upping the ante again for part three even tougher. Did he manage it? All I can say is he gave it a hell of a try.\n\nThe movie really is carried by the lead character of Bill Boss, played by Dieter Laser who also starred in the original. In what must have been an exhausting performance to pull off, he is simply going full throttle from scene one to the dying seconds of the film. He gives it his all and he pulls it off. The character is captivating to watch and wonder what he is going to do next. Laurence R. Harvey, the star of part two, also returns in a little more toned down role this time, as do some other actors in smaller parts. In fact even Tom Six himself makes an appearance this time around.\n\nIt goes without saying that this film won't be for everyone, however I absolutely loved it. A number of scenes are again truly shocking and the overall plot of the film is nothing short of fascinating. It's far from highbrow, Oscar winning cinema, but then it never sets out to be anything of the sorts. It's there to entertain its audience and that it does in spades."

Laser's constant screaming did make it difficult to understand what he was saying, but his body language made up for it. As some have criticized, it does take a bit long to get to the sequencing, and you don't see the detail that the other films had, but by this point, since most have seen the other two films, its more the idea that's important than the execution of it.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Human Centipede: Final Sequence (Tom Six, USA, 2015)\n\nWell what can I say about this one! A bloody lot actually. I will be the first to admit I actually like the first movie, despite the premise of course not medically accurate, it managed to get black comedy in the middle of disturbing scenes. The second, while uncomfortable to an extent when it began getting repetitive after a while and I don't care for the characters or the acting in it. However, the direction, cinematography and Laurence R. Harvey saved the film giving it a grim, unclean environment. Now (for the final time we hope), Final Sequence this time is about the Warden Bill Boss (Dieter Laser from the first) of an unpopular prison that is threaten closure from many riots, medical costs and staff turnovers by Governor Hughes (Eric Roberts). Bill is a drunk, insane, loudmouth individual who rants and drinks throughout trying to control the prisoners and the fear of termination. However, his right hand man Dwight (Harvey returning from the second) suggests the possibility of creating a human centipede of 500 people as a solution.\n\nSo the idea of this movie is it is a self aware satire on the series and American Prisons. Tom Six in an interview stated this will be the sickest Human Centipede film yet. Ironically, it actually turns out to not be very gory and oh boy, it's bloody tame (for some people, I think it could be an advantage). The gory moments are brief and really not shocking because we're not interested or care about any of the characters. Honestly, the whole movie is ranting, drinking, suggestion to make Human Centipede, Bill rejects the idea, some brief scenes of the prisoners, sexism to the character of Daisy (Bree Olson) and it repeats over and over until the last 30 minutes. The production values are completely cheap in comparison to the previous with the colour grading of orange to the over-the-top acting mainly from Laser (who was uncomfortably disturbing, yet darkly comic in the first) gives one of the most exasperating performances in recent years.\n\nThe self-awareness of the fact how they mention the fact the previous movies are messed up feels like a cheap excuse of defending the film and forces it throughout to the point a cameo from Tom Six comes in to giving an impression that he wants the series to be over! Lastly, because of the repetition of the plot structure, the pacing truly drags and feels more lifeless as it goes on. In conclusion, I wasn't offended by the film, that must surprised you. However, I state this film is smug, tame, repetitive and lifeless! Really, I don't want this film to be banned at all, instead how about we watch the great controversial films and remove this as a popular controversial film!"

Tom Six is a damn moron with a snuff fetish who, unfortunately for the world, was in a position to produce a film. The entire thing is absolutely bloody awful. The \"gore\" is bland dog turd, there is very few actually shocking scenes, it's as if a mentally retarded pigeon watched the first two movies and defecated this one out. Nearly two hours of Dieter Laser screaming his irritating bloody lungs out with his enormously effing annoying voice. It was so bad that for the first time since discovering IMDb many years ago, I actually made an account. Just to post this review. And posting this review without using profanity has been INDESCRIBABLY difficult."

The answer would definitely look like the final installment of the Human Centipede series.\n\nFrom highly-improbable scenarios to disappointing technical issues, Human Centipede III is a lesson on the things a movie should not do.\n\nI'm certain that HC fans were expecting the most bizarre and graphical depiction of the creation of the ultimate mouth-to-anus chimera, but practically only a glimpse of the beast was shown during the anti-climax. Same with the \"Human Caterpillar\". Probably as a black comedy this movie could work: Dieter Laser character's yelling lines were absolutely hilarious, as well as the scenes where he pushes his secretary out of the office. Also, when have you seen a Governor that looks as unkempt as the one in the movie? Even the appearance of Tom six himself was risible (remember the music that played every time he drives his Mercedes into the prison?).\n\nConclusion: If you have watched the previous HC films and you are bored to hell, watch this. If not, well, don't bother and watch the first one."

The first two were horror/exploitation movies that had a semblance of a plausible plot line but this films plot line is so far off the mark it's past Pluto. Its as if the guys who dreamed up this jewel had moved to Colorado and had spent all their time getting high which has obviously broken their minds completely. To call it crap is to be way too nice-I don't think anyone has ever made such a bad movie in the entire history of cinematography. Its absolutely disgusting. The plot of the film revolves around how the entire population of a small maximum security prison are basically killed by the warden-a bad man played so badly it was like really watching a madman at the controls. Films like this one should not be shown anywhere, especially in the current climate of pop up violence that has frequently happened in relationship to cinemas. I wonder if this film or something like it was playing in the cinemas that were part of the recent spate of cinema shootings in America. This film is dangerous. As such it should probably be banned and the master copy dropped into a deep ocean trench."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yeah, I admit it \u2013 I actually enjoyed 'The Human Centipede' \u2013 a film so depraved that many a Hollywood film critic actually claimed that its creation spelt the end of moral and intellectual cinema as we know it. Okay, so it wasn't Shakespeare, but then it wasn't meant to be, was it? It was meant to push the boundaries and generally gross us out. And it did just that. So I classed it as a success. And so did the public in general, as it spawned a sequel. Granted the next instalment took a very different path, but I enjoyed that one too (to my shame).\n\nTherefore, I was always going to give the third one a crack. And, from the start I was actually quite impressed\u0085 the film chose to reunite the (wonderfully creepy) stars of the previous two films and put them together on screen. How could this film possibly fail? It did.\n\nIt was rubbish. I'm sorry. I know I should try to back my opinions up a little more eloquently than that, but I really can't think of anything else to say. I was so disappointed. If you've seen the first film (and if you're considering watching a story about human test subjects being sewn together in the most disgusting way imaginable I suggest you start there) then you'll know the lead was the evil German doctor. Like I said, he's back here (only as a new character) and yet all he does is shout. Loudly. Rinse and repeat. In fact, he shouts so damn loudly that I could barely hear what he's shouting about due to his accent. It seems that he's been told to act like a lunatic and he does just that. Unfortunately, it's too over the top to be believable and it totally ruins the whole film. Well, that's the start of 'Part III's' ruination.\n\nThen there's the gore. Or should I say 'lack of it?' Seriously, these film's selling points are that they gross you out. Most of us who invest our time into them are happy that there won't be a gripping and thought-provoking story with deep and emotional character development. We just want sickness. And we don't get it from Part III. It's just more of the same, only less graphic. We've seen it all before in the past two instalments and we've therefore seen it done better.\n\nIf you're as weird as me in that you actually enjoy watching films like this, stick to the first two. Ignore this one. It really is pretty bad. Or watch Kevin Smith's 'Tusk.' Even that was better and at least had some snappy dialogue added to the mix.\n\nPart III = avoid."

I was a fan of the first two just because of how twisted they were, and after hearing Six say that this was going to be the most gruesome yet, I was very eager to see it. What a disappointment.\n\nI made it through the first 17 minutes before I got incredibly irritated with Dieter Laser screaming all of his lines (seriously, everyone who's said that that's all he does is not lying. he LITERALLY screams ALL of his lines) and I started to just fast- forward to all of the gore/torture/death scenes to see what was in store. huge huge letdown. They're few and far between and they're total crap. There's little to no gore and they're very under- dramatic, if you consider that a thing. In my opinion, part of a good torture/death scene is the pain and suffering of the victim and there is just none of that. These people must have botched pain receptors.\n\nThis whole movie is a mess and a failure. I hate to say that because i really love Tom Six, but this should have never happened. It's like he spread the word that there would be a third movie and when it came time to start filming he was like \"damn, i really don't even feel like doing this anymore\" and he just let it go and let whatever happen. There probably wasn't even a solid script and everything was likely done in one take, whether it was satisfactory or not. Everyone involved just wanted it to be over. I hope to see another film come from the beautifully disturbed mind of Tom Six but for the love of god, please no more human centipedes."

Stars, and I say that with some sarcasm from the previous two films return as new characters in a top security United States prison somewhere in the desert. In that respect it is like a Carry On film. That is where the similarities end. Dieter Laser, the mad German doctor from part 1 is now Bill Boss, mad warden of the prison. He seems to have psychological issues and is very highly strung about being unable to control the prison population. The little guy from part 2 is the 'accountant' of the jail who comes up with the idea of a prison centipede to ultimately cut costs and control the population.\n\nThe film is very boring for large parts. Sick in others. Even the director/producer Tom Six presents himself in on screen cameos proud of his devious medically accurate claims. The film did not receive the same amount of pre-publicity regarding censor cuts than part 2 and is filmed in colour in this episode. That said I still would never recommend this filth."

I know, unfortunately, when you say that you do not watch the movie, or do not do it, you can see the worse person, but in this case, I'm sure after seeing the film I was talking about you saying that I would listen to it ...

It's okay, a brief summary of the film, for why I say I should not see the movie: The name of the thirty-sixth human film in which one human scientist hurts and savagely shoots it! Yes sweetie !!!!!! That's the name of the movie is a thousand pence! So that the first person is the first person in the mouth and the second hip in the third person's mouth and ...

So the third - and hopefully last - installment in the franchise didn't exactly have the cards dealt to it in its favor.\n\nThe cast in \"The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence\" was of somewhat a mixed handful. It was so bizarre to see cast from the first two movies in the franchise return to the movie, but in different roles. That just made for some very confusing associations. And Dieter Laser had a very peculiar way of acting and performing which seems comical and so out of tune, which added a distracting element to the atmosphere of the movie. Much of the time it was like watching a spoiled child trying to lash out in frustration and anger. Actually, it was very disruptive to the rest of the movie, because it was hard to take him serious in the movie. And just how they got the likes of Eric Roberts and Robert LaSardo to show up in a movie such as this was just beyond me.\n\nAt least the dialogue was very much in tune with the rest of the movie, being every bit as forced, ridiculous and weird. Most of it didn't really make much sense, and it didn't really help that most of it was delivered by a whacked out Dieter Laser. It should be said that there is some pretty hefty racial slurs, profane language and such being used in this movie, so do take that into consideration if you are easily offended by such foul language.\n\nThe characters were entirely weird and offbeat, especially most of the inmates in the prison. I mean, their behavior was just so strange that it would happen only in the movies.\n\nThere are some very graphic stuff taking place in the movie, and that might be upsetting to some viewers. But then again, going into watching a movie such as this, then you know what you are getting yourself into, of course. I am a seasoned horror and gore veteran, but even I was finding myself cringing at some of the scenes portrayed in this movie.\n\nNow, I don't really understand the idea or concept of putting the actual DVDs of the former two movies into this third movie. Sure, I get it that it was to present the idea that the events in this movie was based on the events taking place in those movies. But come on, that was just unfathomably cheesy, even for this franchise.\n\nIt was clear already in the second movie that director and writer Tom Six should have stopped with the completion of the first movie, because it has been a steady decline down a steep hill since then. And \"The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence\" didn't prove to improve on the franchise in any particular way.\n\nThis 2015 third installment into \"The Human Centipede\" franchise had a few moments of cringe-worthy visuals, but it was hardly a movie that stood apart from the previous two, and it didn't bring much of anything new to the franchise.\n\nI have seen it now, and color me unimpressed."

It also doesn't help that the two leads (Dieter Laser and Laurence Harvey return as new characters, because oh we're so freakin clever) are really struggling to get through this material. Laurence Harvey was actually pretty good in the second one, but he easily has the worst American accent I've ever heard. And I could barely understand Laser when he spoke slowly and with a normal voice, I sure as hell can't understand all his yelling in this one: I can't even make out when one word ends and the next one begins, let alone laugh at whatever his lines are. Oh, and the one actual clever idea Six had, the one he somehow based three movies around? The human centipede shows up long after you've given up, so the audience doesn't even get what it wants (is this...what we want?). The second one has its merits, forget about the rest."

The movie borderlines on parody but tries to be serious at times, both aspects fall completely flat. At least the other two films were somewhat set in reality, this one is comical to the point where the \"Governor\" and also the creator of the series both make cameos and the Governor is perfectly cool at the end with the human centipede and THE END. Literally as soon as the centipede is made the movie is over, anticlimactic isn't the word. Sometimes horror movies are so bad it's good but this is so bad it's just really bad. Skip this movie at all costs. This movie is just plain stupid"

I firmly believe, after seeing this film, that Tom Six should have some serious mental problem, and I am very sorry because I have never had anything against him personally. I sincerely hope that he will stop working at the movies and be very happy in any other profession.\n\nIf \"Human Centipede\" and the sequel that was inexplicably made afterwards were very bad movies, this movie set the record. Again, there is no real script here but a context and a cause. The context is the prison world and the cause is the madness and insanity of the guards and prison director who decide to build the \"centipede\" with hundreds of prisoners whom they think should be punished more severely. The mistakes continue, that \"medically accurate\" crap is no longer convincing and is clearly being used with sarcasm and the characters are deeply void.\n\nRepeating what I wrote for the second movie, I've never been a fan of gore movies, despite being an admirer of horror movies. Blood and fluids do not scare me, and I honestly do not feel like watching a movie if I suspect it's going to make me throw up my lunch. If I tried watching this movie it was just to be aware of the extent of the crap I already knew he had. I really hope it's the end of the centipedes."

Why would the boss act like he doesn't like Human Centipede when he is exactly the same character like the one we are seeing in the movies? So while this is a movie within a movie within a movie - it is rather juvenille than clever.\n\nThe director is a funny bloke and Dieter Laser is channeling him or his reactions to critics of his movies. Whatever the case, he relishes in everything thrown in his way, so me rating this 1/10 makes him happier than if I had gone 4 or 5. You're welcome Mr. Six! A nod to another critic (Ebert with a non score for the first Centipede, not the only movie that did not receive a rating by the way) is also part of the movie.\n\nSo again, you may find certain things funny (and he is inventive, if rather explicit and vile), but overall this never really does anything other than try to provoke the strongest possible reaction (laughing out loud or feeling the puke running through your veins). The casting is quite nicely - with quite a few familiar faces"

        "review_detailed_main": "Due to the baffling cult following the previous two films had garnered, the completion of a trilogy was inevitable. Of course the first two films where vile and had their fair share of shocking scenes, but this one...well this takes a whole new shape, and makes me question if Mr Six should be put in a straight jacket and thrown in the looney bin.\n\nThe first film was all about a disgraced surgeon and his delusional, yet accurate, curiosities about the medical possibilities of a human centipede. The horror that followed was all in relation to that initial idea.\n\nThe second was that of a fanatic and his urge to duplicate and elongate.\n\nThis however, boasts racism, sexism, barbarism. It is full of torture, gushing with grotesque analogies (those i could understand)and just a film full of hatred that has clearly been clogging Mr Six's disturbed mind. Yes, many of these topics have been highlighted in countless films, but in most, they have purpose or are handled with decency. There are scenes in this film that are quite simply horrific: Rape, Castration, kidney intrusion.It's perverted and verges on being inhuman. The prisoners are stereotyped in the most blatant way, in what people will describe as an attempt at humor is just an insight into how this directors mind works.\n\nBut worse than all of that, is the acting. Yes the most important part of a film. Dwight Butler (Played by \"Human Centipede II\"'s very own fanatic Laurence R Harvey) is horrific. His Texan accent is atrocious and he is made to look like a bald, bloated Hitler. He was slightly effective in the 2nd film because they played to his \"strengths\"; he was creepy and... well ....that's about it. Dieter Laser also comes back to the \"franchise\", now playing Bill Boss, the wicked warden. It is his acting that is the worst, i say again...the WORST acting i have ever seen. No exaggeration, this is abysmal. All he does is scream nonsensical, indescribable, psychobabble throughout. Be prepared to turn on the subtitles, because you'd have more chance breaking the enigma code than understanding what he is saying. I have to wonder if in the midst of twirling about acting like a complete imbecile, if he thought he was creating an acting masterpiece. Well folks, i can assure you he wasn't.\n\nAs for Tom Six, well i can only hope he is committed."

I got what I probably deserved - copious amounts of gore, an unfathomable story and some terrible, terrible acting.\n\nI was somewhat impressed with Dieter Laser's performance in the original film, but he is easily the most exasperating aspect of this one - he seems to have confused shouting and bawling at the top of his lungs with acting. What seems really saddest of all though is that he, his co-stars and director Tom Six - who makes the most self-aggrandising cameo in cinema history - seem to genuinely believe that they are making a seriously important work of art. In actual fact, Final Sequence is one of the most grotesque works of alleged art in recent memory."

        "review_detailed_main": "When The Human Centipede was released back in 2009, it became an instant talking point with both gore-hounds giddy at the prospect of such a repugnant idea actually making its way onto our screens, and those concerned with the idea of cinema reaching the very bottom of the barrel for the last dregs of bad taste. Of course, the result was nowhere near as horrific as many had thought. While it may have featured a scene of characters passing faeces directly from bottom to mouth, the whole thing was rather amusing, if ineptly made. Director Tom Six was keen to ensure that the hype wouldn't die down for the sequel, and did so by creating one of the vilest and most humourless shockers in horror history, and undoubtedly one of worst excuses for a movie ever made. It's a relief that humour has found its way back for part three, as is the presence of the word 'final' in its title. But that's where the positives end, as this is yet another button-pushing, attention-seeking vanity-project for Six.\n\nPsychopathic prison warden Bill Boss (Dieter Laser) rules over his inmates with an iron fist, punishing those that step out of line by breaking bones, removing testicles, and waterboarding with boiling water. With the violence spinning out of control, Governor Hughes (Eric Roberts) pays Boss a visit, informing the maniac that if he doesn't get a hold on things soon he will be fired and replaced. Having seen his brutal methods fail to bring the prisoners under control, Boss finally listens to his diminutive accountant Butler (Laurence R. Harvey) and his problem-solving idea. Armed with DVDs of The Human Centipede 1 and 2, Butler's scheme is to force the inmates to live out their sentences arse-to-mouth with their fellow incarcerates in one long, horrifying... well, you get the idea. With disgraced, struck-off prison doctor Jones (Clayton Rohner) on board in the hope of keeping his job, Boss and Butler even bring in Tom Six himself to discuss whether or not the director's claim of the procedure being 100% medically accurate is in fact correct.\n\nIt was admittedly an interesting move to make The Human Centipede 2 about a disturbed individual's reaction to seeing the first movie, but performing the same trick again simply reeks of narcissism, especially considering Six's decision to place himself within the narrative. While the second entry aimed to simply upset and disgust its audience with no trace of nuance, part three is all about the humour. Although rather than laughing, you'll be checking the running time to see how much you have left to endure. To Six, comedy is all about shouting, and Laser screams, rants and swears for the 100 minutes, stopping occasionally to munch on some dried clitorises imported from Africa or force his assistant Daisy (porn actress Bree Olson) to perform oral sex on him. Anyone voluntarily watching this film are here for one reason - to see the human centipede. It appears around the 85 minute mark, so there's a lot of arm-waving and general unpleasantness to get through before the big pay-off, which only appears on screen for about 5 minutes. I never thought I'd complain about the lack of poor souls being monstrously stitched together to form one grotesque digestive system, but that's The Human Centipede for you. Hopefully this series can now be laid to rest on the cinematic dung-pile."

Like the second film it is connected only by the human centipede theme. Very much in the style of a human centipede itself. Each 'segment' is unique but linked together with the other parts.\n\nPart 3 is brash, over-the-top, crazy, ludicrous, revolting and hilarious in equal measure. It's probably the most humorous of all the films with the dark comedy mixed in with almost theatrical farce. The film is a parody of itself with Tom Six giving the middle finger to those all thought the topic and subject matter of 1 and 2 was objectionable and 'should be banned'!\n\nPossibly the best thing about Part 3 is the performance of Dieter Laser from the first movie. His portrayal of psychotic prison warden Bill Boss is quite something. Almost exhausting to watch but gloriously offensive.\n\nChances are that you won't see anything quite this crazy on film for some time. Granted, it's not going to be to everyone's taste. I think you have to 'get' the humour of Tom Six to enjoy it but if you have seen the first two and enjoyed them then this is a must see."

Trying to combine the sex and horror genre with the prison genre failed.\n\nSo, this series has accomplished what few other film series have; going from bad to worse three times with a rating of 3 or less. One would be hard put to match that record. The lead actor was funny for five minutes or so, but then became cartoonish, as were all the other situations in the film.

This film is a middle finger to political correctness and, despite being the weakest entry in the film, it really succeeded well in that regard. Dieter Laser's brutally hateful character gets a ton of screen time, yelling at the top of his lungs at anyone, everyone and everything. Demanding castrations and eating the remains. It really doesn't leave anything to the imagination, and there are no lines or boundaries they aren't willing to cross. Laser (who played the evil doctor in the original), unfortunately, is a little bit too committed to this part, overacting to the point of being either satirical or unintelligible. It's the kind of thing you would watch to be able to say you've seen it (\"I watched every entry in the Human Centipede trilogy!\"), but not something you would ever put on for a casual Saturday afternoon viewing. Not something you would unwind to, and definitely not something you would watch for a date night or house party. I'm glad I watched it, but I couldn't recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well what can be said about the conclusion to a trilogy of horribly made dark comedies? It does stay true to the first two films as being completely devoid of any entertainment value.\n\nThis time the production quality far worse! Worse than the first two films? How bad could it really be? I'll sum up the production quality this way, it's the worst I've ever seen for a Bree Olsen film! Yeah, that's bad!\n\nI've actually heard some defense of Tom Six's film making as being \"realistic\" and \"gritty.\" NO! It's just lazy. If the director doesn't care about the camera being in focus, the set being lit, off set noises remaining on the soundtrack, or actors missing their lines and not doing a second take it's just lazy. It shows the director doesn't care and the audience will respond in kind.\n\nDieter Laser returns in the lead as a Southern prison warden. A German actor doing a bad Southern accent fails for laughs on every level. NONE OF THE ATTEMPTED HUMOR works on any level!!! And this is 75% of the movie, Dieter Laser acting like Boss Hogg.\n\nThe other 25% are attempted gross out scenes of prisoners being raped in their kidney's and the cannibalization of human testicles. True to the first two films this gore is just plain silly rather than disgusting or morbidly humorous.\n\nSo what does any of this have to do with the human centipede? As the poster reveals, the warden concludes that the best way to maintain order in the prison is to create one giant human centipede. He gets his inspiration from watching.... 'The Human Centipede.' Because a movie within a movie worked so well in the second film.\n\nHence the few brief moments of the human centipede are only seen in the climax, which you could have gotten by just looking at the poster.\n\nSo if you're having any morbid curiosity of seeing this film. Don't!"

Less than 30 minutes in and I'd already thrown up! The acting was atrocious and the storyline was even worse. Genuinely struggled to watch the film it was that bad! I seriously wonder where people come up with these ideas, and how it's made over 16 thousand pounds in the box office absolutely baffles my mind. Makes me wonder what the budget was! I cannot even put into words how bad this film is. The fake American accents were diabolical and the whole idea is ridiculous! I would love to meet the director to ask him what is wrong with him! I think I would actually rather sit and watch paint dry! 1hr 45mins I am never going to get back!!"

Dieter Laser is not bad in the role of sadistic prison director, the only thing is he's repeating himself in all forms, gestures, facial expressions, would have been much better if they had made an effort, together with Mr. Six, to exploit more of the comic scenes and situations."

        "review_detailed_main": "I personally liked the flair of the first Human Centipede movie the most. The sequel was not really my cup of tea but this particular movie took me by surprise. It wasn't really \"scary\" in the traditional sense that is classically associated with the Horror genre but it was really entertaining in its own special way. If you have a twisted sense of humor this movie is going to have you rolling on the floor laughing. It was literally one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I just couldn't stop laughing: The whole movie was basically a succession of clever jokes that were occasionally interrupted by a couple of nasty and gross torture scenes.\n\nConclusion: this movie isn't really part of the continuity that the first two movies shared but rather a movie that's supposed to be a grand finale.\n\nThe first movie was pretty much a thriller and had you rooting for the people who fell victim to Dr. Heiter's insane experiment. The sequel was just messed up and featured mental abuse as well as self- mutilation. All in one it was very disgusting on all levels possible. The third installment of the franchise however is in my opinion a well thought out comedic take on the prequels. Furthermore Tom Six (the director) had a cameo appearance which made for some good meta- jokes. Something that is rarely seen on screen these days. It suffices to say that I liked it very much. If you have a dark sense of humor, as do I, you'll love it, too."

        "review_detailed_main": "I expected a terrible movie; torture porn....something akin to the last few saw movies or CGI sci-fi channel crap which has ruined the horror genre for the last decade plus.\n\nWOAH. Was i surprised by this one; I enjoyed human centipede1 for simply the train wreck of it all, but felt it wasn't that entertaining and certainly horrible in terms of its acting outside of Dieter Laser. But more about him, in a few...\n\nThis movie was the most enjoyable movie i've seen this year; no joke. I laughed from the first moment; I sensed that Tom Sixx was trying to make political statements with this film, and he did, and that he had to go over the top to be poignant, was appreciated.\n\nDieter Laser, who is in his 70s(!) and plays the racist sadistic sheriff, is absolutely riveting. I simply cannot believe how great and BRAVE of a performance he gives in this film. From interviews on you tube, where many (speculate that Dieter is also vile) you get a sense that he poured his soul into this role, and all the passive aggressive feelings he had about Nazis from his youth seeps thru in this role. One cannot see him in this role, and not be reminded of the third Reich, and what it takes to simply have no humanity. Tom sixx does not shy away from showing the very real sexual deviancy connected to how we seek punishment. Also, Dieter Laser reminds me of sheriff joe from my state of arizona. Its uncanny, especially the ego and bravado by which he devours everything around him like the snake he imagined when playing this role (more info discovered from his interviews on you tube.) That is why he wears snake cowboy boots; its a nod to the animal he used as homage to his performance via his method acting.\n\nIf you go into this movie hoping for loud techno, and boobies, and one liners, and feeling good for some hero to rise up and triumph...thats not this movie. If you want to watch perhaps the blackest comedy i've seen in many years, which is also a mirror imo for our culture and the joy we take in the torture of prisoners... well... this is your movie.\n\nI still can't believe how much i like it. cheers world"

I would have preferred to see Bree Olson's character's labia cut, boiled and eaten and the testicles on the plate fully masticated.\n\nThe joke is on American audiences if they think the director is sick or this is a new cultural low. United States of America's morals and cultural attitudes are indicted here by a genius director and it's a dark satire that Stanley Kubrick would be rising in his grave if he could see it. The incessant yelling, racism, violence, sexual depravity is all a major part of American society, this movie is extremely relevant. This makes Dr. Strangelove seem like a 1930s silent film."

How anyone can really knock a film with porno cutie Bree Olson playing a hot secretary is beyond me, but in a 'mainstream' role, she's really good.\n\nSet in a maximum security prison in a boiling hot southern state, a crazy governor and his loyal assistant create the ultimate deterrent!\n\nIf I ran the world, I would do this to the worst criminals, the Guantanamo inmates would REALLY have something to complain about.\n\nIf you like movies to be bold and fun, this is the film for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I disliked the first human centipede film. It was not funny enough or graphic enough so it was in a Gory area. The 2nd film was amazing! Well,not like \"Citizen Kane\" amazing LOL. I found the absence of color and no dialogue from the main character to be interesting choices for Tom six to make. It was very very graphic though and i found myself enjoying the tamer scenes of for instance Martin sitting at the dinner table as his mother verbally abuses him and finding out what made him into a psychopath as opposed to the scenes of him putting barb wire around his penis and having sex with the unfortunate girl at the end of the centipede. Anyway,I would give the 2nd film an 8/10. Now, onto the 3rd film. The film stars the 2 doctors from the previous films playing different characters. The doctor from the first film is the warden of a prison where he is struggling to maintain order. The doctor from the 2nd film proposes the idea of making a human centipede from all the prisoners to teach them a lesson. The film has sort of an exaggerated color scheme which i found to be appealing although some have complained it looked \"cheap\". I didn't find the main characters to be annoying as others did either. It was a good blend of horror gore and comedy in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "How many franchises can you say managed to realize their potential and hit the nail on the head with their third and, in this case, final film? The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) is the only example I can think of, as it works off of two contemptible predecessors that did nothing but squander such a grotesque but devilishly intriguing premise. While the first film ran out of gas after about thirty minutes, and the second, despite attractive, saturated black and white cinematography, found itself nothing more than a tired array of vignettes bearing shock value, the third film takes a more slowburn, structured approach to the concept of a human centipede. It relies on character development, commentary, and a cross between the disgusting and the humorous to make a film that exploits its concept for just about the last ounce of energy its able to muster before we conclude one of film's most perplexing trilogies.\n\nOpening by showing the end credits to The Human Centipede II, in a manner to how that film opened, we find ourselves inside a prison complex run by Bill Boss (Dieter Laser). Boss is a loud, domineering, and unbelievably miserable guard, demanding respect from his inmates who, in turn, return nothing but the same hatred he shows to them. Alongside Boss is Dwight Butler (Laurence R. Harvey), his chubby and more level-headed accountant, who usually supplies him with the brains he's lacking, and Daisy (Bree Olson), his secretary who also serves as his sex slave.\n\nBoss spends most of his days making life a living hell for the inmates who disrespect him at every turn, and it isn't until Governor Hughes (Eric Roberts) visits the prison and orders a cleaner, more humane atmosphere does Boss realize he may need to straighten himself and the prison up. With that, Dwight, in the mix of his fascination with the first two Human Centipede films, suggests to Boss that, in order to create a less violent atmosphere and discourage crime all together, the two of them could hire surgeons to create one long, five-hundred person human centipede out of the inmates at the prison. Boss loves the idea and immediately gets to work, even going as far as hiring Tom Six, the real-life director of The Human Centipede films, to offer his own personal input.\n\nLaser gives his most intense and hilarious performance to date, going absolutely over-the-top with his role, making his \"mad doctor\" performance in the first film seem minimalistic in comparison. Laser is a force of nature in this film, constantly yelling or looking as if the veins in his skull are about to rupture, making for a performance of true power and conviction throughout the entire film. Harvey, in addition, creates another character that is interesting by his very nature, only this time, he's given more of a developed role than what was seen in the second film. Together, the two form a sick, twisted, but often very amusing, duo that impress in nearly every scene.\n\nWhat The Human Centipede III achieves that the previous two installments couldn't bother to muster is some resemblance of narrative order rather than capping out on senseless shock value or running their own premises dry. Six takes more of a slowburn approach to the story here, allowing us, the audience, to explore the prison environment with Boss and Dwight, and find ourselves inside an environment rather than being onlookers or observers into it. Despite numerous situations being disgusting, the film, like its predecessors, is remarkable in how grounded and professional it remains in look and feel. These films do not feel like low-budget, low-grade cheapies, but bear a distinctly clean, accomplished look that some medium/high-budget horror films can't normally achieve.\n\nBut most importantly, the fact that The Human Centipede III takes story, character, and even societal commentary about the prison system and institutional punishment all into consideration makes it a more enjoyable film rather than a sick exercise in depravity. This is a film one can actually enjoy as a film rather than being mystified at the shock value behind the idea. There's more to appreciate about Six's craft and the talent of Laser and Harvey that surfaces because of the care and attention brought to the forefront here.\n\nI'm sure many who will read this review will roll their eyes in confusion and disbelief. In my opinion, that's one of the milder reactions one could have to this film and a positive review of it. But it's important to recognize the series's original roots and how it has evolved with its final installment. I've long held the belief that a good film can be made from just about any, if not all, premises under the sun and Human Centipede III only makes me affirm that belief. It came from being shock that couldn't sustain an entire film and shock value that only grew more and more tiresome when built upon continuously to something truly worth remembering and praising. The Human Centipede, with its third and final film, surpasses the stigma of its gut-turning idea and becomes a realized and convincing story; it's the definition of a series that ended just as it was getting going.\n\nStarring: Dieter Laser, Laurence R. Harvey, Bree Olson, and Eric Roberts. Directed by: Tom Six."
