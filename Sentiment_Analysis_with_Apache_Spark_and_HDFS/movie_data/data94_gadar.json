        "review_title": "A fast-paced, highly entertaining action-packed romance",
        "review_detailed_main": "Indeed, Gadar is pulp history, and it's not the best picture in its presentation of the warring sides. Set during the 1947 India-Pakistan Partition, the film tells the love story between Tara Singh, a Sikh truck driver, and Sakina, a girl coming from an aristocratic Muslim family. The film presents the atrocities of war during Partition, with particular emphasis on the Punjab riots, where Hindus and Muslims kill each other on each group's migration to their destined country (India/Pakistan). Tara, aiming to kill Muslims, is shocked to find Sakina, whom he used to know years before Partition. He takes her under his protection and gives her shelter in gratitude of her kindness to him before.\n\nGadar is not a historical film, but it's quite a remarkable epic film in its extraordinary entertainment value. The film is thoroughly watchable and interesting, and it keeps the viewers (well it kept me, for sure) on the edge of their seats for its entire duration. The proceedings move at a fast pace, and even more so as the story unfolds. The romantic portions are beautiful and actually quite subtly done (note the scene where Sakeena helps Tara wear his turban, or the scene where she confesses to him - wonderful). The action that follows is excellent, and their escape later on is one of the most thrilling, entertaining and well-shot sequences of its kind.\n\nThe production values in this regard are fantastic. The sets and costumes are excellently chosen to create the desired atmosphere of that era. The film's huge tonal shift from brutal riots to pure romance and marital bliss to action-packed thriller makes the entire experience into quite an exhilarating rollercoaster ride. The traditional music is wonderful, and Uttam Singh can always be counted on to deliver beautiful melodies. Yes, some of the later parts get overblown both emotionally and in terms of the portrayal of the animosity between the two sides which is really a little childish and hard to believe, but it's a movie, and it's all within the context of a mainstream Hindi film.\n\nSunny Deol is tremendous in the lead role. I've liked him ever since his debut back in 1983 with Betaab, and here he gives a passionate, intense performance both in the early portions where he brilliantly plays Tara's innocent shyness and wholesome personality and in the later parts where he turns into the fierce action star he is known to be. His leading lady, Amisha Patel is luminous in a beautiful performance that remains her best work to this day. I wish she made more use of her tremendous potential. Amrish Puri is excellent because he always is although his part veers into caricature, and Lillete Dubey is very good, too. Tu sum it up, Gadar is a true cinematic experience fulfilling exactly what cinema is all about in the end: entertainment. There's plenty of it here."

        "review_detailed_main": "If there is one movie that I would pick as one of the best movies that the Indian Film Industry has produced, it has to be-\"Gadar-Ek Prem Katha.\" It is very sweeping statement to make, but I make it with conviction. The best movies are either fiction (Shawshank Redemption,) or portrayal of an event that left indelible scars and memories that is left for generations to cope. There were two people who put this masterpiece of a movie together, Anil Sharma and Nitin Keni, not necessarily popular names like Satyajit Ray and Raj Kapoor, but the sheer brilliance of the production, the reconstruction of the authenticity of the period, reminds me of David Lean production. It is difficult to relive part of the history that should be long forgotten, but to recreate this history is the genius of the director, in this case Anil Sharma. Sunny Deol, as (Tara Singh) is a performance of a life time for this actor whose talent has been under estimated and then we have Non Indian and idiot actors like Aamir Khan have been over estimated and put on a pedestal by morons of Mumbai media and these imbeciles for a cup of garam chai will worship anyone like pied pipers. Very few (Hrithik Roshan, Abishek Bachchan) can portray the raw emotions and bring a certain velocity to the character as Sunny Deol does here. He is matched by another thespian Amrish Puri, who is just an \"Volcano\" of talent. A new comer by the name of Amisha Patel, who gives a soulful, sobbing, stellar performance. She has subtlety and depth to her gaze and a femininity of emotion she brings to this character. Over-all, this is a masterpiece, that will be tough to be outdone."

Brilliant work by rest of the starcast too including Ameesha patel,Vivek Shauq,Lillete Dubey and above all Amrish Puri. And what to say about the massive craze of this movie outside cinema halls all over the India when it was released on 15th june 2001.No dabang or 3 idiots can come even near the shadow of Gadar's poularity.I still remember when i watched movie ,it was a housefull show in PARAS cinema,Kurukshetra even on the 50th day after the release and audience reaction whenever Sunny Deol uttered any dialogue,Absolutely matchless. Gadar is a landmark fim in the history of Indian cinema in terms of gross collection when adjusted to inflation. Yes It is superior to 3 idiots,ETT, Dabang etc.Its has footfalls of more than 4 crores, which is a record till date."

Watch this action movie with an open mind, and you will realize the realistic bravery and power that he exudes on the silver screen. Only Sunny Deol could pull this one off with total \u00e9lan. This is a novel plot (based on the painful partition after independence in the late 40's). It looks so realistic to the point that no other current hero could have aced this role like Sunny Deol did. It is NOT aimed at running down Pakistan because Sunny Deol's Sardarji character is married to a Pakistani girl after he saves her from attacks as he believes in humanity. All he wants to do is keep his family together as one. Sunny Deol brilliantly fights hard to save the day and cow down his in-laws. People should understand that like his dad, Dharmendra, Sunny Deol has that fire, intensity, and command (unlike that overrated SRK)! Anyways, watch this and enjoy it! 12/10!"

The songs were boring and ain't the kind of song you want to listen to in your car, full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for making daft movies, where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own. He even kicks a metal jail door (Indian) and kicks a moving car far away (Teesri Aankh). I can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people know this already. Sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role. A guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece, by using violence. Amisha Patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone. But even she couldn't save the film from being a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does, in this movie she doesn't. Maybe cos she was playing a Muslim, but she doesn't act like one in the movie. Overall, this is a poor show all the way, I'm sure it will appeal to some people, who love seeing the Bollywood actor beat up 100 guys. Give me a break."

During such desperate times, a brave sanatani sikh protected the daughter of a muslim traitor who betrayed India and left to Pakistan- once from rioters and second time from her own fanatic father. The film depicts the superiority of values of Sanatana Dharma and is full of emotions: patriotism, romance, bravery, deceit and jihadi fanaticism. A footfall of 4 crore in cinemas for the movie speakes volumes. Very nice action, amazing loyalty between husband and wife.. The dialogues leave a deep impact on both sides of the border.

It has period elements, historical events, romance, drama, & screen faad action. Beautiful. Saw this again today in a multiplex, sp rerun, to a housefull audience and again, the environment was electric. This film has stood the test of time and is one of the greatest Bollywood film ever produced."

Vivek Shaq as Darmiyaan and the dialogues that this film has needs a special mention. It's true to the the times but the story will always be evergreen so.

The movie not only shows brief history about what exactly occurred, but also has an element of romance and love. Sunny Deoul is one of my favorite actors, and he is pretty good in this movie. One of the reason I watched this movie was because I was very interested about the history behind the separation of Pakistan from India. Although I will need to watch some documentaries to get an accurate picture, this movie showed the brutalities and struggles that occurred. In conclusion, if you like romantic films (as all bollywood movies are), this is a great movie. I would also recommend watching kabhi khushi kabhi gum."

Brilliant work by rest of the starcast too including Ameesha patel,Vivek Shauq,Lillete Dubey and above all Amrish Puri. And what to say about the massive craze of this movie outside cinema halls all over the India when it was released on 15th june 2001. No dabang or 3 idiots can come even near the shadow of Gadar's poularity. I still remember when i watched movie ,it was a housefull show in PARAS cinema,Kurukshetra even on the 50th day after the release and audience reaction whenever Sunny Deol."

Amisha Patel is IMHO a weak actress, she more irritates than impresses. When she is supposed to show emotions, she stays blank with an open mouth. And crying scenes, especially during the phone conversation with a mom, is overexaggerated, by both a mom and a daughter. Instead of being touching, this weeping is irritating. Just IMHO.\n\nOtherwise, a very good story and interesting movie. 9/10."

A humble truck driver who falls in love with a noble lady, Sakeena Ali played by Ameesha Patel. The story takes place in the context of India's independence.\n\nThe music acts as a harmonious accompaniment of emotions that are being depicted on the screen. Perhaps the most memorable piece of music is the one that Tara played when he first met Sakeena. A timeless classic that is still captivating to this day.\n\nThe story gets all the more intriguing with the involvement of its antagonist, Late Amrish Puri.\n\nThe story gets a new depth with the conflict between Mr. Amrish Puri and Tara Singh.\n\nYou'd wonder to yourself how will that differences be resolved?\n\nMaybe, the greatest test of the human relationship with his fellow man could be resolved with love and kindness.\n\nThe ending had a satisfying conclusion.\n\nAnil Sharma's direction and story by Shaktimaan Talwar work exceptionally well in terms of story structure. The action scenes are spectacular and well-choreographed by Tinnu Verma.\n\nI've had an amazing experience watching this movie!\n\nIt's definitely a wholesome experience!\n\nThe movie was released in 2001 and considering it over two decades old, it is still enjoyable to watch to this day."
