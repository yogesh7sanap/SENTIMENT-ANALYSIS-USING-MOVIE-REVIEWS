        "review_detailed_main": "A pair of Great White sharks attack Sea World in Florida.\n\nJaws 3-D is a mostly weak film but has the redeeming quality of presenting such an outrageous concept you cannot help but watch it unfold. Additionally, it's artistic and technical merits are quite enjoyably flawed.\n\nJaws 2 was an unnecessary yet well made sequel, but having members of Brody family face yet another \"murderer\" shark is a laughably daft concept. Rather disturbingly it continued a trend of movies that demonise sharks. There are numerous other ideas involving the behaviour of sharks/dolphins and reactions of the main characters that are equally as bizarre, but if you can switch the brain off and appreciate their entertainment value you might find it a worthwhile investment of time. It also contains recycled character arcs from the original movie that feel like pale imitations.\n\nTechnically it has problems, particularly when most viewers will not get the chance to see the theatrical release. Most visuals designed for a 3-D experience stand out and do not have the same impact.\n\nThe shark horror sequences have little build up or tension and are quite unconvincing. I do admire the ambition of attempting to create a victim's perspective sequence from the inside of its mouth, but most of the final scenes of painfully slow moving underwater horror, (particularly the moment in the control room) are incredibly ropey.\n\nThat's not to say that the classic original did not (in principle) have the same problems. A mechanical shark looks like nothing else in every Jaws movie. However, Spielberg understood this and wisely kept the shark mostly hidden and focussed on developing great characters and tension.\n\nI feel sorry for the editor of this sequel as it appears they had to cut together footage from both above and below the sea level that make the water's depth and lighting conditions look very inconsistent.\n\nFor some balance I am positive about the performances. Most actors do their best with dodgy material. Louis Gossett Jr, Bess Armstrong, and the coked up Dennis Quaid standout. Lea Thompson has some memorable moments as the \"professional water skier\". It feels the direction was more focussed on making the cast look good in shorts and swimsuits than character portrayals, but they manage to elevate some scenes. Armstrong convinces me as a whale/dolphin wrangler and I think she is the strongest performer.\n\nAs a young child of the 80s I quite enjoyed it on VHS. On a recent rewatch I placed it in the genre: so bad it's good, and sub-genre: never rewatch and spoil that of which you have fond childhood memories."

        "review_detailed_main": "Saw this one in all its 3D glory in the theater back in 1983, and it really scared the heck out of me. (I was ten) This film furthers the saga of the Brody family as sons Sean and Mike are now fully grown and moved away from Amity Island. Sean does something in Colorado if I recall, and Mike is (heh, heh, heh,) an underwater welder who just finished construction of an undersea kingdom at Sea World in Florida. Just when the park is about to have a grand opening, some uninvited guests show up. They being a 35-foot great white shark and her offspring. Needless to say, some people get eaten.\n\nThis film was originally going to be made as spoof of the previous two films. I'm not sure if any type of a finished script to that effect exists, but it would be worth a look. Jaws 3D ends up being another serious monster movie with a disaster movie subplot. Not only does the shark eat a bunch of people, it also traps several others in the underwater part of the park. The race is on to save the people and kill the mother shark. Her baby dies midway through after it is captured and hastily put on display in the park. The conclusion is fairly exciting, and full of bloody carnage.\n\nThe cast is one of the stronger points of the film. Dennis Quaid is the fearless Mike Brody. Bess Armstrong plays the park's head biologist and Quaid's love interest. (The real sparks were apparently flying between Quaid and Lea Thompson off camera, though!) Thompson plays a water skier at the park, and John Putch plays Sean Brody who falls for her. Simon MacCorkindale and P.H. Moriarity play a couple of Englishmen who show up and help battle the sharks. By far the best performance is turned in by Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. He plays the owner/manager/president (I'm really not sure which) of the park. He has a terrific moment as he addresses the park guests in the underwater tunnels over the p.a. system. He turns on the fake executive public relations charm and asks them all to calmly exit the park just as the giant shark is bearing down on them.\n\nThe individuals who play Dan and Liz left a lot to be desired. Since no other film credits are listed for them, one would have to conclude that they actually worked at Sea World and were given these roles since this is what they do on a daily basis. Maybe they still work there. Anyone know? The sharks look pretty good in most of the scenes. Except at the very end when the shark is lodged into the control room and its tail is sticking out. That looked incredibly fake. In addition, sharks must always stay moving in the water or they'll die. They can't just lay low in huge underwater structures waiting to pounce on their victims. They usually strike from directly underneath their victims in most attack scenarios. The big shark in this film also has the ability to growl and roar, but not as loudly as the one in part IV! The 3D effect looked very good in the theater, but films like this lose quite a bit of their luster on the TV screen. You're only left with a bunch of gag shots that were supposed to scare viewers in the theater, but now look ludicrous and forced.\n\nThis film made some pretty decent $ in its theatrical run, and is still shown regularly on television. If nothing else is on, and you find yourself in front of a TV for an extended period, give this film a try. But be forewarned: Part IV is perhaps the worst film ever made. Don't waste your time on that one! 5 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Great White goes back into the cinema in this flawed sequel.This bone-chilling movie based on the Peter Benchley's novel and written by Richard Matheson and Carl Gottlieb (screenwriter of the trilogy) , it packs some exciting scenes, thrills, chills and lousy direction. The film is developed at Florida in a seaside park , while the previous entries are set at in New England in a shore community named Amity .There ,people is terrorized by a giant shark that attacks pacific tourists at the undersea kingdom during the preview week. An underwater world that contains restaurant, cafeteria, aquarium and several other things.The sons ( Dennis Quaid and John Putch) of Police chief Brody ( Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary Jaws I,II) attempt to convince the park owner (Louis Gossett Jr) who reluctantly listen them to close the attraction . Meanwhile the giant shark attacks and the victims run afoul and making a real carnage and those serving for lunch. Then, an adventurer named Phillip(Simon MacCorkindale) and his helper determine to track down and kill it. The protagonists are forced to fight for their lives in a mortal confrontation.\n\nIt's an inferior following with average creation of tension,thrills,terror, emotions and brief gore. The story gets little relation to first two Jaws, except by father Sheriff Brody and sons relationship. The argument of this gratuitous following is partially similar to \u00a8Revenge of the creature\u00a8(Jack Arnold) in which also a monster terrorizes a sea park. The shark attack images deliver the exciting united to creepy score composed and conducted by Alan Parker inspired on the classic soundtrack by the master John Williams (prized with an Oscar) who heightens the suspense. This below average movie features lousy interpretations of the quintet main star, Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr, John Putch and Lea Thompson (formerly to \u00a8Back to the future\u00a8) . Regular cinematography by James A Contner (subsequently filmmaker) and is badly directed by Joe Alves, producer designer of the original film. While the classic picture by Spielberg obtained three Oscars well deserved and today considered an authentic classic, its tree sequels are much worst, and were respectively directed by Jeannot Swarc,Joe Alves and Joseph Sargent in annoying direction. Rating: Bottom of barrel, a real turkey. Only for theaters, its real asset are the 3D digital effects, for that reason in television lost their spectacular Tri-dimensional qualities."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm certain if you read the screenplay for this third entry in the Jaws franchise you'd think it could amount to a solid sequel. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, it at least adds many new elements to the Jaws formula. Where it all goes wrong is in the execution. The acting, direction, and production values are way, way below what they should have been. The 3-D effects are ridiculous. They bring to mind a SCTV parody of 3-D films, with exaggerated tricks that add nothing to someone watching this in regular format. Compare this to something like The Creature From The Black Lagoon, or It Came From Outer Space- those films were 3-D but play perfectly well as flat films. But those were made by people with talent, this film is not.\n\nThere's also the weird idea of using the Sea World park, but making it a fictitious one located near the ocean with completely different attractions- it's a strange bit of promotional advertising. The real Sea World is quite different, and yet it's shown with all these fantastic elements that are pure fantasy. A better idea would have been to name the marine attraction something original. The scenes somehow come off way more corny and trite than the actual theme park was at the time. The use of the dolphins is a great idea that is staged horribly. The old Flipper show had better shark vs. dolphin scenes.\n\nThe effects are wretched. In fact, had they worked it would have helped save the whole film from being a waste, but they are totally amateurish, below that of a Roger Corman exploitation film from the 50s or 60s. One expects more from a major studio mounting a sequel to a mega-hit.\n\nThe actors offer nothing here. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gosset have shown remarkable talent, but none of it is on display here. Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson are both very attractive, but again they don't really add anything, and Thompson seems especially vapid here. Luckily all these actors are in a film so filled with incompetence that the music, effects, editing and overall storytelling distract from their work."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, the movie fails mainly due to the 3D effects (sorry for my English, I'm a Spaniard!) 'cause they wanna be more than they're. Sometimes, they look laughable, but the physical effects are awesome (the great great white). I appreciate this movie 'cause this is a movie of my childhood. I saw and recorded it on TV, and I grew with Mike and Kathryn, my right heroes!!!.\n\nNow, I'm conscious about the film's mistakes, but, for a third installment, the result ins't so bad. The plot couldn't innovate the genre, but the idea of a baby shark and his angry mother is... so childish and imaginative. Otherwise the idea of a shark attack in a aquatic park is fabulous. I think that if they made this movie without the 3D effect it looked better. Sometimes, the scales don't agree, and the \"lake\" looks deeper than it is, for example. The ending, with the mother breaking the control room's glass is... funny (and ridiculous) ...\n\nThe characters are well performed, but I saw this film on the Spanish version, so the \"dubbing actors\" could act better than the original actors. Because of that, I don't understand why Louis Gosset Jr. was nominated for a Razzie award \u00bf?. The relationship of Mike-Kathryn and Sean-Kelly are convincing.\n\nThis movie is far for being the worst of the series. it's clearly weaker than the first ones, but...worthy and entertaining. If the effects weren't 3D, the movie was totally fabulous. But, furthermore there was the 80s. It doesn't look so bad for being 80s. Isn't it?"

When the film hit the video shelves, they scrapped the whole thing. Why make a 3-D movie in the first place if you're not going to take advantage of it when it's available for the home video market? The video looked bad when it was released as a rental. Many of the scenes that were shot didn't make any sense or were badly projected. The movie did poorly at the box office and after a couple of years, no more mainstream films were presented in 3-D. The movie itself is pretty bad. Only for die hard fans of the JAWS series.\n\nNot recommended, unless they re-release it in 3-D. other than that it's pretty much worthless."

The film definitely misses Roy Schneider who was the focal character (apart from the Shark of course.)\n\nIt's definitely better then Jaws The Revenge which is an absolute waste of time. In shark terms this film would be a Basking Shark, it certainly lacks any bite of any kind. It's a film you watch for a bit of fun, it's hard to take this one seriously. 4/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is Jaws' second sequel, which I think is the best of the three following the original movie. The sons of Roy Scheider's Chief Brody character, Mike and Sean, take center stage. Mike and girlfriend Kathryn Morgan are marine biologists at a Seaworld theme park. They discover a baby shark, which happened to be trapped inside the park, and later perishes. To their surprise, the scientists also discover that its 35-foot mother, a huge Great-White shark, is also trapped inside and is hungry; therefore, they try to evacuate Seaworld before any casualties strike.\n\nThe special effects were bit of a downgrade from the first two movies, with the shark's execution being less realistic and horrific; in some scenes, you could hear the animatronics and machinery that the crew used to operate the animal. Alan Parker did a fine job on the music score, I think, and also incorporated John Williams' famous shark theme.\n\nWhile this film was pretty much slammed by many critics and viewers, even garnering several Razzie Award nominations, I actually thought the movie was exciting and more fun to watch than Jaws II. Having the setting inside a water theme park rather than the usual beaches in a small town is a neat idea, and seeing the Seaworld workers reacting to the idea that a huge Great White is inside the park, where thousands of visitors are, and trying desperately to find a plan to evacuate the park and capture the shark is suspenseful. The acting is descent and plot is fast-paced. Director Joe Alves did a pretty good job making the movie.\n\nThere are more surprises and thrilling moments, I think, than in the previous movie. My favorite scene is the part where the Great White swims toward the viewing glass from the park's control room, puncturing the glass, letting water rush in and sending every person inside swimming for their lives.\n\nOverall, Jaws III doesn't match the original film in fright and shock value, but is what I think the better of the three sequels.\n\nGrade B"

This one focuses on the Brodie boys who really went through a growth spurt. One (Dennis Quaid) works at a sea amusement park and this is where the shark attacks take place (this should alone tell you not to take the film to seriously). I actually saw this one at the theater too, so that helps to enjoy the film more as it was rather cool in 3-D and it is the only 3-D movie I have ever seen at the theater so maybe that is why I will always somewhat enjoy it. The plot is at a sea park like I said and first the team goes after this one shark that was rather puny, then you find out there is a bigger one out there. There are a couple of pretty good shark attack scenes and I loved the subplot of the people stuck in that pod underwater. This film isn't for everyone though seeing as how it is ranked as one of the worst so read other people's reviews before deciding to see it."

All in all, a hilarious movie. I wouldn't have believed that it was possible for anyone to make such a bad movie in this day and age.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I began watching \"Jaws 3-D\" I had to laugh. According to IMDB and the film itself, it was filmed at Sea World in Orlando. Well, Orlando is about 90 minutes from the ocean....and there is no way ANY shark could attack there as there are only lakes around the property. I am sure that a lot of other Floridians had to laugh at this as well.\n\nThe first portion of \"Jaws 3-D\" wasn't that bad. Sure, there were some cheap 3-D tricks reminscent of \"SCTV\" and their 'Dr. Tongue' skits....but the story wasn't too stupid. However as the film progressed, the 3-D stunts got worse as did the horrid underwater sequences and, especially, the plot. We are to believe that a 35 foot Great White shark is angry because its baby was killed (sharks have zero maternal instinct by the way) and it attacks and destroys much of an underwater sea park...and, it growls!! The premise is ridiculous and the whole thing is carried off in the crappiest possible way. For examples, as people are supposedly walking around in tunnels under the sea, it's obvious that the external shots were sloppily added later....and when you see subs and other things under the water, it's obvious they were done using a green screen and VERY poorly added later. On the big screeen this must have been paritcularly jarring to watch! As for the shark itself, despite nearly a decade between this film and the original \"Jaws\", the shark manages to look even LESS lifelike! This is especially true in the ultra-slow motion scene towards the end when it smashes the control room...and ultimately meets its doom. You just have to see it to believe it!!\n\nOverall, a dopey movie with abominable special effects. One positive thing, however, about the film...it proves that acting in such a movie will NOT necessarily kill your career or your reputation. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, for example, managed to make this pile of crap and still have some self-respect. Strangely, despite all its many deficiencies...the movie still managed to make money!!\n\nIf you didn't know, this movie is currently #60 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. I can how it made it, as the list consists of the worst major releases and even after 36 years, folks STILL remember it and hate it. A terrible film."

To me, the jaw is more scary in this third part then in the first part for example. You can nicely see his body and its just scary to see how big he is. The plot is also very interesting, about a water park that opens his doors for the first time with some nice people working their that gives the movie a lot of fun times to watch. No stupid characters and some moments are really good like when the shark attacks some of the underwater parts of the park or when the dolphins helps the people fight the jaw. Very nice movie."

It's mostly just humans... doing stuff. When the shark shows up, you're like \"Wow! There's a shark in this movie?\", since it's basically a Sea World training video featuring Jaws. The ending is pretty random. Okay, so Mike and his girl make it out okay, and what's the first thing on their mind? The dolphins! Are you serious? The dolphins? That's your main concern? How about wondering if your friends are still alive? Before I go, I'd like to say that the scene where the shark comes towards the workers probably looked cool in 3-D, but when you view it on the movie's 2-D home video release, it just looks silly."

There may be lots of floors but it is a good movie so overall I would think that this movie may be stupid but it does not deserve the extremely low rating and low respect to it.

The film used the best technology available to put you right in the movie. Dennis Quaid, Louis Gossett Jr., and the other actors did a fine job.

The shark made in this looks like a piece of cardboard that floats through the water, they copied the original score from the first jaws film and if it wasn't for a brody descendant and the score this could've been named something else. It looked so damn fake when the shark went through the glass at the end of this ridiculously bad film. Even Dennis quaid did a bad job in this one, if they kept Roy Schneider it would be worth watching. I only gave this a two because it was suspenseful at parts. A part that bugs me is when they say they are going to bait the shark near the end they are saying they will use a live person as bait, but at the end nobody is used and all the shark does is swim at them and through a glass window and tries eating a bunch of people. I'm tired of great movies being ruined by bad sequels. Jaws 4: the revenge was worse though, its pretty far fetched how a shark would know the brody family and would be stalking them in the Caribbean (jaws 4 plot). Don't see this or part 4 because they both suck. Just watch the first two."

That was the only way I could describe the film and sitting throw it.\n\nWither it was the cheesy cheesy cheesy effects, I mean did every horror movie in the 80's have to be 3-D? It's rather, well, cheesy! The plot? Was there a plot I even ask? There was no main story or line for us to follow and I felt the story kept on forgetting to telling us the sub-plot.

Even the second film was better, and while I would hardly call that film a masterpiece, it was watchable.\n\nOne major problem with this film is that it's dull, in my opinion that is. I wouldn't have minded so much the sluggish pace if the suspense and plot were up to par. Sadly, neither are. The plot is both unoriginal and close to being a non-event.\n\nThe suspense, tension and thrills were what made the original so memorable, there is next to none of that here. The music and direction do not help. The music feels very predictably placed sometimes which spoils the mood of the scene, and the direction feels pedestrian and tired.\n\nThe locations are pretty good, they're not what makes the film so dull and cheap visually. That's the fault of the slip-shod editing and the rubbish effects, with the shark completely lacking menace and feeling incredibly gimmicky. Jaws 3-D also has some cheesy and trite dialogue and superficial characters that you don't care for at all.\n\nThe acting is poor. Dennis Quaid has a badly-written character, and sadly in his performance he lets that show. The other actors are either bland or annoying.\n\nSo overall, while not as bad as Revenge the film is a big mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

The movie spends way too much time showing the lives of the characters, including many unnecessary scenes that shouldn't have been in the film. The attacks are not scary or suspenseful, there is very little gore. The terror is missing in the movie! No one seems to be afraid, instead they have everything under control all the time. The only thing the movie has going for itself is the wonderful cast. Dennis Quaid is amazing as always along with Lea Thompson. Bess Armstong and Simon MacCorkindale were also good choices for their roles. Overall its a movie to laugh at, but you cant help but watch it because it contains the name Jaws on its title."

He is waiting for his brother Sean Brody (John Putch) that will spend a couple of days with them. Sean meets the skier Kelly Ann Bukowski (Lea Thompson) in a bar and dates her. The park is located in a lagoon connected to the sea through a gate. While the gates are opened with a defect, a great white shark hides inside the lagoon and nobody notes. When the mechanic Shelby Overman (Harry Grant) repairs the gate, he is attacked by the white shark and dies. Finally, the inauguration day comes and the park is crowded with families. But the shark is on the loose in the lagoon.\n\n\"Jaws 3-D\" (1983) is a forgettable movie made to explore the success of the franchise. The story is obviously unoriginal and slightly entertains. The good names of Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr and Lea Thompson in the cast and a few scenes save this film from a total failure. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Tubar\u00e3o 3\" (\"Shark 3\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first movie Jaws (1975) directed by Steven Spielberg is one of the best films he has directed other than the three great Indiana Jones movies, the first movie had good performances, likable characters, and was suspenseful to watch making it a great movie; after the second movie Jaws 2 (1978) not being as good, who knows how the third will go, especially in 3D. The third movie Jaws 3-D (1983) is not a good thriller with average performances, no likable characters to care about, bad 3D effects, and annoying/stupid people I did not care for; the effects and look of the shark works fine for the movie occasionally, but it felt like it was trying too hard to put the 3D gimmick in your face, along with the interesting setting of it being at SeaWorld for some reason.\n\nI did not care that much for the main characters because they were not as likable or funny as the main characters from the first movie; because I do not care about the characters that much, I wanted the shark to attack them, they make dumb choices when it came to saving themselves or anyone else at SeaWorld. For some reason, the characters want to hold the shark in its own room for display without killing it, which leads to things going wrong and the shark finding its way into SeaWorld; I also did not like the dialogue each character had making them sound stupid and have dumb lines that can be unintentionally funny just like the bad 3D effects throughout the movie involving underwater or in some shark attacks.\n\nThe shark is shown quite a bit with it sometimes being an animatronic and the effects are ok, except for the 3D effects; I still like how we will get the point of view of the shark from under and above the water, and the 3D effects are laughable with it trying to look like it is coming close to you. The music for the movie is ok, since it is not done by John Williams who did the first; also, you still have the main Jaws theme that is cool to listen to, along with the movie has a lot of people doing dumb things involving them somehow killing themselves or getting the shark to kill them because of them not listening to any professionals telling them to get out of the water when the shark appears.\n\nJaws 3-D (1983) is worse than the second movie with it having bad dialogue, bad characters, bad effects, and bad 3D; this sequel is not as good as the first, but it is funny to watch because of how bad it is, and the first movie Jaws (1975) was way better in giving a suspenseful shark thriller, so I would recommend watching that than this; if you liked the first film, then you will either dislike or like this, it just depends on if you like shark movies, or if you do not want to watch this because there is no Steven Spielberg directing, then I would just stick with watching and rewatching the first movie."

You don't get any better than this, and I must say, the acting, the score, and the development, all written with intellect! I do not care what any one says, this film is a true piece of work. With the same type of opening, of a P.O.V. shot in the deep blue ocean, which was missed in Jaws 2, this one has a creepy feeling from the beginning. Admittingly, the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas, but not all! The very idea of not one, but TWO sharks in Sea World as its grand opening takes place...is just freaky! Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch. Alan Parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test, and brought to a new level of scary. What most call boring, is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they, being adults, must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can. Different ideas of murder, explosions, and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed. Later, the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out, and all hell breaks loose, literally. Not so much the scares, as the shocks, are what draws me to this film, and every minute is worth while. Never trust the ocean, it is always full of suprises, and in all the wrong ways. Yes, the 3rd demension is pure terror, and Jaws 3-D will not fail to serve audiences with a real bang and boom! 9/10"

The original 3D effects are pretty obvious, except that in the non-3D version, the ones that were filmed as bluescreen shots look absolutely horrible, while the non-bluescreen ones just look silly. In one shot, a chunk of a submersible boat actually disappears before our eyes. I can only assume it didn't look that way in the 3D version, or they never would have left the shot in.\n\nCriticizing the plot seems almost beside the point. I mean, yet another huge killer shark (this makes number 3!) shows up, this time in Florida, where former two-time huge-killer-shark-attack victim Mike Brody just happens to be working at Sea World? Give me a break.\n\nI can't imagine why the Sea World people thought this was a good idea. The movie is atrocious, and makes Sea World look just awful in every possible way. On the other hand, if the movie had been really good, it would have made Sea World look like a terrifying place where visitors can easily become a shark's dinner. The idea behind this truly escapes me.\n\nI have to admit that the cable-TV version I watched was even worse than it had any right to be, since the filmmakers' incompetence was at least tripled by a horrible videotape transfer, appalling sound, and perhaps the worst pan-and-scan I have ever encountered."

This cynical and dull thriller lacks the tension and excitement that made the original 1975 Jaws so memorable, and it even pales in comparison to Jaws 2.\n\nThe concept of setting a Jaws movie in SeaWorld was intriguing, offering a significant departure from the previous films. It had potential, but unfortunately, that potential goes to waste. The script is uninspired and unengaging, populated with poorly developed characters who failed to capture my interest. Although Dennis Quaid's performance was somewhat watchable, even his charisma couldn't salvage the film. The decision to centre a third killer shark movie around the same family felt incredibly lazy, as did many of the story beats.\n\nWhile it might be unfair to critique the 3D elements of the movie since I watched it in 2D, the film heavily relies on gimmicky \"pop out\" effects that are impossible to ignore. While I can't speak for how good or bad they look in 3D, these optical effects are distractingly bad when watching the film in 2D."

Despite being years after the original the shark looks worse and to top it off there are some sequences that have been sped up and others that are in slow motion- it looks ridiculous and is an attempt to make up for a lack of quality shots or effects. The crowning (poor) moment is a shark towards the end that moves so slow and so fake towards our \"heroes\" that words fail me, just as all those who worked on this film failed their audience.

        "review_detailed_main": "By this time, it was feeling like 'another day, another Jaws film' but this time, the hook was that the film was in 3D. I think the idea of having a Jaws film in 3D is a stroke of genius \u0096 the idea of having a shark pop out at the cinema audience must've seemed as if it was on par with the discovery of gravity or the founding of new land after a six month boat journey. Alas, since I saw this film in its 2D cousin format; I didn't get the thrill I'm sure I would've got had it been in three dimensions. Given this information, I'll give my opinions based on a 2D viewing as it's only fair.\n\nI think a lot of people have a problem with the film's effects. True, having the bottom of a submarine disappear into the background and then reappear as it turns around is a sure fire way of completely zoning your audience out of the reality of the film but if it had been in 3D, I'm sure it would've created cheers instead of jeers. I've seen a 3D film at an IMAX cinema and I can tell you it's a joy to behold to see things pop out at you. These things supposedly happen in Jaws 3D at well spaced times. The shark charges at you and glass flies at the screen, dolphins do their jumping and water sprays everywhere and as I've mentioned, a one man submarine swims around on a clear blue, water background but when you're viewing them on a television, it just looks like an absolute abomination, graphics wise.\n\nWhat I liked is the way the action is moved away from the beach and the film goes down a new route; moving away from the cop-come-suspicion-come-convincing act in a refreshing way. What Jaws 3D does do differently that I'm sure it wishes it hadn't consists of numerous things. For one, you don't need to be a marine biologist to know that sharks can't swim backwards. They did so in Deep Blue Sea (1999) but we were given reason \u0096 they were genetically altered; but here, the shark just seems to feel like it \u0096 so it does so. Arguably the worst continuity error in a film of all time. Secondly, the film follows the previous Jaws instalments by having the character bicker and argue for a while; in this case the conflict is distinctly put across through the English characters and the Americans as they talk about what they'll do. The English want to kill it and the Americans want to save it; keeping it for their park. A bit of a misrepresentation, if you ask me.\n\nAlthough there are some glaring errors throughout this film: such as the shark swimming backwards and the fact it managed to break through a pane of glass that was obviously too thick since it's pressurised for being underwater. Not to mention the annoying and cheesy way the dolphins attempt to 'save the day', the film remains as an average action adventure piece that doesn't have brain cells but doesn't need them. People mark the film down for its effects but that's premature since they probably saw it on a 2D screen anyway. I thinks it's fitting how one character says to the other when they're discussing the equipment they use at the sea world park: 'You build it and I swim in it.' The same could be said for Spielberg, his original Jaws film success and its predecessors sequels \u0096 you build in it and we'll swim in it."

Like the DVD of JTR, there are no features, just the trailer and some recommendations. it would be a nice touch to include the 1983 documentary \"Jaws III Sharks don't die\" on it, so we could get a lil insite on the film history! the 3D effects are kind of corny and fake on the DVD, but if u wear 3D glasses, you can sort of see some stuff popping out.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Jaws III was a great film in my opinion. if someone reading this thinks the movie sucks, well, would u prefer this film or Jaws The revenge?"

There are worst movies in the world. Heck, there are worst Jaws movies. This is a simple fail."

It's understandable because of course compared to \"Jaws\" and in a way also \"Jaws 2\" this movie is totally ridiculous. However if you look at this movie as an individual movie instead as a part of the \"Jaws\" franchise, you'll have to admit that this movie is entertaining to watch.\n\nThis really is a B-monster movie with B-movie characters, awful dialog, silly special effects and laughable moments. Yes, fans of B-movies will truly be delighted by this movie. It really is a entertaining campy movie.\n\nStill of course as a movie this is not a very good one. The story is just completely ridiculous and the dialog is laughable at times. The movie its beginning really isn't that bad but as the movie progresses the movie becomes more and more ridicules and unbelievable. Towards the ending the movie even manages to turn into one of those typical '70's s disaster flicks, despite the fact that this movie was released in '83. The shark himself also never looked worse. The silly looking '3-D' effects also don't do much good to the movie. Still none of this takes away the entertainment value of the movie. It's certainly fun to watch and it's obvious at times that the makers and cast also didn't took the movie itself very serious. It even at fist was originally going to be a spoof of the original.\n\nVery bad as a part of the \"Jaws\" franchise, very entertaining as an individual (B)movie.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "JAWS 3-D gets a lot of undeserved hate. The film isn't nearly as bad as most people seem to think it is. It's actually a fun and enjoyable piece of early 80s cinema. The score is great, mixing old themes with all new ones. It really fits the setting well. Most of the characters are likable, interesting, and just plain funny (which adds to the enjoyment of the film) and the story itself makes for a fine old- school monster movie. A lot of the underwater scenes are dark and grainy but that just goes to enhance the atmosphere and make it even more spooky.\n\nAll of the actors play their parts well. Dennis Quaid is great as always. Lea Thomson, Louis Gossett Jr., John Putch, Simon MacCorkindale, and P. H. Moriarty all do a fine job. Bess Armstrong is probably the most annoying of the bunch but over time she's grown on me. I don't find her to be quite so bad anymore. Overall, nobody does a bad job. The first half of the film has the reputation of being boring because there is limited \"shark action,\" but to me this is the best part. This is the period that sets the mood and allows us to get to know all of the characters and builds suspense toward the eventual encounter because we know the shark is trapped in the park. By the time the second half starts and the \"shark action\" really kicks into overdrive, everything has been established, the stakes have been raised, and it just makes it all the more interesting.\n\nA lot of the 3D effects look extremely corny, especially seeing them in 2D, but that just adds to the film's overall charm. Comparing it to today's slick, ultra-glossy, extremely fake looking CGI and I greatly prefer the old cheesy effects. At least they're unique and charming rather than lifeless and completely devoid of any emotion at all (like CGI). But of all the film's complaints, the effects seem to be what gets the most scorn, and I believe that to be the main reason why the film has the reputation it does. Most people can't seem to get past the peculiar effects. The shark itself doesn't look amazing, but I definitely prefer it to the shark from either 2 or 4. But at the end of the day, I guess the bottom line for all the effects is if you're specifically looking to criticize the film for it, you'll definitely have plenty to work with. But if you're able to just sit back and enjoy the film for what it is and look past its superficial flaws, you'll have an extremely fun and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe key is to watch this film on its own and not right after the original or any of the others. Let's face it, the original JAWS is not only the best film in the franchise, it's the greatest shark movie ever made and one of the best films period of all time. Most films aren't going to measure up. The second film isn't terrible but it's definitely a major step down from the first and can be quite boring to get through, especially on repeat viewings. The fourth movie (Revenge) is a notoriously bad facepalm-inducing catastrophe of epic proportions. It literally killed off the franchise and isn't worth talking about beyond that. As a whole though, 1, 2, and 4 seem to be the real trilogy of this franchise (though I personally prefer it as 1, 2, 3). As is though, JAWS 3-D is the outlier in look, feel, and setting, but boy is it better for it. It's far and away better and more interesting than either sequel, by a long shot. It isn't boring and it certainly isn't awful. You just have to see it for what it is.... a fun, cheesy, 80s monster movie with uniquely odd effects. If you give it a chance, it may grow on you."

The first half an hour of the film is filled with Friday the 13th-grade teenagers faffing about, and when something finally does start to happen any suspense or terror is ruined by laughable special effects a 50's B-movie director would be ashamed of.

        "review_detailed_main": "When \"Jaws\" came out in 1975, it went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time (until \"Star Wars\" took that honor two years later). Three years after the film's release came \"Jaws 2\" which wasn't as scary and effective as its predecessor. Nevertheless, it made money, and the franchise distributor Universal wanted to make another \"Jaws\" film. Five years after \"Jaws 2\" came \"Jaws 3-D\". This time the filmmakers did something different. They threw in 3-D effects to conjure up scares. Why did they do this? I think it was due to the success of \"Friday the 13th Part 3\" which was released in 3-D a year earlier. That movie made money, and the makers of \"Jaws 3-D\" were hoping to cash in on the 3-D craze that was supposed to be big in 1983. During this particular year, a mess of 3-D movies came out. In addition to \"Jaws 3-D\" there was the sci-fi adventure \"Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone\" which starred Molly Ringwald (before \"Breakfast Club\"); \"Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn\", another sci-fi movie featuring Richard Moll (before TV's \"Night Court\") and Kelly Preston (before she became Mrs. John Travolta); the comedy \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" starring Steve Guttenberg (before the \"Police Academy\" and \"Cocoon\" movies); and \"Amityville 3-D\", the third in the series about a haunted house which featured Meg Ryan in one of her early film roles. \"Jaws 3-D\" was the most successful movie of this bunch, but that didn't say much. The 3-D craze didn't go into 1984 like it was predicted. In fact, all these movies got horrible reviews from critics and people stayed away from them. However, I went to see \"Jaws 3-D\" when I was only 12 years old. I really didn't know a whole lot about 3-D at the time. I was told that it was a device in a movie where things come at you. When I was going to see \"Jaws 3-D\" I, along with my mother and a friend were given those special 3-D glasses which you had to wear if you wanted to see the 3-D effects. I put the glasses on, then the movie started. It was one of the most awesome experiences I ever had while seeing a movie on the big screen. I had never seen anything like it. But that was just a one time experience. They don't make movies like this anymore, so I haven't been able to experience a 3-D movie since. \"Jaws 3-D\" is the only movie I ever went to see that was filmed in 3-D. At that time I didn't care if the movie was critically bad and poorly made. I went to see it and had a good time. And on the basis of that one time movie going experience, I give \"Jaws 3-D\" three stars. But (and this is a big but), on home video and on TV the movie is knows simply as \"Jaws III\". The 3-D effects don't come at you on the small screen as they did on the big screen. And that's disappointing. \"Jaws 3-D\" was only memorable for its 3-D effects, but since the effects don't come at you on the small screen, \"Jaws III\" is forgetable. And that's the version you'll be seeing of this movie from here on out. So I can only give \"Jaws III\" two stars.\n\n** (out of four)"

But then, as per the late nineties approximately, we literally received an overflow of inferior and quite often downright retarded killer shark flicks. And now all of a sudden, the aforementioned Jaws sequels actually don't look too terrible anymore. It started in the late 90's with the still traditional but totally inept \"Deep Blue Sea\" and \"Shark Attack\", but then since the new Millennium things really got out of control with murderous sharks popping up in the most illogical of places (like the rivers in Venice, in Tsunami infested areas, swamps, etc\u0085) and \u2013 worse even \u2013 all kinds of ridiculous hybrids and genetically altered species, like dinosaur sharks, octopus-sharks and two-headed sharks. Sigh \u0085 whatever happened to good-old fashioned massively over-sized Great Whites, like in our classic early 80's stinker \"Jaws 3-D\"? Now, please don't misunderstand me, the third installment in the Jaws franchise is still a very lousy film, but at least it's not bad in a frustrating or annoying way. The underdeveloped screenplay, the laughable attempt to bring depth to the main characters, the hilarious 3D effects and all the totally irrelevant padding footage \u0085 It almost feels cheesy and charming in a positive sort of way now. Interesting detail here is that Universal Studios, the mastodon production company behind the Jaws franchise, sued the creators of an obscure Italian imitation for being too reminiscent, but then they were hypocrite enough to steal ideas from the movie they accused of stealing from them! That's Hollywood for you, I guess. The script attempts, poorly I may add, to build a bridge between the previous two movies by depicting the Brody boys (the sons of Roy Scheider) as pivot characters in the grand opening of a brand new Florida Ocean theme park. Mike, the oldest one, works there as the head engineer and his younger brother Sean \u2013 supposedly still suffering from his childhood trauma even though he blindly follows the first cute girl he meets straight in the water for a nightly swimming session \u2013 comes to visit him for the ceremony. Due to malfunctioning underwater fences and unreliable technical staff, the park quickly receives unforeseen visitors in the shape of a great white shark and its offspring. Also in good old Jaws tradition, the park's senior executive initially hopes to exploit the baby shark as a unique special attraction without realizing he puts the lives of hundreds of guests and personnel in danger. When Junior White dies in front of many spectators, mommy goes on a relentless killing and destruction spree. The body count is intolerably low for a shark movie, but that's probably because all the action is concentrated in the last twenty minutes of the film. Throughout more than an hour, we're only exposed to uninteresting relationship issues, dull family conversations and a whole lot of random waterskiing footage. Most of the supportive characters are embarrassing stereotypes (an Australian outback hunter?) and the effects are hysterical even by early 80's standards. Especially the shark's ultimate attack is legendary, as he approaches the underwater control room in slow motion while the people inside just pull stupid faces."

The so-called \"story\" is a failed attempt at changing the locale to an aquatic theme park called \"Sea World\" where Chief Brody's now-grown son Michael works. Rather conveniently, two sharks (mother and child?) manage to gain access to the underwater kingdom to wreak havoc.\n\nSounds like it has potential? Forget it. The new shark scenes are sillier than ever, the level of tension and suspense is nil, and the characters are completely uninteresting. The worst served here is actor Lou Gossett Jr., who was so excellent in the previous year's AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. What a waste. Dennis Quaid plays Mike without much to do, and while his love interest Bess Armstrong is cute in a girl-next-door sort of way, she leaves no impression either. The selling point of the film in 1983 was its 3-D effects, and these look absolutely pathetic on your 2-D home screen.\n\nA really, really bad and muddled movie and easily one of the very worst sequels to a classic motion picture ever made. This was followed by JAWS: THE REVENGE in 1987, and as maligned as that next film is by fans and critics, the truth is it turned out a little better than Number Three. * out of ****"

How several of the cast members went on to have good careers is amazing.\n\nThere is no tension at all in any of the scenes.\n\nThis film has no right to be associated with Jaws or Jaws 2.

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know how to explain what it is about Jaws 3 that I really, really don't like. The bad special effects, acting, direction, writing, etc. have all been mentioned to death. And yes, it was a really big dumb mistake to go all 3-D gimmicky. That's probably why they picked Joe Alves, the production designer from the first Jaws movie as well as others (Escape From New York, for example, another very grimy-dark and somewhat shoddy looking movie) to direct--the guy was obviously better with everything other than the human portions of the scenery. Or maybe not. The whole movie looks very flat and colorless...lifeless. It's strange.\n\nNo, I think what really kills this movie for me is that seems very...I don't know...UNPLEASANT. There are ways to take even the most misanthropic horror, the silliest and most glaringly fake special effects, and make it compelling, interesting, and somehow cool to watch. It's a very subtle thing which I can't put my finger on. Jaws 3 doesn't come close. As ridiculous as the movie is, it tries to be relentlessly dark, and there are hints of a kind of nastiness or something which doesn't scare me, or even horrify me, but just make me feel very uncomfortable instead, like I need to take a shower afterwards. Perhaps it tries to be too literal when it begs to be stylized. Perhaps it's too dead serious when it's obviously claptrap. There some kind of jarring collision going on, something isn't working right. Basically the thing is the visual equivalent of indigestion.\n\nI will admit that certain things like sound effects work almost too well--the crunching as another vapid Floridian becomes fish food, the muffled underwater groans and shouts. But it's not horrifying in a good, entertaining way, you know? There is one very inventive shot, I also have to admit--the one prick cameraman diver gets eaten, and you watch the poor bastard getting chewed from INSIDE the shark's gullet.\n\nI think I may have an answer. It seems like unlike many horror movies, which simply like to show off gore effects and photogenic ways to kill people, Jaws 3 seems to revel specifically in helpless suffering, prolonging people's pain while they die. Even that poor fish at the beginning doesn't just get eaten...the severed head floats there half-alive for half a minute, uselessly working its mouth, just to drive the point home. It's a distinctly sadistic movie. Perhaps we need to coin a new movie genre for films like this: loathing movies. As such Jaws 3 would probably rank up there with The Passion Of The Christ or something as one of the all-time greats. It's a crappie (pun intended), extremely unpleasant movie to watch overall, but it does achieve its dubious goal unnervingly well. I will give it that."

        "review_detailed_main": "Much can be said about the 1983 \"Jaws 3-D\" movie, which is the third movie in the \"Jaws\" franchise. However, I have to admit that I have always enjoyed it ever since watching it for the first time as a child in the 1980s.\n\nThe storyline in \"Jaws 3-D\" is actually good. I thoroughly enjoyed the concept of placing a shark in captivity and exhibit it, only to have the shark wreak havoc on the themepark and the visitors. Corny? Perhaps, but it actually provided me with adequate entertainment. I think writers Richard Matheson, Carl Gottlieb and Guerdon Trueblood actually put together quite an enjoyable script and storyline for the movie.\n\nThe acting performances in \"Jaws 3-D\" are good and they have a good cast ensemble, despite the fact that no one from the first two movies are in it. However, the movie does have the likes of Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Simon MacCorkindale, Louis Gossett Jr. And Lea Thompson on the cast list, so you are in good company.\n\nSure, the special effects in the movie are somewhat dubious. Especially the slow motion scene where the shark is swimming towards the glass window. I mean, that scene is so cringeworthy that you can't help but laugh. It was supposed to be an intense and scary scene, but it comes off as quite the opposite. However, in overall, I have to say that the shark effects in \"Jaw 3-D\" are actually fair enough, and I enjoy them.\n\nPerhaps \"Jaws 3-D\" is a guilty pleasure, but I have always enjoyed it, and I still do.\n\nMy rating of director Joe Alves' 1983 movie \"Jaws 3-D\" lands on a six out of ten stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yep, another guilty pleasure movie. This one is sooooo awful it's amazing. Just everything about it is so lame. The effects are terrible - they might have been better in 3D, but on a TV screen the plasticky-ness of it is all too apparent. The acting is well below par for the big names on show here, with some horrible dialogue thrown in just to make things worse.\n\nIn fact, only the basic premise of the movie has any promise - a killer shark attacking an underwater theme/amusement park. But the idea, though good, is drowned (pun intended) by the terrible crapness of the other elements of the film.\n\nThat said, the movie entertained me, but not in any traditional horror sense. Rather I found myself laughing so much at the lame effects, bad dialogue and the terrible liberties taken with physics and shark facts that the movie was a fantastic journey of delightful nonsense. Not so much the Hunting of the Snark, but the Hunting of the Shark! If you see what I mean.\n\nThere is, in fact so much non-stop nonsense that it gets a bit overwhelming at times. The shark is about as lifelike as a rubber shark can get, but towards the end there are some especially dire effects of the shark with its head stuck in the control room window. The stop-motion animation of the tail is extremely bad - you'll see better on most kids animated puppet shows - and the tail doesn't so much sweep back and forth as just twitch inanely. Of course, how it got stuck in the window is almost as hilarious. In 3D it might have looked OK, but on a TV screen (no matter how big) the shark just seemed to drift up to window with all the menace (and realism) of a bath toy shark. This scene 's hilarity was compounded by the looks of absolute horror on the faces of the control room occupants. Priceless! No matter how much you want to turn off, it's worth waiting to see this scene alone.\n\nOf course, the general physics is just as abused as the shark info. A grenade goes off underwater, not twenty feet from a couple of divers and they're not even stunned a tiny amount - no burst eardrums at all. Bah! Who cares if water is virtually incompressible! It won't transmit the shock wave at all! No sir!\n\nIf you fancy a terrifying journey into horror beneath the waves you'd be better off watching The Adventures of Captain Nemo (well, Burgess Meredith as Prof. Cunningham scared me, anyhow). But, if you fancy an awful, awful movie to laugh at with your mates and a crate of beer, this one is top notch stuff."

        "review_detailed_main": "On Netflix, the movie is called \"Jaws 3,\" probably because the 3-D effects are so unimaginably bad they decided to forget the \"D.\" Recently, my viewing of the original \"Jaws\" became a Jaws-a-Thon of watching Jaws 2-4 (Revenge). The review scores range, in order, range from 8, 5.8, 3.7, and 3 for J1 to Revenge. If ever there was a proof that sequels are the kiss of death, this franchise is it, and I use the word \"franchise\" loosely. In some ways, Revenge is actually better than 3. At least in Revenge, the shark had the good taste to upchuck Mario Van Peebles for his totally fake sounding Jamaican accent.\n\nFirst, J3 is one large product placement for Sea World. The acting is terrible. Rather than making Mike Brody into likeable quality, Dennis Quaid turns him into an \"anti-character\" that seem to telegraph the message \"I know this movie is a loser; what was I thinking? Oh yeah,...paycheck.\" Lou Gossett has done a better job in far better movies. Lea Thompson's cuteness couldn't save it. The rest are forgettable.\n\nJaws 3 is predictable and boring, and any cinematic qualities are overshadowed by how awful the movie is. The original Jaws movie had the benefit of being the first, but any novelty was wearing thin in the second installment. By 3 and 4, it was old hat. If they would come out with \"Jaws, the Musical,\" it couldn't get much worse."

Besides, I was too mesmerized by her beautiful eyes, long hair, and wonderful smile. Wow, you gotta love those Minnesota women! Okay, back to the flick: I'm trying to think of a movie I have seen that starred Louis Gossett Jr, that wasn't a bomb. Help here! Remember Iron Eagle? THAT movie stunk! Again, he picked a script that had no substance. All of the scare of the original Jaws was completely lost in this movie.\n\nAnd finally, the cinematography is horrible. I don't know if the 3-D had anything to do with that, but the whole film seems very grainy, like an early 70's film. Maybe it was old stock.\n\nTo summarize: Watch this film ONLY if you're in the Lea Thompson fan club, like myself. Otherwise, go outside; it's probably a nice day that's passing you by."

The underwater vessel is pretty cool and the infusion of dolphins in the storyline I always liked as a kid. Unfortunately of all the movies in this series this probably has the worst actual shark.

There is also some poorly done green screen and it, clearly, has a dire cover. There's no doubting this being made was a cash grab, that's basically the only reason to ever go 3-D, but a cash grab doesn't necessarily mean it's an awful film; which this isn't, in my opinion.

        "review_detailed_main": "Michael Brody is all grown up and is now a park worker at Florida's Sea World with his marine biologist girlfriend Kathryn. The new man-made lagoon with its maze of underwater tunnels called the \"Undersea Kingdom\" is shortly to open, but before doing so a great white shark is caught in the lagoon and with some convincing; owner Calvin Bouchard sees it as an opportunity to generate some business for the park. So on the opening day a dead body of a missing worker is found, but Kathryn realises that it wasn't their great white which killed the man. It was it's mother who is approximately 35-foot long and is living unknowingly in the lagoon.\n\nWow, what crap! Yeah it's bad, but despite the negative flack that this film always seems to cop; at least it's watchable trite. For me this is one big guilty pleasure and it's actually my favourite 'Jaws' sequel\u0085 oh my! I think it was the last one I saw in the series (and Jaws the Revenge being the first\u0085 ugh!) Well, the sequels are simply stinkers with the franchise turning into somewhat of a joke (thankyou \"Jaws The Revenge\"). But I thoroughly enjoyed this scratchy and quite corny flick. Actually, the concept for the film isn't too bad, but it's just the execution where it goes awry and the script is a bit of a groaner too. Well really, the rotten to the core special effects is what sticks out like a sore thumb, though it made it even more amusing in it's ineptness. That's because originally the film was released in 3D, but since the images are in 2D is looks quite bad and flat. Who knows the gimmick might have blown me away\u0085 eh, probably not, but I still think that I would get a good laugh out of it. Well it would add more to the factor since the film is simply an unintentional comedy\u0085 yeah comedy, because there isn't too much in the way of thrills. It was just too goofy to be effective with only one or two suspenseful spurts that will raise a sweat, but more so it's plain cringe-worthy and simply implausible.\n\nThe useless screenplay is pretty thin and dramatically flat across the board, but I give them points for a change of scenery. The film's setting is perfect and it's a real change of pace. I don't know if you can actually call it Jaws' show, since it basically took every opportunity to promote Florida's Sea World, even if there was a shark on the loose eating guests. But it centres more about the park and disaster this whole mayhem plays on it, which in doing so makes us want more bang for our buck. The hysteria and shark attack scenes are reasonably quick flashes and just lacking the killer blow. But I didn't find it too much of a problem.\n\nBut good gawd the shark looked terrifyingly\u0085 horrid! Seeing a shark close up would be petrifying, but here that's not the case because this rubber, robotic clap-trap was totally unconvincing and incredibly overdone. We just see too much of it and I never knew sharks growl. Oh well, if you can't scare the audience at least you got to amaze them in some shape. It also surprisingly builds up an atmosphere when the uninvited guests go munching and the underwater scenes are done quite well. The time goes by quick enough even with some irreverent padding. But for some people I can see why think its dull and that's because of the lack of horrific terror. The slow-motion sequences were horrifying, though! The music score is simply unspectacular with the trivial main theme making the only progress. The acting seems to be torn to shreds by people, but I thought Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr. and Simon MacCorkindale gave modest performances with weak characters.\n\nAn entertaining B-flick that's not that particularly exciting, but it tried to be different and I still I don't think its that dire as a lot people make it out to be. I don't know if it would make the film any better being in 3D, but the novelty of it would have been interesting."

        "review_detailed_main": "I know most people think the last Jaws movie is terrible but, it is a classic compared to this one. There are so many issues with this one and I want to point out some of the highlights or low-lights depending on how you look at it.\n\n1. Obviously anybody watching this movie is watching it for the shark but, they could have at least attempted to give some attention to the characters and stories. The only time this movie has your interest at all is when the shark is present. It felt like all the actors/actresses were just going through the motions but, you can't blame them when you consider what they're working with.\n\n2. Why was so much of the movie almost pitch black? I realize that it wouldn't be realistic for it to bright underwater, especially at night but, enough light to actually see what is happening would've been nice. There are many scenes where you might as well close your eyes since you can't make anything out. That includes most of the final 10 or 15 minutes and a scene early on that is not even in the water.\n\n3. As I stated earlier, you are watching because of the shark but, you don't really see much of it and it's too dark to actually see it most of the time it is on screen.\n\n4. This is not so much a complaint as an observation. Watch for a special effect shot at the end that is so bad, it's hard to believe it made it into the movie even if it was a 3-D shot. It's the next to last 3-D shot if I remember correctly."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the box office success of Jaws 2, Universal Studios wanted to moving on with Jaws franchise. Carl Gottlieb who wrote the previous Jaws movies came back, to write the screenplay but helped with the writer Richard Matheson. In the making of the movie the filmmakers decided to release the third Jaws in 3D, as there were other horror movies like Friday the 13th Part III which also used the 3D technique. It is a good way to see a movie with a technique, which would make the story immersive to feel being inside of it. After an exhausting work on the production, in 1983 came out Jaws 3-D with Dennis Quaid. The movie's plot: the sons of chief police Martin Brody, Mike and Sean who are grown up now. They work at the theme park SeaWorld, where a great white shark gets trapped inside of it. But then the main characters would realize, the mother of the great white shark is inside of the theme park as well. Jaws 3-D could be an interesting movie as there have been some changes, without using any actors or actresses of the previous Jaws movies. Instead the movie completely failed to surprise the audience and the critics, as it just bored to be a totally uninteresting story. Especially for the use of the cliches in the course of the movie, which can easily distract the audience to not let them focus on the story. The effects of 3D in the movie makes hilarious and annoying as most of the scenes, were focused on the stuffs which would be thrown to the audience's eyes in an inappropriate way. The actors tried to act as good as possible their performances, but it wouldn't change anything to have a second thought about the movie. Jaws 3-D is one of the worst movies of all time."

But I must warn you, IF THE QUALITY OF SPECIAL EFFECTS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU, you will HATE this film. One of the big things I judge a film on is its showmanship. Jaws 3 would not have failed this. The acting was good, the storyline was good, even the exhibition was good.\n\nWhat absolutely KILLED this film was the special effects. The CG was very unrealistic, and you could clearly tell where it was inserted. The shark... well, I'd imagine that \"Bruce\" (the original shark for \"Jaws\") is turning in his prop room grave, or wherever they decided to put him. The shark they built for this one didn't look much like a shark, and in several scenes, the shark was obviously the puppet. In the first \"Jaws\" film, it was harder to tell.\n\nSorry fan boys and girls. Like I said, the concept of the movie was a good one. The exhibition, however, failed to live up to the \"Jaws\" name."

The 3D is just ridiculously horrid in a few parts.

Too bad, because this fun-but-not-great movie could have been much better. Jaws 3D might just get better rating if it was revised in HD with some of the 3D cuts removed (Or a 3D version- Yes!). Jaws 3D is also quite different in both tone and style from the other films. Both Jaws 1 and 2 seem to focus on being trapped on the open sea, Jaws 3D is more claustrophobic-based. And the style is also very different from 2 and 1, One is very thriller styled, whereas two is more showy. Surprisingly this film is not as showy as Jaws 2. It's style is just strait horror. And Jaws: TR- It's tone and style are pretty much \"Watching jaws 2 while you're high\" In all I thought it was an okay film, but a mixed bag.

I haven't seen Jaws 4 yet, but it didn't look to bad. But Jaws 3, ... I'll probably never watch it (willingly) again. The basic problem: too much people, and not enough shark. (however big it was, not the point) Also, the special FX made the original Donkey Kong game look good. If you really want to, then fine, but this is one of a very VERY few movies that I absolutely hate.\n\nBut that's just me..."

        "review_detailed_main": "This might be the first movie from the 1980's that I've seen use the 3D effect because when I watched Friday the 13th Part 3 it must have been a different version without it. Needless to say the 3D gimmick back then was even more of a hacky trick than it is today. At least in today's 2D versions, I can't tell where the 3D effects would be, unlike the corny scenes in Jaws 3 that are obviously filmed for 3D effect. I may have liked this film much better if this wasn't the case since it had loads of potential. Dennis Quaid as Michael Brody was tremendous and stood out in the film as a great lead actor. Bess Armstrong was pretty good too, otherwise the remaining supporting cast was bland.\n\nThe plot was fair but the whole branding of SeaWorld kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Considering SeaWorld is a corporation that at the time in the 1980's had a very likely chance of treating animals poorly. Just like in Part 2 with the sailing scenes, there was a lot of fluff scenes that was basically performances by the SeaWorld staff. A lot of the plot premises were too unbelievable and some of the decision making by the characters didn't make a whole lot of sense. The ending was by far the worst part of the movie, not because of the storyline but from the 3D filmmaking and terribly fake looking death scenes. If the film didn't have the 3D effect and let Dennis Quaid guide the movie through I'm sure it would have been as good as Jaws 2."

Unintentional humor being the requisite hallmark of any \"good\" B-movie, this film has plenty of it. Dialogue and acting that borders on the truly comedic, ill-defined meandering characters, loads of unexplained shots, scenes, and material-this is not the \"best\" B-movie I have seen, but it is entertaining nonetheless. The effects are perhaps the most overtly amateurish aspect of the film, and sure to get the biggest laughs (especially the end). But a discerning viewer will find more humor in the dialogue and acting (read: Gosset Jr.), vague characters (read: the British/Australian/Whatever shark killers/photographers), and terribly edited action. So, for B-movie fans, I give this a 3 out of 5."

As a movie about a sea themed waterpark's disastrous opening day due to a giant great white shark inhabiting the park's water, it's an entertaining film with an interesting scenario. Even though the shark scenes are dull and unrealistic, at least it's interesting watching the people react to the situation. And one of the stars is the ever so likable Dennis Quaid. Jaws 3 is not a hard movie to sit through."

        "review_detailed_main": "The opening credits read \"suggested by the novel, Jaws, by Peter Benchley\". Exactly what part of his novel inspired this low rent monster flick?\n\nAnyway, despite being written by the original screenwriters of the first two films, Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler, this has nothing to do with Jaws I or II. It is largely a mediocre throwback to 1950s monster movies, even released originally in 3D, which only makes it seem even more like a 1950s B-movie. One gets the feeling, however, that even in cinemas, in 3D, the effects were largely unnoticeable; I forgot that it was originally filmed in 3D, except for when Jaws' jaws come flying at the screen during the climax, and two or three times dolphins are shown jumping out of the water toward the camera, in an incredibly cheesy, 1970s greeting card type of montage.\n\nShark and mommy shark on the loose at Sea World(!) and a cast of soon- to-be-famous people have to do battle with them, blandly and boringly. Lea Thompson is cute in this, her first film role, but apparently the filmmakers didn't think much of her, because after receiving a bad cut on her leg at the climax, her character is never mentioned again. Simon MacCorkindale was clearly unfamiliar with his lines of dialogue, as he obviously stutters and stammers his way through them several times.\n\nThe plot is only mediocre, in a campy, so-bad-it's-good way; the same can be said about the effects. The climax is a low rent rip off of the first film's ending: instead of large yellow barrels, and a canister of compressed air exploding to kill the shark, this time we get tiny yellow grenades to explode and kill the shark, and wake up the dozing audience members.\n\nTruthfully though, this isn't quite as awful as its reputation has it. I probably prefer this film to Jaws II, slightly. It's lame, but at least they didn't just try to copy the first film as closely as possible, like they did with part 2. And again, it is slightly amusing, in a 1950s monster movie/ so-bad-it's good type of way. But unless you're into that sort of thing, you'll quickly be bored to tears."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the second sequel to Jaws, Sea World's new multi-million dollar underwater attraction is terrorized by a 35 foot great white shark, putting both staff and the public in danger. It's up to Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) to uphold the family's legacy as shark fighters and save the day.\n\nI was \"fortunate\" enough to see Jaws 3-D in the theater back when it was originally released in 1983. I didn't care for it back then and, if anything, I found it even worse as I re-watched it last night. There are so many problems I have with the film I really don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with the 3D. As best as I can remember, the 3D effects weren't overly impressive back in the day. But watching in 2D, they're even more annoying. The floating arm near the beginning of the film, for example, looks just plain old stupid. The rest of the effects are equally bad. The shark is laughable. The shark from the original Jaws, made years earlier, is so much better.\n\nAs bad as the effects are, the rest of the film is even worse. The film's logic is pretty much non-existent, the characters are pretty much unlikable, and the script is pretty much a dull mess. There's not much here to like. Watching last night, I'm shocked that Sea World actually let the makers of Jaws 3 not only use their facilities for filming, but allowed them to use the Sea World name. Sea World must have believed in the old adage that there's no such thing as bad publicity. The film makes the staff and ownership of Sea World look like a bunch of bumbling idiots who can't be bothered to give two shakes about customer safety.\n\nSpeaking of \"can't be bothered\", I can't be bothered to go into any more detail on Jaws 3-D. I'll end this by saying that, for me, this is the worst of the Jaws series. I know most people rate Part 4 the worst. While I agree that it's one stinker of a film, at least Part 4 is entertaining. Jaws 3-D is just bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is absolutely nothing that this movie has anything to redeem itself, and that is just really sad. So after we got the first two \"Jaws\" movies, we got to have another one as this franchise keeps milking itself and this time it has gone to a third dimension. Yes, this movie was entirely shot in 3D during the 80s, and I hate to tell you this, I have never saw this movie as it was originally shot. I only saw this in 2D only, and I don't think that Universal Studios wouldn't bother to reissue this movie on Blu Ray with the 3D version. Also, I don't know how good the 3D version is, and I really don't know if it makes the movie a little better. So, what do I know about? So speaking of 3D, the movie is about another great white shark attacking more people, but this time it is attacking at a theme park known as Sea World (I'll admit that I actually like having a shark attacking at Sea World, but that is not saying much). Also, we have Martin Brody's son working at Sea World as he tries to protect the tourist from getting attack by a shark. So, that is what the plot of the third movie is, and I think its really lame. The characters aren't really that interesting, and nothing much to their personalities. However, I do like some of the actors in this movie like Dennis Quad, Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson but their performances don't save the movie. I really don't care much of the rest of the cast, and really don't have much comment of their acting. Heck, really don't care for the music at all. Joe Alves, who was the production designer of the first two \"Jaws\" movies was chosen to direct this movie, and I really don't think he is really that capable on making a good \"Jaws\" movie. Again, about the 3D, I don't know if that version is better than 2D, but I do say that the 3D effects are very cheesy looking. The shark itself looks fine as it was all done practical, but the real life footage is hardly used in this movie because of the use of 3D. Even that one part, where the shark comes to break the glass slowly which I find it laughable. The movie does have some laughable moments like some tourist push a girl to the glass, where there is a dead man outside underwater. Also, the British guy's buddy yelling so loud by how much he has been overreacting. One scene in the movie, where you have two thugs that are trying to steal coral, which I think it should have been cut out because its adds absolutely nothing to the movie. Very pointless, if you think about it. I don't have much comment about the pacing, but it is 99 minutes and really can't comment if this movie bores me or not. So I'll let you be the judge of that on your own views of the movie, but if you enjoy it for its silliness that is fine. To me, there is nothing much to recommend that this movie is so bad its good, so I say that its just bad. \"Jaws 3-D\" is lame and silly, and I personally give it a 2 out of 10."

I suppose they made the shark out of rubber and put some wires on it or something. Yeah, like these actors would be missed.\n\nThe story revolves around a couple of Brodys hanging out at Sea World (why do all these people keep getting jobs near water?). One day, the staff catches a shark and things begin to take a turn for the worse. The boss actually decides to just show this great white to everyone in some kind of pool surrounded with an ankle-high wall. I see nothing wrong with that apart from the fact that the shark still doesn't manage to kill anyone. A problem he suffers from the entire movie actually, you'd think giant sharks can outswim people but apparently not. This shark is pretty goddamn lazy. A bunch of people fall into the water right in front of him, they all make it. Unbelievable.\n\nOkay, I can't really be fair about this movie because I never watched the movie in 3D. But then again, I don't think it would have made much of a difference. Of course, seeing parts of sharks flying in your face is amusing but it gets old really fast. However, I still think this is the best \"Jaws\"-sequel, for the simple fact that I hated the others even more."

It has something to do with sharks though what exactly it is about them is never explained. The weak story continues in this fashion. Some worker guy gets ate by jaws which leads us baby jaws that they capture. Poor baby jaws didn't last that long due to poor cage conditions and the shock of a lot staring at it. For some reason they a couple teens show up who are there to steal choral well you pretty much predict what happens to those guys. Nothing happens until the end of movie but the apparent exciting ending isn't that exciting at all. The underwater special effects in this movie were bad and look so dated.

        "review_detailed_main": "I just watched this movie last night.\n\nI must say, the first hour of it is somewhat compelling. But the fact of the matter remains, I have been a big fan of sharks since I was about three years old, and what this film does is retain the shark physics very well. Shark behavior, on the other hand, is completely reversed (great whites only tend to go in for \"hit-and-run attacks\") but that's really not the point of this film.\n\nWhat this movie is made for is purely entertainment. While the first Jaws had a tremendous amount of psychological tension, this film provides only death, death, death. More people are killed in this film than any other Jaws film. Not to mention that they made the shark the largest it could possibly be (35 ft). The 35 foot great white is as rare as fist-sized diamonds, but we see one in this film--thank God, though, for the size of the shark does save the film ever so slightly.\n\nThe first hour of the film consists of tension regarding a smaller, ten foot long baby shark that is kept in captivity, being the only great white in such a state. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong provide the leading roles here, and they are both incredibly good actors that have been given an incredibly mundane script. However, as a shark fan, I recommend this film for its scientific accuracy in the first half.\n\nOnce the information is relayed to Louis Gosset Jr.'s character, Calvin, the story begins to turn sour. At first, the shark appears among a group of black-tips and sand tigers (less dangerous and smaller aquarium-type sharks) outside of SeaWorld's more expensive dining area, and it really scares the living hell out of the tourists (imagine a 35-foot black-eyed monster suddenly appearing around sharks no larger than perhaps six feet right in front of you).\n\nFrom there on, the whole movie turns to trash. It's like Godzilla underwater. The shark looks claymated (seriously) and it's vile and malicious. Sharks really aren't that smart. I don't believe any shark would ever smash its way into an undersea control room, but this one does. Also, I recall reading that sharks need to keep moving through the sea to survive (other than the sleeper shark), but this one has no trouble camping out for ten minutes to claim several victims. Also, I realize that this shark needs quite a bit of food to sustain itself (hello, 35 friggin' FEET!!!) but the fact is, it eats a few people, and yet the first of the people it eats in the second half of the film is not even swallowed, even after another victim is (see the film, you will understand what I mean by this).\n\nThe best part of this film is the part in which a diver is trapped inside the mouth of the beast. For about three minutes we watch as this diver is chewed up (and really empathetically feel his tension). The camera angles for this time frame all appear inside the monster's mouth and the whole experience is coupled with a sense of intense claustrophobia that cannot be replicated in any other film.\n\nThis movie was overall a hunk of garbage, but to fans of sharks like myself, a few shots of vodka can make Jaws III very interesting, but further than that, I would call it utter crap."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jaws 3 moves away from Amity Island and goes to Sea World where Michael Brody, the son of the now deceased Martin Brody, is now a marine biologist. Sea world has just opened up an underwater walk through so people can view marine life, and the new attraction is a baby Great White Shark. Unfortunately, the shark's mommy comes looking for it and wreaks all kinds of havoc in the process. Now it's up to Michael to stop the shark. With astoundingly bad special effects and acting, Jaws 3 makes the second film look like Ben Hur.\n\nEven what remains of John Williams' score couldn't make this movie the least bit chilling. The makers of this film decided to switch it up from the first one and show the shark any chance they get. Unfortunately, the special effects are so bad in this movie that the shark looks like a cartoon among reality. The tail doesn't even move as it swims through the water. They even make the shark roar like a lion, even though that's impossible. The plot of this movie is too simple. Mommy shark looks for baby shark. Kills people. Michael Brody must stop it. Anything beyond that is useless filler. The second film was understandable because it took place in the same area where it would be more likely to see another shark. Now we're at Sea World where Michael Brody works, and another killer shark shows up! Michael's gotta think there's a curse on him. When he was 12, the first shark swam right by him after killing somebody. When he was 16, he was attacked on a sailboat by another shark. Now he's grown up working at Sea World and another one attacks him! That's a 1 in a billion chance, but whatever.\n\nDennis Quaid plays the role of Michael Brody to the best of his ability at the time, but it's not that good. Louis Gosset Jr. is okay, but he was always kind of a B actor. All of the other actors in this movie aren't worthy of being called actors.\n\nOverall, Jaws 3 completely ruins the impact the first film had, and is a waste of everyone's time.\n\n3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's the early 1980's. Horror cinema is beginning to see a new light, in particular, the slasher film movement, where iconic franchises such as Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween are being born. According to the documentary Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, every studio, big or small, was pressing their luck on the silver screen when it came to slasher films. They were a huge attraction for young teens who needed a good scare on a Friday night. Consequently, many random slasher films came out (IE: April Fools Day Happy Birthday to Me) and many sequels to other horror films came out.\n\nThis is where Jaws 3 comes in. I only make note about slashers because Jaws 3, in particular, reminds me more of a slasher film than anything else. For one, its pacing is reminiscent of one of the early Friday the 13th films in terms of being very slow (only this time, it doesn't amount to anything remotely frightening), and, to compare it to Friday the 13t: Part 3 - the infamous 3D chapter of the series - it's one gigantic gimmick to showcase its 3D effects. So what happens when you take away that gimmick, like when Jaws 3 was down-converted in the process of its home video release? At the time, VHS and Betamax, the two formats during the film's release, couldn't manage 3D capability, so as a result, the medium that made Jaws 3 different from many horror films was suddenly taken away and what was left was nothing but a bland, interchangeable affair, with poor special effects, little pacing, and the power to be forgotten hours after being viewed.\n\nThe story, for the first time, takes place away from Amity Island and is now at SeaWorld, where underwater tunnels are being constructed for a new exhibit. Employees, including marine biologist Kay Morgan (Bess Armstrong) and Michael Brody (Dennis Quaid), discover that a baby shark has slipped through one of the underwater tunnels and may be responsible for several disappearances in the park. Upon being captured, more still disappear, and it becomes clear the real killer was the mother great white shark and not her offspring. This sends the SeaWorld staff into a panicking frenzy, unsure of what exactly to do about their shark problem.\n\nThe one common criticism I have for all of the Jaws sequels is their slowness in progression. In the first film, the shark didn't appear until roughly the hour mark, giving us time to acquaint ourselves with the staff of the beach, the area of Amity Island, and be smitten with Spielberg's clear direction and Verna Fields' priceless editing. In the sequels, the time between the opening credits and the first time we saw the shark is nothing but bloated filler; the film giving us an illusion that it has characters to care about, places to go, suspense to have us experience, and tension in its scenes. They have nothing. Even when they look like they do, they still flounder under the emptiness of their own screenplays. The times the shark wasn't on screen, I wanted to see one. The times they came on screen, I simply wanted the film to end.\n\nJaws 3's most fascinating feature, however, is not its inclusion of 3D, or its release history. It's that the man credited for the story is a man by the name of \"Guerdon Trueblood.\"\n\nStarring: Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong. Directed by: Joe Alves."

With this one they tried to give it a new spin by making it 3-D. Unfortunately, this completely works against it as the effects are awful.\n\nAnd without decent shark effects, the movie has taken a massive nose-dive already. But coupled in with an utterly uninteresting script, awful characters and lack of suspense and scares, it fails on every level.\n\nAvoid like the plague, even Revenge (The hideous sequel) is more passable IMO."

I watch them because they're supposed to be edgy thrillers about anti-social sharks with a taste for pale, thrashing, snacks.\n\nI do have to say that something about this one MIGHT have worked better for another shark film or one about some other undersea psychopathic mammal.

JAWS 3-D is actually entertaining for more than just its campiness, but that's just generally why its mildly entertaining. Although this dreary series slowly hitting the dump, this one is actually quite a guilty pleasure.\n\nI've heard some pretty bad reviews about this sequel. That's simply too bad, I quite enjoyed this one, depending on how you view it. It has a real twist from the first two. This shark doesn't terrorize Amity like the first two. This one takes place in Sea World (not the one in Florida which we know and love). The shark is bigger than the usual and is wrecking havoc on a grand opening ceremony when her infant, who was captured and kept in the park, died recently. Now throw in some ridiculous scare tactics and it's an amusing film, granted not a great one, but certainly deserves even a little bit of merit.\n\nBy the looks of it, it hardly bears resemblance to its predecessors, except that it features Mike Brody, played by Dennis Quaid. The film co-stars Louis Gossett Jr. giving an over-the-top performance, but as far as I can see he is the only good performer. The special-effects are terrible (not good then, just plain laughable now) but there are some really good moments and the ending with the shark is superb (even if the effects are amateurish even for 80's standards).\n\nNot as bad as they say, if only for its camp value. Watch out for that fake shark crashing through the glass!\n\nRating: ** out of 5."

I have no idea what grabbed me about the film initially. It's a total disaster.\n\nThe filmmakers tried something new with the story, so one star for trying something new. It's just that the execution is laughable. There's no suspense here at all. Every character is uninteresting and badly written. Since it was filmed with 3-D effects in mind the results on DVD look horrible, Mars Needs Women is on par with this one. The film drags incredibly, the story just isn't there, virtually nothing happens for the first 70 minutes or so. Ahh, this movie just completely stinks.\n\nThe other star I give for it's stars. Though this a definite low point for everyone concerned they do their jobs well. Dennis Quaid is always likable and I've always liked Simon MacCorkindale somewhat, got used to seeing him in Falcon Crest, I recall. Or was it Dallas?, hell, I don't know. And finally Louis Gossett Jr. plays his ridiculous role well, only one year after picking up the Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. This would be like Russell Crowe going from A Beautiful Mind to Dude, Where's My Car."

So many future stars are in this that it has to stand to good reason that this isn't a terrible movie. taking the killer shark out of Amity is something refreshing and new and unlike Jaws: The revenge Jaws 3 packs an actual punch. there are a few surprises in this movie that I wont give away but the switch up from fisherman and a police chief chasing a giant killer shark in the ocean is very refreshing. If you can get the 3-D version its even better but the plan ol' part 3 will do the trick. if you like sharks this is the movie for you. Jaws 3 delivers."

It was just a ripoff of the original and all it's clones. If the tape had been in 3-D I might have been more alert.\n\nThe only good thing that I can say for the film is that if you can't go to Sea World you can at least get an idea of what it is like from this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "3D films have something of a dubious reputation for being bereft of creative energy or merit. How long they have had this reputation for, I do not know. If they did not have such a reputation before 1983, they certainly earned it then. After Friday The 13th Part 3, all the 3D film needed was another crapfest to give it a reputation as being a cover for a bad story or script. They got it in the form of Jaws 3-D, which not only ranks as one of the worst films I have seen to date, it also ranks as one of the worst 3D films I can remember. And I include 3D shorts from theme parks in that list.\n\nAs with all films that have 3D photography, the big make-or-break point is the 3D effects. Where Friday The 13th Part 3 did at least a reasonable job with this effect, Jaws 3-D is a spectacular crapfest with its effects, too. Given that both films were shot using the same process, ArriVision 3D, the blame for this lies solely with the director. Underwater shots are hideous in appearance, with enough grain and diminished focus to leave the audience wondering what in the blazes is going on. A lack of detail in dark spots of the picture is often characteristic of films that were shot in the early 1980s and previous, but many of the underwater shots show no effort at all to alleviate this problem. Those who have seen Blade Runner will know this is not impossible. In fact, a few stage lights in the right places could have worked miracles during the underwater/nighttime shots.\n\nThe acting is thoroughly wooden, but I cannot help blaming the director for this, too. Given that the cast includes such B-list dependables as Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr., one would at least expect to be able to coax a halfway decent performance out of them. Especially considering that the things they are reacting to existed right on the set with them. Sadly, Quaid looks like he is ready to ask if he is meant to be scared yet, and Gossett Jr. looks like he's ingested too many painkillers. Mind you, these are the best performances that the film has to offer. You will be hard pressed to name two other actors from the film or the characters they portrayed.\n\nTo the film's credit, there are no ridiculous scenes where the shark roars or explodes for no readily apparent reason. While the photography does much to make the equivalent scenes in Jaws 3-D nonsensical, they do make sense if you pay attention. Unfortunately, the ridiculous 3D effects will also leave you chuckling. The moment when the shark explodes, and its teeth come flying at the screen, is a priceless moment of unintentional comedy.\n\nThis is where it all comes crashing down, unfortunately. The original Jaws was made on a very tight budget, and its director realised that he could not rely on effects to carry the day. He therefore decided to focus upon the human element, and filled his cast with the best cheap talent he could get his hands upon. Whether it was his direction or their ability, the performances manage to keep the viewer focused upon something other than the cheapness of the effects. Although you might forget the name of the characters, you won't forget the men who played them in a real hurry. Which is exactly the problem here. As in Alien 3, the characters are unmemorable because they don't have anything remotely approaching a second dimension.\n\nI gave Jaws 3-D a one out of ten. As a serious horror or drama, it sucks dead bunnies through a straw. As a comedy, it works better than the Marx Brothers at times. Jaws: The Revenge was so bad it was incredible. Jaws 3-D was so bad that it is legendary."

It stars Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Simon MacCorkindale, Louis Gossett Jr, John Putch & Leah Thompson. The second sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws, this was originally released in the 3D format that had a brief rebirth in the early to mid 1980s. Plot centres around a WaterTheme Park coming under attack from a great white shark.\n\nIt was originally mooted to have been a spoof movie, along the lines of Airplane et al, now that could have worked you feel, what we actually get is an unintentional spoof movie that was made in appallingly bad 3D. Yet the 3D gimmick was enough to get the punters into the cinema and keep those tills kerchinging to the point where Universal Pictures were rather happy. Happy enough to green light another sequel, the god awful Jaws: The Revenge in 1987. As I was one of those punters who shelled out for the 3D Jaws experience back in the day, I feel partly responsible for part 4 assaulting the eyes of everyone who has ever seen it.\n\nWatching it now over 25 years later in 2D, the film is actually worse than I originally remember it being. Of course now in this internet age we can find out about the numerous script tamperings that went on with it, and subsequently look at the non directing career of Alves post this fishy garbage and fully understand why. Perhaps the biggest mystery of all is how Messrs Quaid, Gossett Jr & Thompson survived to have careers afterwards? But the reality is it's not their fault, Quaid is badly underwritten and a bit too fresh faced to carry the male lead role this early in his career, Gossett Jr actually does OK in the role of SeaWorld park manager Calvin Bouchard, showing the only moments of acting gravitas as he tries to keep things under control. While Thompson is a third arc character called on to look pretty and say a couple of lines whilst trying to keep a straight face.\n\nEven if we shy away from the poor effects work, that were, yes, poor effects even in 1983, Jaws 3 has an amateurishness about it that is laughably bad. The shark sequences look like they were filmed in a bath tub with some kiddies drawing used to scale, while the dialogue, too, seems to have been lifted from a 4 year old's memoirs. Then there is the performances from the likes of Armstrong and MacCorkindale, the former is bland beyond compare, the latter is, if you pardon the pun, wetter than a fish's blanket. There's some decent choreography on show for some water skiing sequences, but even these are countered by the ineffective use of the shark. Don't believe anyone who tells you that this is still fun in a popcorn no brain kind of way, it isn't. It's as bad as its reputation says it is and it's only saving graces are Gossett Jr and that it isn't as bad as part 4. 2/10"

Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. deserved a better script. The use of 3-D is very forced that it's ridiculous; for example, when the shark crashes the underwater installations you can't help but laugh. I can't believe Louis Gosset Jr. was forced to act \"scared\" in that scene. For example, the 3-D system used in Friday the 13th part 3 (1982) is way better than this and that's something to say!\n\nJAWS 3 is another unnecessary sequel that only demonstrates how big movie companies got rich because of the popularity of the Horror genre.\n\nThere is nothing good to say about this one expect for some cheesy shark action. Please, avoid it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just when you thought it was safe to go to Sea World.... Oh, never mind! JAWS was an excellent franchise that had one thing in common: a shark eating people! The tradition remains in this third installment, but something is terribly wrong here! Universal had a bad pre-Y2K glitch when they released HALLOWEEN 3 with different elements not pertaining to the original series. Later, the new JAWS movie was put out only to convince folks that it wasn't the same thing again. The result probably was beyond disappointment.\n\nHere's what I believe happened to JAWS 3. Alan Landsburg Productions actually created a killer shark movie not relating to the JAWS theme. Universal had a past history of suing film studios in releasing rip-offs similar to their patented work. Letting the giant movie studio release ALP's production was obviously the safest bet in avoiding a lawsuit. A few people may have remembered a poverty row studio called Film Ventures International, who released a movie in '82 called GREAT WHITE for about a single weekend, only to have banned future showings as a result of a court order involving plagiarism.\n\nMy advice to movie buffs is to remain committed to the original JAWS film released in 1975. The sequels bare no resemblance to Steven Spielberg's art of moviemaking."

The acting not so great either. The 3-D effects fall flat. But c'mon- it's harmless rainy afternoon kind of fun.\n\nDennis Quaid is hot in this film. As is John Putch. WOOF! Bess Armstrong is beyond annoying. Then again she always is. This film introduced me to Lea Thompson (one of my favorite actresses ever!!). Loved her ever since and have seen 99% of anything she has been in. \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" is another classic. Damn she was so fragile and beautiful in that film. You just want to protect her character from the crap around her.\n\nJaws 3 has a female ski team, the co-ed ski team- all being attacked by the shark. Though very little chomping takes place. *SIGH* That was disappointing. They should have included a high body count in this one. Including a chomp on Louis Gossett Jr.'s character. Hated him. I love the original movie poster. Which I got from ebay. The covers for the DVD releases of 2 - 4 suck.\n\nEven though the real fun doesn't start until the moment that \"some shark's mutha!!\" starts attacking Sea World \"above and below the surface of the water\"- I will love this film forever!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Having been one of the unlucky people who saw this movie in 3D on it's original release, thought I would take a moment to comment on it after seeing it on the worst films list. At this writing, it ranks number 49, but is probably worst than that. Believe me, even the 3D effects such as they were didn't help this turkey and it's amazing that the career of any of the actors involved survived it. Well, some of their careers didn't, as Bess Armstrong and Simon MacCorkindale went on to do bad television series and/or miniseries.\n\nThough you may never have a chance to experience the film in 3D take my word for it when I tell you that you didn't miss anything. The 3D effects were minimal, for example, in most scenes the shark was too big for the 3d effect to work, and other than some splashing water, and one floating fish head, there wasn't any sense in even bothering with filming it in 3D. On top of this, never has the audio in a film been as bad as this one. There are times when you have to strain to hear any of the dialogue. Then again, you probably wouldn't want to hear it so you're better off.\n\nI suppose I could talk about the acting, but there isn't any. The worst offender here is Louis Gossett Jr. who should have known better. He spends most of the film shouting mumbled dialogue which is totally unintelligible, as if he were in a hurry to get his part over with so he could leave the studio lot as quickly as possible without being seen. He must have had some foresight into the big stinkeroo this legendary dead fish tale would become.\n\nThe film must have made some money though. That's why we were next subjected to Jaws IV, which goes onto prove that Carp is Carp, no matter what number you put behind it.\n\nAs for any excitement and suspense, my advice is for you to open a can of Star Kist. That would be more thrilling than this mess, and take up a whole lot less of your time. Or better yet, just watch a Charlie Tuna commercial if you want to be entertained. Till Next time\n\nNext Class Please"

Aside from the fact that talented actors and actresses like Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong and Louis Gossett Jr. appear to be desperately trying to make a really bad movie at least average, the horribly cheap special effects (i.e. the sharks) just make this one stink on ice.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the only movie I have ever walked out on in my life. I think whoever titled this movie gave it too much credit - this movie was 1 dimensional (at best). The plot? Shark kills somebody in a bedlam of blood and gore, shark kills someone else, then someone else, ad nauseum.\n\nI really can't figure out what went wrong here. The director and writers were part of the original Jaws, so it would seem they are capable of creating something of value. What happened? Let's take a closer look: It seems that this is the only film Joe Alves has EVER directed! Well, thank goodness he won't be releasing anymore of this toxic sludge upon the world of film. Writer Peter Benchley, writer of the original Jaws, was a writer on this film as well. A closer look at his writing history reveals him as a writer on: Jaws, The Deep, Cruel Jaws, The Beast, Creature (White Shark)... Hmmm, I detect a theme here. Peter Benchley is the Mario Puzo of shark movies. Another writer on this film was Carl Gottlieb. It seems like 1983 was a bad year for Mr. Gottlieb, because the same year this sludge was written, he also wrote the bomb known as \"Dr. Detroit\". This director of \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" seems to actually have a better career as an actor than a director, appearing in such films as \"Johnny Dangerously\" and \"Clueless\". Aside from the Jaws films he only wrote on 4 movies.\n\nThis overwhelming evidence seems to prove only one thing. Stephen Spielberg was the only production talent on Jaws, and without him and the high-caliber actors of the original film, hacks like Peter Benchley and his band of cronies will never create another watchable film again."

However, the manager (Louis Gosset Jr.) makes a careless decision and the shark dies. Within hours, the shark's mammoth-sized mother has arrived on the scene for bloodthristy revenge.\n\nDan, on the previous page, clearly stated the mystery of Carl Gottleib, co-writer of Jaws and Jaws II, coming up with this idea. Actually, it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like Quaid and Gosset Jr. But, it turned out to be a thumbs-down. The film is daft and unexciting and relies more on blood and guts coming out of the screen than on suspense. The shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at Amity, it looks fake, roars and swims (or rather crawls) at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness. But, of course, its just a model and so the direction is really to blame.\n\nFortuanately, its quite fast-paced so watching it doesn't really do any harm. Its just a big shame that Joe Alves has taken things so far off the rails."

The story in this one is that Dennis Quaid plays the now adult son of Roy Scheider, whom played the police chief in the first two films. Quaid takes a job working at Sea World in Orlando, and begins to strike up a romance with Bess Armstrong, a dolphin trainer and biologist at the water park. A maintenance worker gets mangled and killed in a late night attack by a baby great white. When the young shark is discovered, it is captured with plans to exploit it for more tourist dollars. Then the baby dies. And momma gets ticked. Very ticked. When Momma shows up, I have to say that the deaths are done well. Especially the poor guy whom gets chewed up, and we see (and hear) the carnage from WITHIN momma shark's mouth.\n\nThe rest of the movie follows Quaid, Armstrong, and a few other noteworthy thespians such as Lou Gosset Jr., and Lea Thompson, as they try to outwit the momma shark's vengeful streak.\n\nThis movie was released in the middle of the 3-D revival of 1983, and several scenes are effective (the floating arm comes to mind), but many are just window dressing (the submersibles), or just painfully goofy (the shark approaches the camera head on, but DOES NOT swish it's tail back and forth as it swims. The shark looks like a plastic toy moving on a track!)\n\nJust forget the earlier two films, and just turn your brain on auto-pilot, and you'll enjoy this film just fine.\n\nI just have one question, to anybody whom may know... When I first saw the film in the mid 80's on BETAMAX (!!!), the title logo of \"JAWS III\" was animated in a cool red and yellow 1950's scifi lettering style, and they \"chomped\" at the viewer to the accompaniment of a rocket-like swooshing sound and a loud CHOMP!!!\n\nViewing a videocassette made in the mid 90's, the swooshing sound is there, the CHOMP sound effect is there, but the cool 3-D animated logo is gone. It is replaced by a still frame of \"Jaws III\".\n\nThat opening gripped me when I was a kid... where did it go?"
