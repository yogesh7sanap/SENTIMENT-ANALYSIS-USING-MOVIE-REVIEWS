        "review_detailed_main": "Obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie, so don't even look at the credits at the end, you'll only hold it against them. Nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed out after 10 minutes, and they were the lucky ones. The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien. The creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you don't pass out, you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film. The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this. If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store. If there's any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad, I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking \"Where is this happening? What's going on?\" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. This was happening, now that's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine bucks though."

It almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film. I can't go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.\n\nTo start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. On top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type.\n\nAll in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, I know that I got a kick out of it, I mean lets all be honest here, sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others."

After helming the appalling 'House of the Dead' director Uwe Boll has now cast his less-than-talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation. Don't these guys get it? To anyone who can't understand, here it is in block capitals for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES! The acting here is, at best, sub-standard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which did have its scary moments) the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace. Pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored. Why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets. Avoid at all costs."

Matters are made even more incomprehensible with a prologue that occurs '22 years ago' but which segues into the present day and proceeds to introduce even more mind-bogglingly random elements to ensure that even the most astute of viewers will be completely baffled.\n\nAs the film progresses, more and more nonsensical garbage is haphazardly thrown into the mix, Boll's pointless directorial stylisms making everything impossible to follow, with the occasional voice-over by Christian Slater (intended to help explain matters) only adding to the embarrassment factor. Ridiculous voice-overs aside, Slater's performance isn't all that bad, but his co-star Tara Reid is absolutely terrible and was clearly hired for her looks (yet she doesn't even have the decency to take off her bra during the obligatory sex scene!).\n\nAfter much frenetic shooting, a smattering of reasonably fun gore, some choice snippets of lousy dialogue ('Some doors are meant to stay shut') and lots of naff CGI creature attacks, during which Boll throws in some lousy Indiana Jones-style adventure and a scene completely ripped off from James Cameron's Aliens (the Xenos\u2014yes the monsters ARE called that\u2014obliterate a team of soldiers, despite the use of automated sentry guns), the film wraps up leaving the viewer none the wiser about what they have witnessed."

        "review_detailed_main": "True, there are many movies much worse then this movie. This movie was no Manos: The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I have seen them both.. twice) but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (Yes, even that movie surpassed this). Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad. Razzie awards lookout, your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This film I'm talking about is of course Alone in the Dark. I'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad.\n\nActing- I'll first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film (next to the ending credits, which played 'Wish I had An Angel', the acting. Christian Slater must be proud of himself, he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze. Though all his awful dialog he had to speak, it made me wonder why he just didn't walk off the set halfway. Perhaps it was because of Stephen Dorff being in the film as well (somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it). Tara Reid is a bad actress but good looking and that's all that really matters in films like these. That is not to say the acting was perfect though, it was average, not good, and perhaps the only thing in the film not good.\n\nThe Soundtrack- Except for 'Wish I had An Angel', the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears, perhaps to disguise the awful story (something I will get to soon). A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged.\n\nThe Directing- Directed by Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Telling us \"Yes, movies can get this utterly bad and that's just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies\". At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball. Without being told I would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked. The director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall. On the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action, the camera stops for some reason.\n\nThe Producing- Who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb? I pity the fool... sometimes. Sometimes I'm glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag.\n\nThe Writing / Storyboard- Trying to Analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with it right after but I will still attempt it.\n\nEdward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted (this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud). Then it fast-forwards many years later where he's a paranoia detective. He get's attacked by some zombie that can't be shot to death, kills it and moves on with life. Later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows.\n\nYeah, the plot is bad, really really bad. The film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes, which felt like 100, of random text about an untrue civilization called the Abskani. The film goes not to have one twist after another, more then the audience can handle, more then the audience wants to handle, more then the audience could ever care about. This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon does better.\n\nOverall, miss out on this movie. I gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0."

        "review_title": "Well . . . it's not predictable",
        "review_detailed_main": "I usually start by relaying the premise of the film, but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review, let me preface it by saying that I'm someone who likes most films (just check my other reviews). Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll, whose film right before this one was House of the Dead (2003). Like Alone in the Dark, it was also a film adaptation of a video game. Almost everyone hated it. Well, I loved it. I even gave it a 10 out of 10! My point in stating this (which will surely turn some readers off immediately) is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark, there must be something wrong with it.\n\nThe Premise: Who am I kidding? Attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the United States' budget, but here it goes anyway. Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe. The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the \"second world\", which was evil in nature. The bad stuff wiped them out, but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key. Later, some scientist/government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal, and specifically this tribe, decided to experiment on some kids, to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world. (Believe it or not--everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film--it's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice-over also reading it to us). Then, there was something about the kids being in an orphanage, but the government takes them back out, and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics, and there are super humans roaming around, and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on.\n\nIn fact, the exposition never really stops. It's like a neverending backstory from hell. There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films, maybe 25. But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film. In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans, we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf, worms that invade your body and turn into snake-like aliens, tunneling worms underground, zombies, Starship Trooper-like wars, evil scientists, underground lairs, gold mines, spooky warehouses, impalements, big mostly unused museums, government conspiracies, golden trunks pulled out of the sea, nuns, explosions, complex backstabbing plots, a very ambiguous romance, car chases, home invasions, kitchen sinks . . . wait, I can't remember if that last one was in the film. Even more amazingly (amusingly?), in Fangoria #240, producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying, \"We're spending much more time on story, being very meticulous about that\". Tara Reid called Alone in the Dark \"a smarter film\".\n\nLet me not mislead anyone. A lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film, but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else. I usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting, why we were there, or what anyone was doing (at least when each scene began). It's just a random mishmash of settings and clich\u00e9s, as if director Uwe Boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers. Then when he was done, he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice, then reassembled it by throwing the I Ching. Sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel (which is a combination of short, varied, unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work), but perhaps that's being too generous. I'm not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel.\n\nJust as I tend to at least like most films, I tend to like most actors and most performances. It's very rare that I say that a performance was bad. Well, Tara Reid was bad here--and I'm someone who usually likes Reid. I don't know what happened. For a large percentage of the film, they just move her around the set like a prop. They might as well have just bought a blow-up doll. That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings. Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining mother-in-laws.\n\nAnd speaking of that dialogue, a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla. By that, I mean that it's a lot of pseudo-scientific gobbledy-gook. At least in Godzilla films, there's a campiness to it, because they know how ridiculous it is, and there's a big payoff in that we get to see Godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something.\n\nJust what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here, besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents, is difficult to say. I can't say that I thought anyone in the film had a decent performance, although maybe Slater at least saw the cigar. I think that's unprecedented for me.\n\nStill, I didn't give this film a 1. There was some competent cinematography, even if Boll and Schwadel made mincemeat out of it, and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good. Heck, even the novelette prologue wasn't so bad. I actually thought the film had promise at that point. But this may just be the worst film I've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whenever people think of Uwe Boll, they think of all of his films that can be considered bad. (If not terrible) And the film that most people point to as one of his worst is the 2005 release \"Alone in the Dark.\" (Heck, it's the one I've seen many claim to be THE worst film he's made... and others claim it to be perhaps one of the worst films of all time.) It's the one that seems to get the most attention. The most publicity. And of course, the most hate.\n\nI'm not in that camp, though. Oddly enough. In fact, I'd be willing to argue that despite being a fairly terrible film, \"Alone in the Dark\" to me is arguably one of his best video-game-to-film adaptations. Something about it comes off as borderline \"So bad, it's good\" to me. And I honestly found it to be perhaps the best-directed film in his entire filmography, at least from a visual/composition standpoint.\n\nThe film follows paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), as he struggles against various otherworldly threats, including deadly creatures, underground caverns, the delusions of a mad scientist, and other forces. At the same time, he reconnects with an old flame (Tara Reid) and comes to odds with government Bureau 713 and a former comrade. (Stephen Dorff.)\n\nThe acting is... well. You know. ...bad. Slater is trying and seems to be having a blast, but he's still quite wooden. Reid is amusingly-bad in her attempts to come off as smart and serious. Dorff is probably the best, giving the only performance that seems SLIGHTLY decent. (Though still both over-done and under-done depending on the scene.) And supporting characters are all around the level of \"meh.\"\n\nThe script is a fairly incomprehensible mess. From scene to scene, you can't really grasp what's happening, what's relevant (or irrelevant), what character motivations are, etc. There's a lot of bizarre leaps in focus and there isn't really any clearly defined focus or main conflict. The film seems to be made up of various meandering subplots that don't quite fit together. In addition, the cinematography is bland. The music is sub-par. Effects range from \"excellent\" (some early bullet-time effects, while tacky, are very well-executed) to \"awful.\" (Some of the creature effects being laugh-out-loud bad.) And there's a lot of little issues here and there throughout the production and presentation.\n\nThis SHOULD be a 1 out of 10 film for sure. But there's just something about it. I just can't bring myself to give it that score.\n\nIn part, it's because I do honestly believe that this is one of Boll's better films. And I believe that here, he shows off perhaps the best visual direction of his entire career. It actually has a few really cool shots that are well-composed, there's at least some creativity shown (even though it doesn't work) through attempts to be moody or exciting with key sequences, and it has the most style out of anything he's really done. Don't get me wrong... the film still isn't particularly well-directed. But it seems to have the most effort put in by Boll out of any of his films. It isn't cheap and rushed like \"House of the Dead\", nor overly \"gritty\" and sloppy like everything he's done lately. It looks the most like an actual decently-budgeted movie out of all of his films.\n\nIn addition, something about this movie strikes me very-much as a great example of \"so bad, it's good.\" Whether it be chuckling at lazy attempts to make characters look smart (giving Tara Reid glasses, for example), or poorly-executed action beats... I find this film very likable and entertaining because of how bad it is. And that counts for something.\n\nI think that this is definitely not Boll's worst film at all. I don't even think it's in his bottom-5. I found it amusingly bad, and with a surprising amount of style and effort. And that effort alone makes it better than much of his other work.\n\nI give this a very-bad 3 out of 10. Fans of bad movies (like me) should definitely give it a shot. You just might find it entertaining!"

There was a golden opportunity to make a series of increasingly stupid films based off of rip-off xenomorphs climbing out of the shadow realm! Still, if they had done this we probably wouldn't have Stranger Things, and Reid got to take part in the Sharknado series eight years later anyway, so maybe it's for the best this never went any further!"

It utterly disgraces the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film-making.\n\nDoctor Boll, if that is indeed what you are (I'm thinking proctology here), what on Earth are you doing in a director's chair?"

There's nothing special about the effects, nor the cinematography, nor the score. Several pointless scenes of mindless, ear-numbing shoot-em-up's that neither moved the plot along, nor offered any entertainment value, whatsoever.\n\nNo one should be subjected to this film, ever, under any circumstances.

And the commentary was better than the movie. So now we rent this guy's stuff just to laugh our asses off with his idiotic musings.\n\nHe actually believes that his movies are works of art!! You'll giggle uncontrollably when you watch Alone in the Dark (and any other Uwe Boll movie) with the commentary. He refers to his ending as \"Lynchian\" (for a reason that the viewer--nor, apparently, the director--can explain. He constantly makes fun of Tara Reid and complains that she doesn't take off her bra. He refers to every shamelessly ripped off scene as an \"homage\". Best of all, he complains that he is a misunderstood genius who has been unfairly criticized on this very site, IMDb. Chances are he is reading this review and others at this moment and plotting about how to incorporate his rebuttals into his next commentary track."

        "review_detailed_main": "It has only been recently that Uwe Boll's seeming masterpiece, Alone In The Dark, has been available here for rental. It completely bypassed local theatres, and was available on DVD in America at least a year before here, which is rarely a good sign. Unlike Boll's previous effort, House Of The Dead, the problem is not so much in the performances or even the special effects. The real problem lies in the direction and editing. Articles have since sprung out of the woodwork describing Boll's inflated self-opinion and inability to work effectively with collaborators. It seems that this includes actors. Reid and Slater do their best with the roles that they have been assigned, but it becomes clear that they are given very little direction throughout the film. At one point, Slater and Reid appear to be running from the Alien-like creatures of the story through a warehouse. To say that they interact very little with their surroundings is an understatement. This scene could have been more convincing, in fact, if they had been running across a floor with a rear-projection behind them.\n\nNo, the real problem in this film lies in the direction and editing. A sex scene appears with no linking into the preceding or following scenes. Adding to the film's woes is that test audiences were so confused by the plot that an opening crawl had to be added in order to make the plot easier to follow. Said plot basically follows Christian Slater, who looks nothing like the Edward Carnby of the video games, as he deals with supernatural creatures emerging in our plane of existence and a government agency attempting to deal with them. Exactly where this plot stems from, I do not know, and I have only briefly played one of the games, but I do not remember any of the embellishments Boll has provided (which telegraph themselves with fervor). Compounding the problem is that Boll requires his actors to describe the plot or the point of what we have seen in the scenes. That none of the plot can be inferred through the images makes Boll's incompetence as a director pretty obvious.\n\nTo hear it from Boll during the featurette, Atari contacted him and asked him to adapt the game into film. The nonsense of this spin is shown by what outsiders have to sayabout Boll and his films. The writers of a rejected screenplay for House Of The Dead decided that they would rather remain in obscurity than become famous for working with Boll. Speaking as a writer myself, this tells me far more about Boll as a filmmaker than a million featurettes from the lousy DVDs made of his lousy films ever could. Adding insult to injury is that Nuclear Blast paid Boll and his cohorts enough money to make an album in order to have a few of their bands included in the soundtrack. If there were justice in the world, Nuclear Blast would be one of the many record labels outselling Sony by a twelve to one ratio. They are innovators, and have released some masterpieces from the likes of Therion or Agathodaimon. That they have to slum it in dreck like this while Sony saturates the market in their repetitive garbage only adds further insult to Alone In The Dark. I hope that thirty grand could be written off easily.\n\nSoundtracks and bad direction aside, the construction of the film is utterly terrible, too. I cannot really describe the ending for fear of ruining what little surprise the film has, but I bet that Uwe was paying very careful attention to the end of Resident Evil. It is a pity he did not learn that such images only work because of the context they are in, and that context needs to make a certain level of sense. I know it sounds hypocritical of me to call for a film to guide the audience through the plot, but at the very least, Alone In The Dark could have given a small breadcrumb trail, anything to make point A follow logically from point B, so to speak. The idea that we are meant to follow all this action going on in such a confined space, and then accept that some survivor got out and destroyed everyone (even the meaning of everyone is left pretty vague in this film) is pretty ludicrous. Others have described the patent unbelievability of Tara Reid as an archaeologist, but this is in fact one of the least of the film's problems.\n\nI gave Alone In The Dark a two out of ten. As a horror film, it is far too tame to horrify. As an action film, it is too stagnant to move the audience. As a serious acting piece, it has no drama to speak of. Without the lousy or idiotic production decisions, it also loses the unintentional comedy that made House Of The Dead bearable. In essence, it winds up in no man's land. See it if you need an example of how one man can be so blind to his own incompetence."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the Atari video game , the film starts with a lengthy opening text . In fact this long prologue was added after several test audience members said they were confused by the screenplay . In 1967 mine workers discovered the first remnants of a long lost native American civilization , the Abkani . They believed there are two worlds on this planet . A world of light and a world of darkness .10.000 years ago , they opened a gate between these worlds . Before they could close it , something evil slipped through . They mysteriously vanished from the earth . Only a few artifacts remained hidden in the world's most remote place . These artifacts speak of terrifying creatures that thrive in the darkness , waiting for the day that the gate can be opened again .Later on , things go wrong when a saboteur breaks a gate and releases the monsters . They go throughout the gate and hell breaks loose . As some scientists , detectives (as Edward Carnby : Christian Slater ) , the beautiful anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) , and agents of the Bureau 713 (led by Cmdr. Richard Burke : Stephen Dorff) of the paranormal slowly unravel mysterious as well as suspenseful happenings with deadly and unexpected results . As a small team of agents to penetrate at an Alien-style complex .Evil awakens. Can mankind defeat the army of darkness unleashed by an ancient evil cult?\n\n\u00a8Alien\u00a8 and \u00a8Resident Evil\u00a8 Sagas are two good terror/action movies with a lot of attributes which this film version regrettably fails to emulate . Players of Atari's original role-playing adventure/terror game will know how terrifying it was . The main issue deals with creepy monsters made in 3D computer generator in which they are freed when a mysterious man makes the mistake of opening up a secret door between two worlds and letting them mayhem shuffle forth . The strange creatures , Alien-alike , take another pasting in the shoot'em up/monster movie rendition based on the famous video game from Atari . As our protagonists battle their way through the carnage before the final confrontation takes place . Breathtaking images , crossfire , spectacular battles and duels and lots of amusement and entertainment ; but being really mediocre , and sometimes embarrassing . And is added a brief love scene between Christian Slater and Tara Reid featuring a wonderful song in background . The efficient set up is not enough for delivering a nice movie , and the picture falls in ordinay topics , cliches and a salad of eerie monsters including various scenes with no much sense .\n\nIt packs an atmospheric but dark cinematography from Mathias Neumann . It contains a thrilling score , and the song that can be heard during the shooting sequence is \"Ghost\" by Mnemic and another famous song sung by Neneh Cherry and Youssou N'Dour during the love scenes titled \"Seven Seconds\" . The motion picture was middlingly made by Uwe Boll who poured a lot of money into special effects ; however , being deemed worst film of 2005 by the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards .All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in several countries , but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. Having directed 25 movies up to 2011, Boll is panned by the critics and he has received lousy reviews. Only recommended to those who amuse those kind of adventure/action/horror films or those enjoy in general of the Uwe Boll cinema .The film will appeal to fantasy/SciFi buffs with action enough to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Terror/fantasy movies genre enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because dash horror , action , fights , shots and adventures are thrillingly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact. Rating : 4 ; below average , though some moments results to be entertaining."

        "review_detailed_main": "The title of worse film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often. Most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates: Plan 9 from Outer Space, Battlefield Earth, and the Adventures of Pluto Nash.\n\nAs I watched the 90 minute bore I found it difficult to even stay awake even while I was trying so hard to laugh at the film. But alas I felt alone in the dark (I was gonna try to avoid the pun but I couldn't resist) as I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Alas my friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the film.\n\nSo... about the film itself. Lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film. The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens (they even call them Xenos), and the creatures in Pitch Black. The can turn invisible at random (and I assure you it is random) and get hurt by light. Also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie. All of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow. People shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post. Light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background.\n\nAnd those were the high points. The story revolving around a paranormal investigator (Slater) whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater Tshirt with a trench-coat and not shaving for 2 days. An archaeologist (Reid) who is rather inept. And a government agent(Dorff) whose lines involve barking order. All three should be ashamed at their performances (not that they have really ever done a good a job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the film I guess. The film contains the single most awkward love scene I have ever seen on film between the two.\n\nThen comes the plot. Quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. The rest is illogical at best. The plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars. The film begins with text and a voice explaining the back-story. This opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible. This opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film. And the ending did not make one ounce of sense. Not only did it not make sense in the world of the film, it simply did not make sense.\n\nFinally the direction of one Uwe Boll. Disgrace, thats all that can be said. His use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense. His lack of direction with the actors. Just watch Reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot. The complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects. And finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers.\n\nI payed a $1.50 to see this show at a second run theater. And while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter I would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film. Grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one.\n\nShame on you Uwe Boll. Shame on you Tara Reid. Shame on you Christian Slater. Shame on you Stephen Dorff. Shame on anyone who was associated with this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This should be my kind of movie. Even if it sucked, it still should have been right up my alley; hell, I like \"Congo,\" and \"Allan Quatermaine\" movies. I have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies. Let's go over why I decided to watch this in the first place.\n\n1. Horror/Sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. I'm a big fan of archaeology, and this movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot.\n\nSo this movie had potential, at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do...I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now on to some of the many faults.\n\nTara Reid. Even though the movie as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is truly awful. We're not just talking bad, I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for worst performance of the year. I don't know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. I mean this isn't just bad, it is laughably bad. Oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene.\n\nEven with Reid's performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. I hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the DVD, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time.\n\nThe storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. In his adult life Slater was recruited by some Unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs I zoned out during. The movie starts with Slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a \"Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities.\" I may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea.\n\nThere is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth (no reason given), experiments on children, super demon/alien-human hybrids, \"photonic\" bullets (the demon things can't stand sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone.\n\nJesus, I can't even being to wade through the clich\u00e9d elements. The script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? Oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. I guess he's infected? How did that happen? Oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which \"fuse\" with the spine of their host)Of course, Slater is, like Blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug \"didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock,\" thank god. Oh, and the people with these \"fused\" spines, have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. Yeah we get zombies.\n\nSo lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is.\n\nAlso, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.\n\nNot the very worst thing you'll see, but a truly bad movie."

The production values aren't bad, but self-conscious direction tends to prevent the viewer from being pulled into the story. If you think about it, however, these same generalizations could be made about a lot of movies, some of which have achieved substantial commercial and critical success.\n\nMy rating may be a little generous (3.5 would be a closer value) but I have seen a lot of movies that were worse, and a number that were much worse."

In the beginning of the movie, there is this long ass text scroll that is like if they took the opening Star Wars scroll and made it as boring as possible and guess what... it makes no sense! As for the main star in the movie: Christian Slater, as bad as he was in The Wizard, he is so much worse here. He isn't even trying here. In fact, no one here in the cast is trying. I hope that those checks contained a lot of 0's. Alone in the Dark contains one of Uwe Boll's most annoying trademarks, and that is the awful action sequences. They are all shot in such boring angels, that I almost fell asleep during them. Plus, they are literally shot in the dark so you cant tell what is happening. The special effects in this movie are so bad, even Stephen Sommers would say \"Damn do those effects look bad.\" There are parts so bad I almost felt embarrassed, like in one scene a soldier was supposed to be dead and yet while people are walking away she lifts her head up. I mean, how did that get past editing? Some people say that Uwe Boll is the new Ed Wood, no, at leat Ed Wood had a passion for filmmaking, Uwe Boll on the other hand just doesn't give a crap. I would say that he is the least talented director in Hollywood, but I believe we all know which infamous duo has earned that title(Hint hint: They directed Vampires Suck and Disaster Movie)."

I really enjoyed Seed. Some nice gore. Postal was daft but watchable. And Bloodrayne 1 was ok. Then we come to Alone in the Dark. Not a gamer so not bothered about anything related to it. Christian Slater does a good Constantine impression whilst Tara Reid ........very bad actress. But the story is quick paces. Some good stunts. Pretty good effects for the time and some good gory moments also (the split head is awesome) So this is far from the worst film ever made. The one out of ten scores are just daft. It's really not that bad. Try watching the sequel to this and tell me it's better!? Ha ha. Nope. Now that IS a stinker.\n\nUwe Bill gets a hard time........he dies make some awful films. Blubberella !? Films that make you want to cut your eyes out. But this isn't one of them.........\n\nHe does a far better than than many films I've seen and better than all of the people that moan about him."

The characters in this film have MORE swagger, bravado and spout more macho bull-crap dialog than you'd find in 10 bad action films combined! Seeing Christian Slater and the rest spitting out their lines with such ridiculousness really, really got on my nerves--especially since, like it or not, these folks AREN'T exactly the action hero types. Such swagger and manliness just seems very ill-placed and dumb. And, speaking of dumb...whose idea was it to feature Tara Reid as a brainy scientist?! I think Carrot Top or Barney the Dinosaur could have carried off a bit better! Some keys that this is a horrible film were the phrases \"based on a video game\" and \"Directed by Uwe Boll\". If you see either of them, avoid the film. If you see both, assume it is, or soon will be, in IMDb's Bottom 100 list! Dumb, pointless and obnoxious from start to finish."

I wanted to do the same thing, but after watching this film, I went to my doctor and he told me that I was now mildly retarded. He didn't know I had seen this movie the night before, so he ran a bunch of tests and kept saying \"I just don't get it...\" over and over, but that is a story for a different time.\n\nAll I can say is that whatever this movie is supposed to be, it isn't. Was it supposed to be scary/suspenseful? Maybe, if your idea of scary/suspenseful is coming downstairs as a little kid on Christmas morning to see if you got a brand new bike, and instead you find your father naked and he throws strawberry jelly in your face and punches you in your nutsack. Confused? So was I when I watched this movie.\n\nWas this film supposed to be a horror film? Oh, it was a horror. Kind of like if your Mom wanted to scare neighborhood children on Halloween, so she put on a devil mask and painted bullseyes on her nipples and had the kids shoot her in the tits with BB guns. Would that be horrible? Sure would, just not in the way it was intended to be. Kind of like this movie; its not a horror movie, its a horror of a movie.\n\nAbout 3/4 of the way through the movie I inexplicably started beating my girlfriend. That's right. This film was so bad it made me an abuser. It has also been traced as a root cause of alcoholism, epilepsy, dick cancer, and gingivitis. Oh,. and Stepehen Dorf is in it, so what did I expect? That guy is a no-talent ass clown."

And Hollywood will keep giving him money as long as they get their money back with a little bit of profit. That's how it goes in Hollywood. They don't care if a film is good or bad as long as they make money of it.\n\nIf you watch his films just to see how bad they are so you can tell other people you are an idiot. If you watch his films to have a good time laughing at the bad dialogue or crappy acting/directing you are like me... A B-Movie Lover. It's nothing to be ashamed over. I love crappy funny movies.\n\nI can't say his films are good but there are definitely worse directors and there are a whole lot of worse movies than Uwe's. Maybe not in the same \"budget\" class but still. He seems to make the money back to the producers and that's all that counts in the end for him to keep making them.\n\nThose who watch His films so they can spread the word about how bad they are: It's like going to McDonalds and eating every week and then complaining that McDonalds have the worst food ever? It's stupid and pointless. And if someone ask you why you eat at McDonals all the time you would answer:\n\nJust so I can tell everyone else how bad their food are...\n\nSTUPID!!!\n\nOh, and by the way.

        "review_detailed_main": "Some of the hatred for this film has been exaggerated. Sometimes people like to have something to rag on no matter what - right now, for the Internet film community, it seems to be Uwe Boll - and judging from quotes I've read by him, as well as movies I've seen, he deserves a lot of it.\n\nBut some of the hatred goes too far. \"BloodRayne\" was already on the IMDb Low 100 before it even really got launched into theaters.\n\nI'll give you an example of the exaggeration regarding this film: One critic I read claimed the opening narration went on for nearly ten minutes, however it lasts perhaps a minute at the most.\n\nThe dialogue is pretty bad, and the beginning with Christian Slater telling a young child on a plane that his mother is wrong about being afraid of the dark is unintentionally hilarious. There are other gems such as, \"Looks like a dead end up ahead. I better take a look.\" Or how about Tara Reid - a supposed archaeologist (hah!) - referring to Newfoundland as \"New Found Land.\" I read here on IMDb that Reid was invited on Jay Leno and wasn't even able to give a definition of her profession in the film.\n\nChristian Slater I pretty much just felt sorry for throughout the film - he's such a good actor and his resorting to crap like this and \"Hollow Man 2\" is a real shame. I am still hoping he makes a comeback. For what it's worth his performance here actually rises above the laughable material.\n\nThe special effects are pretty bad, but once again not nearly as bad as I was expecting after reading some message board posts here.\n\nOverall I was expecting something so bad I would have a fun time laughing at it. Unfortunately this film is not laugh-out-loud bad, it's just plain BAD. It's not the worst film ever made - it's not on par with Ed Wood - it is actually just equivalent to most Z-grade straight-to-video flicks out there. If Boll's name had not been attached to the project and it hadn't attracted a theatrical run, I'm sure it would have a slightly higher rating on here and less of a \"fan base\" so to speak.\n\nI'm not supporting the film or saying it's remotely good - it isn't - but I am saying it's about as bad as any other straight-to-video horror garbage.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it because I didn't even have a fun time watching it for giggles - it's just a really lame film that takes itself way too seriously and perhaps its only positive attribute is that it has some amount of (admittedly ripped-off) style."

Many of them are pictures of Christian Slater locked in a single facial expression, accompanied by flat, monotone narration. The film contains characters, as well as dialogue, a love interest, a conflict, and a resolution. There is an antagonist and a protagonist, sets and props, and scenes in which things occur. Then there's an ending which features credits. Not the tiniest scrap of a plot to be had.\n\nIt appears they made an attempt at a story involving a mad scientist trying to resurrect demons that wiped out an ancient race of people (why?); a young Slater escaped from his experiment and got electrocuted or lost his memory or something. Now the demons have been unleashed and Slater is their main target. I think. The movie suggests it. There then follow endless scenes of people walking around stealthily with their guns drawn, and a major plot point is made out of how cool and buff Slater is. Then I think Tim Conway pops in and insults him while giving him tips on golf... wait, what?... Oh, now it's *Stephen* Dorf? Well, I don't know anymore. I feel like Boll came into my living room for 96 minutes and just sat on my head.\n\nColeman Francis lives, and his name is Uwe Boll! 1/10"

However, director Uwe Boll has brilliantly deconstructed this genre and cloaked it in the guise of Alone In The Dark.\n\nThe first 3/4 of the movie is devoted to setting up the conventions of the genre - invisible monsters, secret government organizations, the lone wolf investigator (brilliantly underplayed by Christian Slater), the implausibly attractive assistant (Tara Reid at her most self-aware). The setup, akin to Sondheim's Into The Woods, establishes conventions which the second part of the movie gleefully deconstructs. The last quarter of the movie turns all previous convention on its head, willfully ignoring its own rules and exposing the entire genre as the mindless pablum that it is - all while confusing the audience to such a degree that we are left with no alternative but to reject the overt meaning entirely and grasp at the underlying substance - which, as Boll masterfully renders, is nothing. He even taunts the audience with clues as to his actual intent - Reid's obviously intentional mispronunciations, climactic fights which end with non-exploding grenades, Stephen Dorff's entire performance. The simultaneous construction/deconstruction of the movie could be accomplished by no one save an artist on the level of Dali, which Boll undoubtedly is.\n\nTen out of ten."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was inevitable that I'd get around to seeing a Uwe Boll film sooner or later. The German director is widely regarded as a modern day Ed Wood, incapable only of churning out a string of god-awful genre flicks packed with bad acting, worse effects and a complete lack of talent. ALONE IN THE DARK is the title of a popular PC game that went on to spawn sequels and remakes on plenty of other computers and consoles, and this is the filmic adaptation. And it's a pile of pants.\n\nYou know you're off to a bad start when the opening scrolling text begins. And then goes on. And on. And on. Basically there's more story condensed here than in the rest of the film, and that's because test audiences left confused, wondering what the heck the film was about, and the opening scroll was tacked on afterwards. Then, to my surprise, things got cheesy and quite a bit of fun. We meet up with Christian Slater, playing a muscular, vest-wearing hero type, and watch his encounter with a superhuman skinhead who leaps great heights and takes bullets with seemingly no pain or effect. Boll's direction is hyper and wannabe stylish, and this sequence is a hoot.\n\nThen things get really bad, with a muddled story about an evil professor, a museum relic that comes to life and a tactical unit of wannabe SWAT guys fighting monsters. The monsters are bad \u2013 half the creatures seen in HELLBOY, half THE RELIC \u2013 but the slithery worm things that live in people's spines are pretty neat, a nice gross out idea. The film moves on from there with a series of poorly connected set-pieces, all of them predictable and done to death a million times previously. There are explosions, shoot outs and a few mild gore scenes, although one shot of a woman's head split open is pretty near the knuckle.\n\nI find it difficult to dislike Slater. He has this nice guy persona in every film I've seen and he seems slick and cool here. Even the bit of crumpet on his shoulder (AMERICAN PIE's Tara Reid) isn't too irritating. Then there's Stephen Dorff, who I last saw in the awful haunted house movie COLD CREEK MANOR, and he isn't bad either, playing a hard-ass commander. Maybe Boll is better at directing actors than he is at directing stories.\n\nAnyway, things play out predictably, and it all washes over you with its inanity and pointlessness. Yes, this is a bad film. Is it one of the worst films ever? I doubt that. It's actually on the level of a Sci Fi Original movie, except with a higher budget. 'Pretty trashy' and 'nothing to get excited about' sum up this film nicely for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "It should come as no shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie. To put it bluntly, it's as if a dung monster defecated, ate the result, and then vomited. The final product would still outshine this movie.\n\nSeemingly based on an ancient (!) Atari video game, the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons, and ancient civilizations. Something about there being two worlds, that of darkness and that of light. (Guess which one's ours.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago a really super-duper advanced civilization opened the portal, demons came over and had a blast, then wiped out the civilization. Which is why we've never heard of them, conveniently enough.\n\nChristian Slater, perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old. He's hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization. Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long-ago civilization. But Carnby believed he wasn't going to be able to find the answers he sought, so he left the group.\n\nBut see, these beasties are out, and they get their prey in varying ways, such as gutting them, splitting them down the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or just turning them into killing zombies. Yes, it's another zombie movie.\n\nThat's about as distilled I can make the plot. It's pretty convoluted and incomprehensible. In similar movies, one might see the intrepid researcher/adventurer figure things out a step at a time, and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher, it's a lot of fun. But when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context... not so much fun.\n\nThe acting is dreadful, save for Slater, who (although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie) showed he was capable of carrying the acting load. He had to; get this - Tara Reid is cast as a museum curator! Honest to goodness, I thought I'd seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here matches Richards, crappy emoting for crappy emoting. Hightlights include Reid pronouncing \"Newfoundland\" as \"New Fownd Land,\" Reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed, throaty monotone (kinda like she'd been on an all-night bender for the past week before filming), Reid - a museum curator, mind you - spending a lot of the movie in a midriff-bearing top and hip-hugger jeans. Oh yeah, she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes. Oh, why must the pretty ones be so dumb? (Note: I don't think Tara Reid's all that good looking. She looks like she's in perpetual need of food.) Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps for Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders of 713. Dorff's character wasn't terribly well developed, but nothing in the movie was, from the sets to the characters to Tara Reid. But I digress.\n\nAnyway, the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace, but director Uwe Boll tosses in a pounding, mind-deadening soundtrack; it's so loud you can't hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes! That can't be right. Given the acting level, however, perhaps thanks are in order to Mr. Boll.\n\nOh, and a fun note. The opening moments of the movie include narration... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You heard that now-familiar Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled. There was surely no need for narration; why do I need some doofus to read what's on the screen for me? Were the producers simply looking out for blind people? Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they were also looking out for hard-of-hearing people. Also, the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl - then lost it. Bizarre.\n\nAlone in the Dark is a loud, dopey mishmash of dreadful acting, an incoherent script, and ham-handed directing. Hardly a note rings true. There's so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise. Even in the dark, the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison.\n\nIronically, since there were only three other people in the theater, I watched this Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way? I can't quite give this the lowest rating, because I had low hopes for it to begin with - and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it. It's atrocious, although Slater redeems himself a tiny bit."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1967, mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named Abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who performed experiments with orphan children. On the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with abilities. When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth. With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.\n\nIn spite of having a charismatic good cast, leaded by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, \"Alone in the Dark\" never works and is a complete mess, without development of characters or plot. The reason may be explained by the \"brilliant\" interview of director Uwe Boll in the Extras of the DVD, where he says that \"videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore\". Further, his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty-five years old. Sorry, but I find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says. Further, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Alone in the Dark \u0096 O Despertar do Mal\" (\"Alone in the Dark \u0096 The Awakening of the Evil\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the survival horror video game series of the same name, \"Alone in the Dark\" stars Christian Slater as Edward Carnby, a paranormal investigator who uncovers a government conspiracy involving ancient artifacts and malevolent creatures. The film's problems are evident from the start:\n\nPoor Writing and Plot: The movie suffers from a disjointed and confusing plot that mixes elements of government cover-ups, ancient civilizations, and supernatural phenomena. The narrative fails to establish clear connections between these elements, leading to a lack of coherence.\n\nInconsistent Pacing: The pacing of the film is uneven, with long periods of exposition interrupted by sudden bursts of action. This disrupts the flow of the story and makes it difficult for viewers to engage with the characters or the plot.\n\nLackluster Acting: Despite having actors like Christian Slater and Tara Reid, the performances are generally subpar. The characters come across as one-dimensional and lack the depth needed to make audiences care about their fates.\n\nUnconvincing Special Effects: The film's special effects, particularly the CGI used to depict the supernatural creatures, are often poorly executed. This detracts from the sense of horror and immersion that the film attempts to create.\n\nAction Over Horror: \"Alone in the Dark\" seems more focused on action sequences than on building a genuinely tense or scary atmosphere. The movie relies on shootouts and explosions rather than psychological horror, which is a departure from the source material and what one might expect from a horror film.\n\nIn summary, \"Alone in the Dark\" suffers from a weak script, unconvincing performances, and a lack of cohesive storytelling, resulting in a film that fails to effectively capture the essence of the survival horror genre."

They were invisible half the time, so it looked like the guys were shooting laser beams at nothing. Plus, the outfits were paintball gear.

You can rarely pin it on one person, and those who do are missing the bigger picture. Regardless, Alone In The Dark did not need to be made. This film should never have been released.\n\nYou watch it. Things happen, with only the most tenuous connection making a plot out of the story. This aspect of the film is so bad that, without the introductory dialog, there would be zero hope of the viewer understanding why these things were happening. So, the core of any successful film is, in my opinion, the story and the plot; there is a story here, but it's ridiculous. There is a plot, but it's too loose to do its job.\n\nYou watch it. You see Christian Slater overacting, stiff and lifeless. You see Brad Doriff, miscast and unnecessary. You see Tara Reid. And seeing Tara Reid is fine in my book, but when she starts talking, the magic is lost. You see bad acting everywhere, bad casting and ridiculous dialog, poor execution and performance all around.\n\nYou watch it. The actual fear from a horror movie is nonexistent; I challenge anyone to describe what truly scared them about this film. The entities that are meant to scare you are nearly void of purpose, poorly designed, digitally executed in a shoddy, video game-esque manner that detracts from the live action film you're watching, and, more than anything, are not scary in and of themselves.\n\nNothing about this film is scary. Nothing about this film is redeemable. For their budget, they could have filmed somebody playing the classic PC game it is \"based on\" (in quotes because, beyond the lead character's name, there is nothing in this movie that relates to that game) for two hours and made a more enjoyable film. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Another smudge on Uwe Boll's credibility, but not even close to being completely his fault."

        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't going to do a review on this movie since I could probably rant about for pages long, but since there already is a second movie out (which is equally, if not more ridiculous then this crap) I thought; why not. This movie was once in IMDb's 'down 100' and it had a perfect spot there, here's why.\n\nI would like to start out with a small introduction to the director of this movie, Uwe Boll. Uwe is a ex-boxer from Germany who spends his time making self-funded (or sometimes government funded) movies based on popular licenses, mostly videogames. Uwe is a man who rather fights his critics then listening to them, and openly admitted that he NEVER played any of the videogames that he based his movies on. Uwe Boll therefore is the worst possible choice to direct a movie based on a video game, and it is as good as hiring a director to do a movie based on a book he never even read. Uwe Boll is compared to the British director Paul WS Anderson a lot of times, but at least Paul WS Anderson creates movies with reverences to the games he based his movies on.\n\nAlone in the Dark is a video game series that I always had a passion for. Its a classic survival horror game that doesn't rely on big and loud gunfights or armies of monsters swarming around. Alone in the Dark is the kind of game that does its title justice; its best played in the dark. The gameplay, the dialog, and the whole mystery of the mansion you roam in has a atmosphere that few games can match these days. Even Atari's latest attempt to revive the Alone in the Dark franchise has shown us that big special effects and good looking graphics aren't everything. But what do we get with the movie? Loud action scenes, corny dialog, paperthin characters and plot... From that point on I just wanted to punch mister Uwe Boll in the face (in pure boxing-fashion) for completely turning a great franchise into a travesty that has literally nothing to do with the source-material.\n\nCarnby looks and acts nothing like the character he is supposed to be playing from the games. Heck, he doesn't even remotely look anything like a detective to begin with, and his overall performance is horrible. There is also little or no explanation about his character, or any other character for that matter. The only thing that matters in this film are the CGI-monsters (that have no relevance to the monsters in any of the games either) and the loud action-scenes (including really tiresome slow-motion effects) and even that is executed very poorly. There is basically no acting in this film, and everyone seems to have only one neutral expression.\n\nIf you by any chance stumbled on this title, I recommend buying or renting the games, especially the first one. When you played that, and then still want to watch this movie you will most probably agree with my frustration. I don't usually 'boycot' any director, since movies are usually a personal piece of art taken from the perspective of the director and producer, but I avoid any movies from Uwe Boll. I don't care if he improves his directing, the lack of humor in his movies, the overall shoddy production, poor characterization and lots of plot holes because I'm not going to watch it. He can direct a modern equivalent of The Godfather for all I care, and I'm still not going to watch it. I'm not going to sit through the crap that he calls film-making ever again. The fact that I even saw this movie TWICE (once alone, once with friends) is something that was a complete and utter waste of my time and I urge anyone to stay away from any movie that Uwe Boll is involved in. He doesn't care about film-making, he doesn't care about story, he doesn't care about the games, he only cares about your wallet."

The plot has more or less been replaced by massive amounts of gunfire and, perhaps as an afterthought, giant dumps of exposition in the form of voice-over monologue. Moreover, the acting is a bit wooden and the dialog is kind of sub par but then again, there are many action movies that suffer from similar problems.\n\nOne major annoyance with this film though is the darkness, yes, darkness would naturally be an integral part of a film called Alone in the Dark but having nearly all the action take place in near complete darkness ruins the film as it makes it impossible to see whats going on; this is especially poignant in one scene where pretty much all the light comes from the muzzle flashes of the guns. The lack of proper characters doesn't help either, in the end you have a bunch of cardboard cutouts that you can't see (due to the darkness) and don't care about, the result of which is and utterly unengaging action flick."

It's a personal insult to the audience.What's even worse it's supposed to be based on two things I somehow hold dear: a) H.P. Lovecraft and b) Alone in the Dark video game series.\n\nThe movie was probably meant to be a rendition of a 4th game in the series (which was also a VERY bastardized version of the original trilogy). The first three games were set in 1920's and involved an middle-aged bespectacled private investigator Ed Carnby who gets involved in some paranormal phenomena. It was all very creepy and atmospheric. The 4th one involved a younger, cooler, kick-a** Ed Carnby who somehow got a serious weapon store at his disposal, brandishing even a laser gun (!). Blah.\n\nAnd now we have a MOVIE version of the WORST part of the video game series. Do we have a case of garbage-in-garbage-out here, ladies and gentleman? Well, no. Uwe succeeded in making bad material infinitely worse. To the point where it makes ABSOLUTE NO SENSE AT ALL. The video game's plot is Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap.\n\nI think the problem lies in the fact Uwe didn't quite get the grasp of English language. For him, \"horror\" means \"lots of SFX and loud soundtrack and explosions and bimbos working as museum curators\". I mean, Tara Reid? What was he thinking? Uwe also thinks that horror movies must include Matrix-like camera work, and basically look like a Britney Spears video. Cos that's like cool and fizzle-wizzle and the kids will dig it,yo.\n\nI'd like to say that this is a movie for younger audience. However, I don't know how young exactly should you be to possibly enjoy this. This movie gives video games a bad name, gives Hollywood movies a bad name, and (what's actually good) makes \"Uwe Boll\" a bad name to have."

I knew this film was going to suck because I alone was there - in the dark. A Spanish group of four people came and sat in the back somewhere, then some white guy sat on the seat. The advertisements started - and then it was time for the movie. I read the forward and decided to run away from the theatre and find another movie and salvage the moment and money into a better movie. I ended up viewing a better movie 'House of Flying Daggers' instead. Reading the reviews of this piece of trash, I made a good decision."

Computer generated monsters and a bad script, not to mention the bad acting, just doesn't cut-the-mustard in this movie. In some ways, if you see nothing interesting to watch on TV someday and this movie is playing on HBO or Showtime, and you have time to waste...hey, drink a few beers and GO-FOR-IT!

What has stuck however is just how awful of an experience this film was, YES that has unfortunately stuck like a hot steaming rancid pile of dog sh!t to the bottom of a fresh sparkling brand new Nike Air Max shoe :(\n\nI'm afraid I will have to carry this film to the grave. It's Uwe Boll movies like this which sometimes make me wish we live in an 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' totalitarian society with the ability to write horrific works like this out of our history forever, but unfortunately for us all this society has not arrived yet.\n\nMy conclusion it that Uwe Boll is still continuing his quest to De-evolve the standards of cinema with yet another super-turkey. If we continue to fund the 'Uwe Boll's' of this world then it is our own fault that we have got the plethora of endless non-stop dreck coming into our cinemas week-in week-out.\n\nTo end this review I will simply say avoid 'Alone in the Dark' like you would avoid a holiday to North Korea.\n\nThat is all.\n\nGoodbye"

The effects are okay - not top notch but its about what can be expected with this kind of budget. While I'm not a close follower of the video game series, I know that there is only very limited similarity between movie and game - i.e. the main character, the title, possibly some plot ideas but thats about it. The game series is based on horror elements mainly, while the movie is 90% action and almost no horror, so if you're a huge fan of the games you'll almost certainly be disappointed, otherwise there's a chance you'll find it okay."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh, Uwe Boll, your name over time has become synonymous with 'bulls*** video game adaptation'. It's all his fault, too; with the exception of Postal, anything that was once a property in a bit-system has been taken by Boll with his Germany tax-credit-shaved dollars (or as he says in Postal with real hilarity, Nazi gold) will be made bad with his style of dull camera-work and unimaginative and uninspired action set pieces. At best he can garner a few points for some bad-movie fun at times, but the product over all is so poorly produced throughout, from its overwrought writing to the mis(or WTF)casting, to simple things like music and weaponry characters use, or the designs of the monsters or whatnot. Case in point, Alone in the Dark, given a 9% out of 100% on metacritic (about the worst critical average one can get without being Paris Hilton), promises to perhaps be something extremely stupid and badly made but fun... and it's ultimately too dull to care at all.\n\nThe plot is so convoluted that you would have to be the biggest slobbering geek for Alone in the Dark the video game (and hell if I know any of them), and it mostly just concerns some paranormal investigator with memory loss and who is an orphan (Christian Slater) teaming up with an archaeologist chick (Tara Reid, who else), and some other prickly paranormal guy (Stephen Dorff) all trying to track some creatures that have escaped from a crypt off of a ship from God knows where over God knows what and blah blah. Yeah, blah blah is a good word to give it, especially with the opening text scrawl going on so long as to make any of the Star Wars opening texts look like log-lines. Honestly, one would come to this at most expecting some cheesy-stupid dialog for the actors to chew on, and even in THIS it's a failure; Slater's narration sounds like it was made at gunpoint via ludes, and Dorff looks confused at to why he's even acting next to Tara Reid. We are too, Stephen.\n\nThe monsters or whatever look cheap even in CGI, the action and gun battles are lazily staged and not exciting, and when it should come time to be \"scared\", the director and his so-called DoP just flicker lights on and off. That's right, your six year old would have more imagination than these clowns. It might not be so offensive except that it's chiefly a time-waster that promises to suck in a fun way. I'm not sure what's more taxing on the audience, that a lot happens and none of it, not an iota, is interesting, or that a couple of actors we might've liked in other films are put through the motions of a script that would barely get by the people at SyFy channel. The ending, by the way, is retarded into such a way that it makes only minimal sense, and then gives an Evil Dead ripoff that is just staggering.\n\nWhile watching the movie Alone in the Dark, I was bored and more engaged chatting with my friends as it went from one big action ramp up to another with the same pale-faced actors and incompetent special effects went along. But thinking and writing about the movie now, it boils me just thinking about going through the experience just for the sake of a few laughs. It's laugh-less. Worthless. Don't waste your time even for the guilty pleasure angle. You'd have more fun flushing your goldfish down the toilet."

Not to mention the sound, music and special effects might in fact cause brain hemorrhage.\n\nHere's an example: somewhere near the middle of the movie, there's a fight scene. It is set in a room which is almost completely black. Almost the entire scene consists of closeups of the various guns' muzzles as they fire, and the camera won't stop shaking. It's completely disorientating and impossible to follow for several minutes, and then the fight suddenly ends (and thankfully the noisy music along with it). That's about as good as it gets.\n\nIn short: this movie is garbage. It's not hard to understand why Uwe Boll has to finance his own films."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the early 90's Atari was Atari, and Resident Evil a twinkle in Capcom's collective psyche. Alone in the Dark, however, having been developed by then upcoming French publisher Inforgrames, was already doing the rounds, busy inventing the third person, variable camera genre that one day would give gamers stuff from the various Res Ev titles to more contemporary efforts like Silent Hill, Devil May Cry and Onimusha.\n\nTherefore to see AITD's movie conversion owing so much to Resident Evil's big screen tenure struck one as deeply ironic. How did the tables turn so? It doesn't really matter, because at least for the first hour, director Uwe Boll's action flick kept its act together by providing solid, rollicking adventure fare with heaps more charm than the last RE entry ever mustered. The film displayed the same smooth execution we saw in Boll's 2004 video game interpretation, House of the Dead, and hopefully serves as harbinger of good news for his helming of another game-to-celluloid metamorphosis, coming attraction Far Cry.\n\nAnyway, AITD the movie had very little to do with its game namesake, since none of the original series' Call of Cthulu Gothic charm made its way through, neither did the misty, almost Victorian locales cross over in the transition. Chief protagonist Edward Carnby has returned, done by Christian Slater in a much needed chance at coming back into Hollywood's limelight-infused embrace. Slater gave a respectable go at doing Carnby, although he decidedly lacked any serious one liners, thus depriving Alone in the Dark serious merit. The producers, to our joy, chose to stick with an R rating by not cutting out the gore and good language, somewhat negating the effects of dry, choppy dialogue segments bereft any memorable moments.\n\nOther characters included archaeologist Aline (Tara Reid) and paranormal investigation Bureau 713 chief Burke Richards (Stephen Dorff). In the story, Carnby, himself employed as detective in all things unreal and spooky, just came back \"to town\" (Vancouver looking a bit too much like Raccoon City) bearing an ancient artifact from a long-lost civilization. Demented professor Hudgens (Matthew Walker) wanted the relic for his world domination scheme, of course, and since he and Carnby shared a sordid past, their paths soon crossed as a chase to get the item in question ensued, taking viewers to several locations. Bureau 713, led by Dorff, stepped in to save humanity from Hudgens' plans, and proceeded to engage armies of creatures known as Xenos in several quite impressive battle scenes as part of the overall plot progression.\n\nAITD looked and felt like a B movie most of the time, adding to its charm, assuming you're forgivingly inclined. Sure, the CGI wasn't up to major release standards, but such minor niggles became easy to ignore amid the film's overall enjoyable content and surprisingly absorbing action. Speaking of which, one had to note a significant amount of attention to detail went into crafting these combat elements, with good set and costume design.\n\nTowards the end things began to fall apart, sadly, and by minute 90 it had all reached a hasty and laughable conclusion, but even so, this one had that unique, shamelessly straight-to-video vibe, the one you perhaps remember longingly from defunct Dolf Lundgren releases and others featured on The Movie Channel's midweek late night schedule. Besides, it had a brief appearance by sultry Hong Kong vixen Francoise Yip (Black Mask), so who's complaining? Better suited to casual movie watchers than hardcore followers of the eponymous series, Alone in the Dark was a light-hearted mix of action and SF horror adequate for a quick caper fix and not too much beyond.\n\nRating: * * *"

Usually when I see a movie I absolutely loathe I might say something like \"one of the worst movies ever\" or \"one of the worst movies I've ever seen\". Not the case this time unfortunately. I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt, I simply can not recollect any movie I've seen (let alone any movie I've seen which was at one point released in theaters) which was worse than this. I don't so much mind that the special effects in this movie aren't even on par with the likes of the boring garbage they send straight to the sci-fi channel. I don't mind so much that there isn't one good performance in this movie. Here's my problem with this movie. We get a 2 minute backstory/ history lesson on the history and culture of an ancient Indian tribe that is nothing more than white letters on black screen. When the movie starts, it has just about nothing to do with anything we just saw. The movie continues like this for the next hour and 40 minutes. it felt like there were like....eight eighths of eight different movies which, just coincidentally had the same cast members, edited onto one film strip. The entire movie is incredibly disjointed and leaves so many plot holes it's unbearable. To me it felt like every scene which moved the \"plot\" forward was just introducing new and random pieces of the puzzle which don't even fit together. Nothing ever ties back to anything. Not to mention the AWESOME slow mo wire work hand to hand fights which look nothing short of ridiculous and out of place and gun fights which use some \"video game-izing\" techniques which would look sub par and stupid on the console video game system that the game of the same name was originally released on.\n\nJust so none of you get it twisted.....I refused to pay money for this movie so i bought a ticket for million dollar baby and snuck in to this.....trust me....go see million dollar baby.\n\nThe only way I can recommend this movie is if you'd like to know what the worst movie all time would look like so that you can appreciate every other movie you'll ever see more."

The plot is superficial at best; the special effects are bad. The actors are flat, as if they checked their brains & emotions at the door in order to endure the pain of making this movie. The action sequences are trite, except for one lengthy epileptic scene remarkable only for its jerky cinematography that completely obscures any actual action that is occurring. It's as if the director (who, in my opinion, should be banned from ever setting foot on a movie set again) took elements from more entertaining action flicks, threw them into a blender until they lost all ability to entertain, and slapped them on screen.\n\nThere may be people out there who enjoy this film, but the entire audience I saw it with trashed it terribly. I strongly advise anyone not to go see this film but to beg Lions Gate not to allow this director (Uwe Boll --who also brought us House of the Dead) to continue with the video game franchise movies he has slated. It seems as if he licenses the franchises based solely on the success of the titles & throws the plot that actually made the games successful out the window. Do not be fooled if you enjoyed the game -- this bears no resemblance to it.\n\nDuring one particularly lengthy Good Guys vs. Creatures shootout, I kept waiting for the equipment to flip over and show Tonka written on the vehicles and for someone to step out of the monster suit.\n\nTruly a travesty that I don't feel ever should have been allowed onto the big screen. Save yourself & go play the game -- you'll have a lot more fun."

This goes on for about 3 minutes, explaining....nothing.\n\nChristian Slater's character is introduced, as an investigator of Paranormal Activity, for an agency run by the government known as Bureau 713. Now, when you hear this, you'd think \"X-files\". No...actually, think more along the lines of \"Crossing guards who tried out for SWAT, and got rejected.\" The organization is compiled of a bunch of scrawny soldiers in skateboarding helmets and paintball vests spouting tactical non-sense and waving hands in the air as if they're trying to give hand signals.\n\nThe story, from what I got, was this: This race of Hell demons came upon Earth, and a mad scientist tried to merge human subjects and the race together. He used 20 orphans as test subjects, and now, twenty years later, he has decided to continue his research.\n\nSomewhere in there fits some crap about an ancient race that tried to contain the deamons....wow, to be honest, I just got totally lost...I'm sorry...and you will too, so don't even bother seeing this. (Recently, movie prices were just dropped in my area...so thankfully I only wasted $10.00 instead of $14.00)\n\nFrom a technical standpoint: There is no plot..the characters are as dry as the turkey I ate for lunch...These \"elite soldiers\", as I said, run around in knee pads, skateboarding helmets, shooting at anything that moves, and even things that don't move..like the sky..or ground. There's one scene that shows closeups of guns firing in the dark for maybe five minutes...the producers didn't do it, but I will for you.\n\nWARNING: THIS FILM MAY CAUSE SEIZURES. VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.\n\nThe movie is just full of poor acting, and what didn't make any sense to me is this: These soldiers flip down their tinted visors...while in the dark...searching for a monster that is entirely black. Whoever wrote this script I am sure is on the street now begging for change.\n\nMy verdict: -17 out of 10"

It focused way too much on the supporting actors, and there was no character development. It was a total bomb of a movie, I was embarrassed for Christian Slater. The story line really made no sense at all.\n\nI don't even understand where they came up with the title. When they were fighting the creatures at Carnby's apartment, it seemed like a really bad music video, and why were they going to his apartment anyway? To get the artifact, key?

The Acting wasn't spectacular but it certainly wasn't as bad of some of Uwe Boll's movies. House of the dead was far by worse. The story was really good, it had me going until the last bit. The action scenes were great. They are very stylized and detailed. Sure it rips of \"The Matrix\" some what, but it does it very well.\n\nThe wardrobes in this movie, must have been picked from a four-year old, however. The Bureau 713 combat suits are obliviously paint ball armor. I mean come on. They're dealing with the PARANORMAL not the semi ad-normal. They should have metal or bullet proof vests on.\n\nThis movie also has enough plot twist that it can get confusing. How ever most of them are reveled within 30mins of the movie. So PAY ATTENTION! Other then that I really don't have that big of a problem with Alone in the Dark. It was decent for a Uwe Boll movie. Nothing more nothing Less. However if Uwe Boll truly put his full potential into this movie, instead of just thinking about getting this movie re-leased in theaters, it could have been a lot better.\n\nHowever I just noticed a sequel is coming out, I don't see why. The ending left a loose end, but not a big one. It really dose not need a sequel. Well, neither did Blood Rayne. But now that's going on to it's 3rd movie. It really does bother me that Companies are trying so hard to get video game movie's out to the fan boys. Alone in the Dark had a lot more potential. Instead they wasted it on a cheap director, but hey. The movie COULD have been great but, Uwe Boll chose mediocre. Still, it wasn't that bad. You should at least give it a try."

Director Uwe Boll is directing another movie that I was interested in called \"Bloodrayne, another video game based movie, and it's due later this year (2005). Obviously, after seeing the trash that is 'Alone in the Dark', I hold absolutely no hopes for any of his past or future pics.\n\nI won't go into the plot, because, well, there really isn't any worth mentioning. Bad action scenes, a run-of-the-mill story, and ridiculous plot holes sprinkle the movie like the cheese that it is. However, I won't give this movie a vote of 1. There are other worse movies then this (I just can't remember any right now). The only saving grace of this movie is that there was an actual production value showing SOMEONE in the Special-FX dept was awake. The CGI wasn't too shabby, and the makeup dept did the job as well.\n\nRemember Christian Slater? Remember him, WAY back in the day in Tarantino's True Romance? How about Interview with a Vampire? Murder in the First? He's a good actor, so what is he doing this for? There was an interesting read by Blair Erickson, who was assigned to write the original script for AITD, but walked out on Boll after doing rewrites. Erickson was so disappointed by Boll's constant harassing him of the script, that Erickson and the rest of the screenwriters walked out. After Boll hired other writers, he then phoned Erickson back, wanting to know if he could use some of his script ideas, WITHOUT PAY. Erickson seemed to have said no, for here is what he said:\n\n\"For those of you who actually give a s***, the original script took the \"Alone In the Dark\" premise and depicted it as if it was a actually based on a true story of a private investigator in the northeastern U.S. whose missing persons cases begin to uncover a disturbing paranormal secret. It was told through the eyes of a writer following Edward Carnby and his co-worker for a novel, and depicted them as real-life blue-collar folks who never expected to find hideous beings waiting for them in the dark. We tried to stick close to the H.P. Lovecraft style and the low-tech nature of the original game, always keeping the horror in the shadows so you never saw what was coming for them.\"\n\nTo me, this sounds like a better script then what Boll used. Which proves to me that Boll is a bad director, and has no eye for a good movie, much less turning a decent script, or at least a decent IDEA of a script into a good movie. After 'House of the Dead', someone should really stop Boll from making movies based out of good video games, or ANY movie for that matter.\n\n3 out of 10"

I just couldn't believe it. It was almost a quest to walk out of the film and have something to hold onto. Like, it was bad but at least the sound track was good. Nope. Nothing in that film was good. Acting? Bad! Story? Bad! Sound? Bad! Cinematography? Bad! Sound Track? Bad! Special Effects? Bad!\n\nI'm discouraged that other people have actually given this film good ratings. They must be family and friends to the cast in crew. All I have to say the only merit this film has, is the idea that at least you can where it like a badge of courage that you managed to watch the whole thing.\n\nI could comment on the story but what story. Can anybody tell me what it was about. I got the idea of the dimensions and Alien looking things and parasites. But the Zombies, the Mad Scientist. I knew I was in for a bad time when the prologue lasted for five minutes and was read by a guy with a lisp. So many things are wrong about this film but I can some up the problem with this. The movie refused to stick to the reality it set forth. I can believe in section 8 or creatures from another dimension. I can believe Tara Reid is a scientist. What I can't believe is that when the creature kill a security guard at the museum where she works and section 8 shows up and explains what is happening that Tara Reid would go back to work like nothing is happening.\n\nSo bad it goes to funny to bad again.

Any attempt to list the inadequacies of this film, or of this director, would take me over the 1000 word limit of IMDb, as well as causing me to dwell on one of the worst films I have ever seen, in my opinion.\n\nIt is films like this one, as well as House of the Dead, that convince people that video games do not adapt will to film. I disagree and think that video games can provide an excellent framework for a good film. Even the best of books will not make good translations to film when the source is totally ignored. When a movie is so drastically different from the source it is based on, with only the title in common, then that ruins the experiences of those that enjoyed the game as well as for those that were looking forward to a decent return on their $7.50.\n\nFor myself, I would like my money back, please, Mr. Boll, as well as the 1.5 hours I just lost.\n\nBy the way, I'd like a new vote scale of 0 (should never have been made). At least with a film rated 1 (awful) there's usually a few good zingers that can be thrown at the film to make it enjoyable. This film does not even provide that."

The movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones; some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, don't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don't show any feelings toward each other. You could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd still be disappointed.

Christian Slater, along with Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff (who gets hardly any time in the movie) walk around shedding their clothes left and right and attempting to act in front of the camera in this wreck of 96 minutes of what a b-movie fanatic might just call a \"movie.\" For everybody else, Alone in the Dark may be that one crapfest out there with enough bad editing, bad dialogue, bad direction, and bad acting to beat Plan 9 From Outer Space's record for worst movie of all time.\n\nDr. Uwe Boll finally proves to us that he is helpless, and even though God himself won't stop him from making movies, he is going to keep making clunkers till somebody shoots him in the head. The problem with him is that he has no taste in film; he thinks everything goes good with Matrix special effects. Someone should tell him that Matrix special effects belong in the Matrix movies, and not in horror video game adaptations. You will constantly see slow moving bullets and time slowing down as people jump through windows and swing punches during fight scenes. These effects cause a lot of money to film. Dr. Boll actually spent more money to lower the quality of his movie. Only he is capable of doing that. And on top of that, the overall creature effects looked like something out my Playstaion 1. The man intentionally made it to seem that way, and further lowered the quality of the movie, of what might of been a good movie if executed properly.\n\nBrendan Fletcher, of Freddy vs. Jason fame, shows up in the movie and impresses the audience with his short but powerful performance as the surfing tax driver. Since when do surfers drive taxi cabs? In Alone in the Dark, they do.\n\nI can go on about how bad this movie is, but I would be just repeating what the other two thousand negative reviews have been saying about this movie. You know, I'm a very optimistic guy. If one of my professors told me I only had a ten percent chance of passing the class, I would stick in there and hope for the best. As for Dr. Boll, I had the same optimism and for his other turkey, House of the Dead. Now this is no HotD review, but the movie was awful, and perhaps it was not his fault. Something could of gone wrong during filming, and maybe--just maybe--Dr. Boll isn't that bad. So I had some hopes for Alone in the Dark, but I now know since I have seen his latest film, I am positve: Dr. Uwe Boll cannot make a good movie if his life depended on it, and with the way his career is going now, I won't be surprised if something happens to him. Especially with all this anti-Boll messages popping all over the web.\n\n1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He's done the unthinkable. He may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on IMDb! He's like some kind of cinematic cockroach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these movies are, he manages to keep making them. I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the latest one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of game play. There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnby's adventures, but this is not it. Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he's not stopped. Someone needs to take away his line of credit, or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title any more.\n\nThink about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore? No way. A new House of the Dead game comes out for X-Box and nobody's gonna care. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher... please warn them.\n\nThis movie itself is not even worth reviewing. I can't separate what I didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it. Literally, everything about it sucks. The writing, the acting, the music, the CG effects, the editing. I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented it with low expectations, I wouldn't be disappointed. Boy, was I wrong. Never underestimate Uwe's ability to turn out a big, steaming pile of BOLL sh*t."

Lo and Tom Hanks emo-fest, unable to write anything even remotely qualified about horror, fantasy, or monster movies. Throw some action into the mix and disaster beckons.\n\nThe movie was a nice blend of comic book styling, action/suspense, and big CGI monsters. If you like the Aviator, stay away from the movie (and by reciprocity, writing reviews of said movie). If you are looking for a simple, fun, action/monster movie based on a video game few remember, then go see it if there is nothing better you have been anticipating. The movie isn't great, but it isn't bad either. It is simply a decent, fun movie, for those whose expectations aren't misguided. The beginning was a little slow, the volume too loud at times, and the ending was great. The movie is Alone in the Dark, not Fried Green Tomatoes. Again, chicks and guys who dye their hair (Maxim readers anyone?)should avoid.\n\nI can hardly wait to see the people who gave this movie low marks make a stab at reviewing the next Judas Priest or Slipknot CD."

What was Infogrames thinking when they sold the license to this jerk?\n\nWhere did all the Lovecraftian horrors end up? Where are the subtle mystery and intrigue?

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember reading all the horrible, horrible reviews for this film when it came out. I meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks. The only other movie to manage that is Gigli.\n\nWhen the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was. I couldn't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible. After seeing it, I can understand.\n\nFirst off, let me say that this film is not without some cool shots. There's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun, which I thought was neat. And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it.\n\nLet me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad acting was a sin, then Hell would've chucked Tara Reid right out since she's so unbelievably awful in this movie it's unthinkable. And of all the roles, she plays a curator. Now if she played a dumb, empty- headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll didn't realize that, although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie, people would see it. He just didn't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad. And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping? I couldn't tell.\n\nWhich brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I'd give House of the Dead an F (and I only do that for very few movies) but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk. The movie starts off with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion (and read by a horrible narrator) and from there, the cuts are really, really dumb. There's this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that's been destroyed and the screen blackens out. When it comes back, Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly, an entire army has joined them. Huh?\n\nAnd someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie. At one point, a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reid's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead comrade, you can see her begin to get up.\n\nAs for the story... I was really lost. Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone \"opens the path\" or something and all the evil monsters pop out. It's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film) that get, quite simply, BORING.\n\nI bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I didn't laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, most of you will probably look at me like I'm insane for rating this film, that the majority have deemed abysmal, a 10. But for myself, I think the quality of films are mostly based on biased opinions (including mine) and that we let our own personal views affect what we think and what we are to expect.\n\nFirst off, not every movie can be an art house/indie/thought provoker such as Sideways or Lost in Translation. This film tries to be what it is, entertaining and stylish and that it certainly is. I'll start off by reviewing the camera work/style: It is outstanding and the cinematography is gorgeous. The film couldn't look much better if it tried. The atmosphere and lighting used makes for an outstanding surrounding that looks impressive on the camera and also makes for a very believable environment. Uwe certainly knows how to use the camera, that can't really be denied.\n\nPlot is another issue. For those of you who were irritated by the crawl text at the beginning must have lost your memories, because the movies you know and love as the Star Wars films have an even slower and longer crawl text at their beginnings but they all seem to be overlooked. Just a point...but as for the actual plot of the film, it is rather good. It doesn't tell a story already told by the video games, but rather includes ANOTHER adventure of Edward Carnby, thus furthering his story and letting also have some background on his character. The story revolves around an ancient Indian race called Abkani, who vanished mysteriously after opening a portal to the world of darkness. In the future, a government agency called 713 would further investigate this, created nocturnal creatures called Xenos, that destroy on command. Humans are then experimented on and attempted to be merged with the creatures, only half of this is successful. Years later, Carnby is tracked down and hunted because he has a piece of the key that opens the portal to darkness. He fights the creatures commanded to kill him, reunites with an old flame and old rival, and tries to find out the mystery behind his own past and connection with the demonic forces after him. Won't spoil the rest, but the film is there and so is the plot...I simply don't understand how one could miss it? Acting is decent, could've been better on all fronts. Christian Slater was good and alongside Stephen Dorff carried the film on their backs and put performances that were worthy of recognition. Will Sanderson was good as the evil scientist and played his role very well. Tara Reid is my only complaint, she was horribly miscast and the fact that she couldn't act made matters worse, but she wasn't there to act, rather to be eye candy...and she did that very well. She resembles a high school drama student and a sub par one at that...stick to Van Wilder.\n\nThe action here is intense and amazing as well, there is one particular scene in Carnby's apartment where the creatures come and a \"blackout shootout\" occurs and indeed it is a cinematic beauty. The action and suspense are high and the excellent atmosphere, good acting, and interesting plot all bring this together in what I thought was a very under promoted, and under-appreciated film. To say Ed Wood made better is ludicrous and to say that this is the worst film ever made is also ignorant because if you look outside the box and try to think of this as entertainment rather than Oscar material, then you'll enjoy more."

However, while this movie isn't the next Reservoir Dogs or The Matrix, it's an enjoyable little action/horror flick with an intriguing story.\n\nFirst of all, technically, this movie is quite well done. The computer effects aren't exceptional, but they're better than those in many recent Hollywood flicks. The creature design is pretty cool, too, even though some close-ups of the monsters are visibly computer generated.\n\nActing is generally sub-par, but not annoyingly so. I like Dorff and Slater, and they deliver their part. Some of the supporting cast is pretty bad, but they aren't on screen for too long.\n\nThe main weakness of the movie is the script. There are some plot holes, and the story is a bit complicated. But if you pay attention, read the intro and listen to the voice-overs, it's quite easy to follow what's happening. Large parts of the story seem to be taken from Lincoln/Child novels, which is just fine with me since I think more of their books should be turned into movies.\n\nThe film is about 50% horror and 50% action. While it couldn't stand as an action movie or as a horror flick, the combination of the two make it quite interesting. The action scenes are well filmed, with great music scores and some interesting camera perspectives. The horror scenes deliver the scares, and caught me off-guard four or five times.\n\nAll in all, this isn't a memorable movie, but it *is* a very enjoyable movie, clearly better than some of the recent Hollywood action/horror movies like Species 3 or Cat Woman. It absolutely does not deserve the low rating it currently has. If you like action/horror movies, rent this. Don't expect a movie in the level of Underworld or Blade, and you won't be disappointed."

Well, it seems as though one can, and that one is the man himself, Uwe Boll. Alone in the Dark is just bad, plain and simple, there is nothing good about it at all. It is basically a mish-mash of crap. Acting? Wooden. Script? A mess. Music? Unbearable. Characters? Random. Directing? ..........\n\nRight from the start I knew it was heading up **** creek without a paddle when (Texas Chain Saw Massacre style), text started scrolling up the screen while a narrator reads it out in a deadpan voice. What I found strange was the text basically gave away the twist, and for the rest of the movie it was about the main character Edward Carnby (Christian Slater, who obviously needed a paycheck) trying to unravel the mystery of which we already know the details of. Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff also pop by to pick up a paycheck and add no life to their cardboard characters. However, my beef is not with the actors, but with the stupid story and direction. The main problem with the story was I understood very little of it, it just made no sense. Random pieces of story were thrown in here and there with no explanation (what the hell was the old professor doing in the forest commanding all the creatures?) and the scenes all looked cut and pasted into the movie. One minute the two main characters are making love (where and why I couldn't quite work out) and the next they are shooting aliens with twenty SWAT guys in the same building. And of course, this fight was accompanied by random camera movement, strobe lighting and heavy metal music.\n\nI am going to stop now, because I could write an essay about the stupidity of Alone in the Dark and Uwe Boll. Basically, avoid this movie like the plague it is, go watch ANYTHING else, but just ignore this load of trash.\n\n\u00bd/5"

        "review_title": "Alone in the Dark final proof video game movies don't work",
        "review_detailed_main": "There should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible. RE was a survival horror game, and a damn effective one at that, yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil, so of course, there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie. Instead, Alone in the Dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies.\n\nThe plot, despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter, is the largest of many problems with the movie. The movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important, as after a minute passes, the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them. Then there's something about an orphanage, some artefacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on. Characters move in and out of the plot like candy, some having huge build-ups for meaningless deaths. Basically, what I can understand is that some demons got released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him. He finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex-girlfriend anthropologist (Reid), who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks loose, and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander (Dorff), who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby.\n\nIt's all ridiculous, and the reason I don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled, but it leaves no room for anyone to really care. Instead, I highly recommend that, if you must see this film, bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion.\n\nThe action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made, with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens. Considering that this is based on a horror game, not an action game, it is especially annoying.\n\nThe first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness, and the rest isn't all that great either. The demons look somewhat cool, though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect. Scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict. It's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night.\n\nThe acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing. Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie, though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on. The same is true of Dorff, who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent (something that has happened to him a lot). Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be, background sex appeal, as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster (as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning).\n\nIn all, this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies. If they keep ruining the spirit like this, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing Middle-Easterns with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this one doesn't deserve a second chance, as I don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is. It's bland, uninteresting and unexciting. This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea; it's all thrown together, nothing really fits and, in the end, you're just glad it's over.\n\nTOTAL: 4%"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Alone in the Dark\" reviewed by The Correct Critic\n\n\"Alone in the Dark\" is an appropriate title for the first film I ever saw alone in a dark theatre. It's a good thing I saw this disaster alone, because if I had asked a friend along, I would have been dreadfully embarrassed. Most of the January-February movie fare is as tempting as my mother's cream cheese and jelly sandwiches. With the Oscar buzz high, studios feel the hype over the Best Picture nominations will drown out any talk of these duds. Hollywood may even make a few million dollars off these disgraces without drawing criticism that 90% of movies released in January or February are not worth two dollars, let alone nine or ten. That said, \"Alone in the Dark\" barely qualifies as one of these duds, because it is hardly a movie. The plot, if you insist. Well, there is no plot, but rather an incomprehensible premise based on an Atari video game. Christian Slater plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal investigator. An insult to the Warrens, Carnby is trying to solve a mystery. During Carnby's youth, he and eighteen other orphans were abducted from a home for a brief time. Carnby possesses little recollection of that fateful night. Tara Reid plays Carnby's girlfriend/ex-girlfriend, a museum archaeologist specializing in Abskani artifacts. Tara Reid as a scientists \u0096 yeah, that's believable. Attempting to show she is no longer the All-American Pie girl, Reid adds a rough edge to her voice, only to sound like she suffers from emphysema. Her acting suggests she is smoking something, and I am not talking about nicotine addiction. Thrown into the mix is a mad scientist, a team of paranormal investigators under the title 713, zombies, and half-invisible creatures. The filmmakers feel these elements tie together; the audience may not share their perspective. The director, Uwe Boll, is on the same level as Ed Wood, a man voted Worst Director of All-Time by a critical survey. But while Ed Wood and his monster movies were laughable (come on, the man was a transvestite), there is nothing funny about Uwe Boll. I was astounded to discover that this man, who has his characters spout the clich\u00e9 lines \"It's happening again\" and \"Some door were never meant to be opened,\" actually has a Ph.D. in literature. \"Alone in the Dark\" is one of the two worst movies I have seen in my life. The other is a film adaptation of Antigone our English class viewed last year. That horror consisted of five spoken words, a nails-on-the-chalkboard score, and a bunch of females licking each other. You can always identify the worst movies, because they are literally painful to sit through. The obnoxious, ear-splitting noises (meant to scare) and the flashing of machine gun fire in \"Alone in the Dark\" gave me a headache. They should have cut the movie down to 30 seconds, and aired it during the Super Bowl as a live action Halo 2 commercial. Does \"Alone in the Dark\" have any redeeming qualities? Aside from instilling aspiring filmmakers with hope and confidence, NO. If I had the time, I would definitely stand outside my local cinema and picket this garbage. This is the movies at their absolute worst - the \"Citizen Kane\" of poor film-making folks. A sin against the art, \"Alone in the Dark\" will be damned to the ninth circle of Dante's inferno, where it will spend eternity frozen in black solitude."

With an archaeologist helping him to trace his findings back through time for centuries, the mystery only gets more complicated the further they delve into it.\n\nSo this is my very first Uwe Boll film and you know what? It isn't as bad as any of the other mediocre films out there. Maybe people just wanted to join the bandwagon? Well, getting that controversy out of the way, I found this film mediocre. The directing style looked incredibly amateur, which is surprising.\n\nAs for the story, I had no idea what was going on yet I was slightly entertained. It was much less boring than \"The Return\". The movie actually has some good special effects for the creatures and their design looked great. Although there are some clich\u00e9s, this film managed to put TWO (yes, you read TWO) clich\u00e9s to rest! Now the most recent movie that did that was \"P2\" and this was another one.\n\nTo find the two, I guess you'll have to watch the movie. Other than that, the performances were mediocre. Anything else to point out? Was this the worst movie ever? NO. Should you watch this movie to make sure? I don't know and I don't care. I just mildly enjoyed it with its cheesiness and fun."

This is my first review, so I might not be perfect at it, so forgive me if this review isn't good.\n\nAlone in the Dark is one of my favorite movies. I'm a big Christian Slater fan, and this is my favorite one of his movies. I will never understand why this movie is considered one of the worst of all time.\n\nI've never played any of the Alone in the Dark games, so I wasn't really expecting anything when I saw this movie. When I did watch it, I had a great time, and loved it so much that I got it on dvd for Christmas.\n\nOne thing that a lot of people complain about is the acting in the movie, but I thought that all of the acting (aside from Tara Reid's) was passable. Maybe I've just seen acting so much worse that my bad acting detector stopped working properly.\n\nThe action sequences in the movie might not be the best of all time, but they're still fun to watch. I understand that the video games are not action packed, but like I said, I've never played the games, so I don't really mind. The action in this movie isn't bad in my opinion, and is very entertaining.\n\nThe monsters, while they are Xenomorph rip-offs, are pretty awesome. They look really cool, and are pretty menacing. They aren't as cool as Xenomorphs, but they're still pretty cool.\n\nMy only complaint about this movie is Tara Reid's performance. It isn't the worst that I've seen, but it wasn't the best either. It doesn't ruin the movie for me, but it is the only thing that I don't like about the movie.\n\nAlone in the Dark is a movie that I think everyone should watch at least once. Don't go in with high expectations, and you'll have a good time. I give Alone in the Dark a perfect 10/10."

So stop complaining about this movie, though it's \"bad\" :p. It's absolutely watchable and it has some scenes that maybe will make you jump up your sofa. Even I got scared in some scenes, and that doesn't happen to much I can tell you. Give the movie a chance, and watch it with a girl, she will definitely hold your hand and stay the night ;).

Turns out somebody was carrying the script and dropped it, the wind took away several pages, and the ones recovered were mixed and matched in the wrong places. My other theory is that they all showed up at the set without a script, decided to shoot some random scenes of cool looking paramilitary guys shooting CGI monsters and leave it to some guy in the editing room to make sense of it. Maybe some scrolling text at the beginning would say something about a plot and that would do it. The deal is, the producers had Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff at the hotel, the paramilitary costumes were ready, there was a little sun in Vancouver, the heavy metal soundtrack was ready and the CGI guys were already animating the monsters, so why waste time waiting for the writer to do a plot."

But I also believe a lot of people just go with the hype and give it a low rating because they hear everyone else hates it.\n\nThe film, as far as I understand, has nothing to do with the games whatsoever. Which may be why a lot of people hate it. I never played the games, so I wouldn't know. But as for the plot, people do exaggerate how confusing it is. Heck, I've never played any Alone in the Dark games, I watched the movie on my computer while chatting with my friends and I wasn't that confused. So it can't be that bad. Granted there are a few things that are never explained, and leave you feeling dissatisfied at the end.\n\nThe \"villain\". Old professor who injects himself with demon blood and wants to unleash a bunch of demons to take over the world. OK, for this type of film that's perfectly acceptable. But we never ever get to know why he wants to do this, what made him turn evil or why he's even necessary to the plot. In fact, his presence is actually just needed at the very, very end for one very brief sequence. So he's a totally useless villain that can't help but to confuse the audience.\n\nThen there's some jumping in time and very unlikely happenings. For example, in one scene Christian Slater and Tara Reid is attacked by zombies in his house. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Stephen Dorff and his gang shows up. Alright, I can buy that. But why does he bring Slater and Reid along to the old abandoned goldmine? And couldn't they at least explained to the audience a little better that they were going to look for the old portal mentioned at the beginning? Also, why the heck does Tara Reid, who works at a museum, follow Slater, Dorff and a team of elite agents down into alien infected territory? The script isn't smart. Nor is the dialog. But the acting is alright. It's very uneven, with Slater and Dorff giving good performances, a bunch of other guys giving mediocre and a good chunk of the cast giving awful, but at least Slater and Dorff manages. Likewise, the music is very uneven. When it tries to be suspenseful, it suffers. But in action scenes, it's good.\n\nSpeaking of the action scenes, they are fairly nice. Very well shot and visually impressive. To bad there's to little variation. It's basically just a bunch of agents shooting aliens with their automatic rifles over and over again. Gets tiresome after awhile, despite the music and the nice visuals.\n\nI wouldn't mind it if Uwe Boll made a straight out action film sometime. In fact, it might turn out quite good. But suspense and plot are not his strong points.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty dull movie. It's not really that bad. Just dull. That's it's main problem."

I liked the bit at the beginning with the rolling words, that kind of thing might've gotten a person slightly nervous. I just couldn't stop thinking of the old man, Fischer I believe his name was, that just rolled on into port with a bunch of dead bodies and blood strewn over the walls. How did that process go? Just so everyone knows, I didn't finish this. Turned it off when the surgeon guy (well the one that scanned Carnby with... something) was standing in his kitchen with his wife.

I wanted to turn it off. I wanted to go to sleep. But I kept watching for the sake of the review I am writing now.\n\nNothing was good about this movie. The story was forgettable (I seriously don't remember it), the acting was high school talent show-ish, and the script was a mistake. It had to have been a mistake. I can't find another way to explain how a script as bad as the one used for Alone in the Dark could have been written. And the action...

It'll look cool.\" Not an exact quote, but I bet it comes close.\n\nAlone in the Dark isn't \"so bad its good.\" Its just so bad.

And even with the backstory literally typed out on the screen during the intro, much of the film still doesn't make any sense.\n\nDon't even bother watching this beast."

The clue is in the Title: ALONE in the DARK. The fevered anticipation the game arose in you is kin to Dallas crawling through the Nostromo air ducts, not some sub-par Starship Troopers style shootouts on a building site.\n\nAt no point did I care about the characters, they could all be wiped out and it would be of more interest to watch the CGI creatures go about their daily lives. The plot is non-existent, as if each actor is playing a role in a different film, turned up on the wrong set and went through their lines, not a shred of story is told.\n\nIn all this isn't a bad film, as we know, bad films can be quite entertaining, this is just a hollow pointless waste of 90 minutes or so. Some OK camera work saves it from a 1.\n\nIn addition - worst thing about this movie is that it probably killed the gaming franchise, and that's where the true horror of this movie lies."

This movie reminded me of a bad made-for-cable movie. And if it had been on TV, I would have changed the channel after the first 10 minutes. In fact, was this movie a direct-to-video release? THis was definitely Tara Reid's worst performance since 'Around the Fire.' After seeing this, it is hard to refer to her as an 'actor.' She would have a hard time getting cast for community Theodore. And why did Slater agree to this flick? I found out that this movie was based on a video game. Like Silent Hill, this movie suffers from many of the same problems that plaque game-to-movie titles. First, the plot is choppy and leaves the viewer filling in logical holes. The acting is also choppy and has that cold, impersonal feeling you'd get if it was created by computers themselves. Further, the plot is unoriginal and boring. By the time the climax scene comes, you've long since given up on caring about the characters or the outcome. In fact, I found myself hoping that they would all perish. FUrther, the sets look cheap and 'empty'. It was as if the movie was shot over the course of a weekend. All in all, this is an embarrassment for all involved. Save your time and avoid this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Edward Carnby, detective of the paranormal, unexplained and supernatural, investigates a mystery (the recent death of a friend) with clues leading to \"Shadow Island\" that brings him face to face with bizarre horrors that prove both psychologically disturbing and lethal, as he discovers that evil demons worshiped by an ancient culture called the Abskani are planning on coming back to life in the 21st century to once again take over the world... and only he and a young genius anthropologist with an incredible memory (and his ex-girlfriend), Aline Cedrac, stand in their way, at a gateway to hell. Standing in Carnby's way, however, is the impact that a brief encounter with an evil spirit called the Queen had upon his mind, as he slowly finds himself overpowered by the forces of darkness as they eat away at his very sanity...\n\nUwe Boll became known to the world with the video game horror based film House of the Dead. After the horrible reviews and box office, someone somewhere decided to let Uwe Boll destroy another video game franchise, this time it's another horror video game, Alone in the Dark. Which frankly is how you should watch the movie, if you have to that is.\n\nAlone in the Dark goes wrong in so many directions, the first would have to be the screenplay, which has too many plot holes and confusing storyline that no one can tell what is going on. Throw into the mix a director that has no clue what he is doing except throwing an explosion here and a shootout there. Boll did one thing right, make the movie about soldiers shooting creatures, instead of your everyday party goers, such as seen in House.\n\nAlone in the Dark suffers from a lot of different things, but even if you didn't know who Uwe Boll is or how bad the script actually is, you must be able to notices the horrible casting job. Who in their right mind would think of Tara Reid for a genius anthropologist? Her lines range from horribly delivered, to \"hey look over here\" or \"hey check this out\". Slater plays an Indiana Jones type character, who lacks the charm, wit, courage, intelligence...basically everything that makes Indiana Jones.\n\nStephen Dorff isn't that bad of an actor, he just has the unfortunate curse of choosing bad movie roles. Either he needs a new agent, or needs to get better material thrown his way. Frankly military leader hunting the beast who has conflict with the lead character doesn't do him justice.\n\nA lot of the scenes are laughable when Boll tries to make them hip for the new generation. Such as the characters being in total darkness, then shooting the bullets that have lights on them which light up the characters and the screen. Boll should take some directing lessons and not try to make something look appealing.\n\nIt's obvious that Boll doesn't care about the story, or just doesn't understand it, the characters, the music, basically everything that makes a movie with the exception of special effects. Boll tries to make the film cool with it's \"slo-mo\" and of course the shot where the monster jumps at the screen.\n\nApparently someone out there thinks Boll is doing something right because he has numerous video game titles on the way, next up is Bloodrayne. I can only hope that when FarCry hits the theatres he will learn from his mistakes and make at least a decent film for once in his life."

Always a bad sign as the producers appear to assume that the average punter is too stupid to read! Having watched this from start to finish, I can understand why! Little plot, no character development, a bit of macho posturing, and absolutely no suspense as you see what they are \"Alone in the Dark\" with almost straight away - a badly computer animated half crab/alien that looks like it fell straight out of someone's X-Box. Which it no doubt did! Avoid at all costs - you'll only feel annoyed with yourself that you wasted nearly 2 hours of your life on such rubbish when you could have used it better on something else - like going into a coma!"

I need another fix, is what I am saying, and I don't really care how I get it - if we had to sell the urn that Grandma's ashes were in or pawn my daughter's wheelchair, I will get the money to get me a fix! So when I finished the latest Alone in the Dark game, I cried a little, then wet my pants (I have a problem, its really not funny) from the emotional trauma, and I said, \"Please, Lord, what must I do, besides going for 4 years of Computer Science, 3 years becoming a junior programmer in small gaming firm - JUST to get another Alone in the Dark video game?\" Well my prayers were answered - almost- with this movie. I showed up with my joystick, but there were no joystick ports in the theater where I was sitting. So I was denied the user interface that some of the other film patrons must have had. Other than that, I would say that who ever was playing the game did pretty good and solved the mystery in record time I might add! I kept yelling \"dude, when's my turn?\", but like most of my friends, the cretins in the theater told me to shut up. So to sum up: this film would be a 10 if I could have got my chance to play for a while and the acting was superb for computer generated characters - almost as good as Grand Theft Auto!! I would recommend this movie to any hardcore gamer like myself. Oh and I loved the talking dragon!"

After forcing Artisan out of business over the flop that was House of the Dead, one can only assume the normally credible Lion's Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisan's assets. Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film-making ability, plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie's framework.\n\nBut then that's the point, isn't it. Boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct Alone in the Dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood.\n\nAlone in the Dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are \"announced\" or in \"pre-production\".\n\nThese aren't movies to be directed, but investment portfolios. Every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects he can release within that time-frame, the more money he and his investors can gain. Why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a mint anyway? The result is movies like the awfulness of Alone in the Dark.\n\nAlone in the Dark, like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current trend for lazy film-making.\n\nAnd to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, by making a cult figure out of the man, you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety.\n\nFor more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=21699 As an aside, just don't ask me how he's getting his cast-lists together. Unless the actors are in on the investment-scam somehow, that mystery has still to be uncovered."

This is simply a movie that does everything wrong. I haven't played the video game that this movie is based off of, so I can't say if it's a good adaptation, but the film is just so bad, that even if it was, it wouldn't help.\n\nThe writing is terrible, there are plot holes everywhere, it rips off a bunch of other movies, the characters are bland and forgettable, the dialog is bad, and it feels clustered. The acting isn't much better, I can't blame these actors, they didn't have much to work with. It almost seems like they know how bad the movie is.\n\nAnd the direction is horrible. At points, I can't even tell what's going on, the editing is so annoying at times. The ending doesn't make any sense at all, and there are continuity errors everywhere. There is literally a scene where it was pitch black outside, and the five minutes later it's sunny, and I don't mean the sun is just rising, I mean it looks like ten in the morning.\n\nThe CGI is ranges from average to bad, and the worst part of the film, it's just really boring. I thought that at the very least the film would be so bad it's good, and there are a few chuckles to be had, but for the most part it's just a snore fest.\n\nAlone in the Dark is the worst film I have seen thus far. It didn't tick me off as much as some other films, but it really is a terrible inconsistent film."

Cheesy CGI, bad plot, insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack.\n\nAlone In The Dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody. Woo hoo! Review over.

Plus what does everyone expect from this type of movie anyways.\n\nSo if you have played the game then maybe you need to forget about the game. If you have never played the game then just don't expect it to be the greatest movie out there. Its a horror movie people. History has shown us most of these types of movies are never really that great to begin with. The acting is never the greatest. The scary factor is never that scary. How many movies has everyone actually watched that was really scary. Maybe i can think of 5 out of the thousands of movies i have seen in my lifetime.\n\nNow lets address the issue everyone has about it having no plot. Maybe you need to go back and watch it again and pay attention to the absolute beginning where they do give you a little bit of history on whats going on. Granted they could give you more on what is what but most movies don't give you all the information you would really like to have. There was somewhat of a plot as far as I was concerned.\n\nThis movie may not be the highest rated movie out there but i believe it deserves a better rating then what it has gotten so for. A 2.0 is really not true. I have seen a lot of movies 10 times worse then this one was. I would at least give it about a 5.6 out of 10\n\nI'll give this movie one of the biggest credits that most movies i can not give. At least i wasn't bored and wanted to go to sleep. I sat through the whole thing wanting to see what was gonna happen next. Not many movies out there can at least do that.\n\nOverall i would say its at least worth seeing in the movie theatres so you can enjoy it. If you don't want to pay full price for it go to a matin\u00e9e where the prices are cheaper. It is worth the watch. You will at least be entertained and not completed bored to sleep."

This film was worst than most B films from the 1970's. Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are learned actors and can be directed, if given a script and director thats worth the time and effort. Who was the girl?? I don't think she was necessary. What was the premise?? A game?? What if you have never played the game?? It took me 5 hours to watch this film...I kept turning it off. If I had seen it in a theater I would had walked out. I feel sorry for the investors for this film. I feel even sorrier for the actors, they have to put it on their resume. I presume this film took one week to film. Where do these directors get the money to produce such garbage?? I would like to meet those investors so I can give them a true return on their money. I advise the director and writers of this film get a job at a dollar store or work for the city utilities or something of that nature...thats job security at least. In future I will be highly skeptical of seeing a Lions Gate film. I will never see a film made by this director again...NEVER. I will be weary of the screen writer as well. Stephen, Christian...not to worry...just kick your agent for me and be a bit more picky.\n\nFinal opinion of \"Alone in the Dark\" I used the tape to record two hours of the Teletubbies...."

Anyone who has done this will know what I mean. The only thing funnier than how horrible this movie actually is, is how amazing Uwe Boll thinks it is. Pay close attention to the sex scene, the commentary on that scene is comic gold. It's like the man lives in his own little world, in which there are no greater directors than himself. He truly lives up to his Ed Wood comparison. However, I would suggest watching this in the company of friends, to share the humor with. I imagine it can be found in the 99 cent bin at any local video store. A few drinks probably wouldn't hurt either (You are, after all, still watching Alone In The Dark)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh, Uwe Boll. Not only were you terrible with comedy, you don't seem to understand the basics of horror/action filmmaking either. Or dialogue. Or human interactions.\n\nAlone in the Dark starts with an impossibly long text crawl that explains, in confusing detail, the world that the movie takes place in. The thing is, what's actually there isn't that far removed from what other movie that combine paranormal investigative teams, ancient cults, and otherworldly dangers. I was reminded of Hellboy, and while Hellboy isn't Guillermo del Toro's greatest work, it does cleanly establish the rules of its alternate version of reality that involves Rasputin, the Old Gods, a demon baby, a secret government organization, and a few Nazis trying to bring about the end of the world. Alone in the Dark tells a similar story but it's told in such a convoluted way that it's really hard to simply figure out what is going on.\n\nThere are flashbacks to the main character's childhood that seem to end with implications of a bunch of dead kids, but they're all alive twenty years later and have been turned into some kind of unkillable monster zombies. There's talk of a secret division of the government out for paranormal research and defense, but its history is really unclear until the very end when some of it gets cleared up (way too late to matter). The basic professional relationship between the professor who disappears and reappears at will and the secret division is muddled at best. This movie didn't have to be a great work of art to just arrange the information of how everything works together across, but it also wouldn't have taken that much effort. Maybe Boll was trying to be unpredictable, but he ended up just being confusing. Or, he's just an awful storyteller who has no idea what he's doing. There's always that.\n\nTo make the movie experience even worse, it's not populated with characters but human looking automatons that spout expository gibberish at each other. No one seems to have a discernable motivation to do anything. They do it because it is their type and they are in an action horror movie, so those types must be followed. Dialogue is stilted and unnatural and most of the actors are really just sleepwalking through the whole thing. The only exception is Stephen Dorff. Poor Stephen Dorff...he was almost Aragorn, you know. He gives his all in this \"film\" as the badass and hardnosed leader of a squad of secret government paranormal troopers. He throws tables and emotes, dammit, he emotes, but the character is threadbare and no one else around him cares.\n\nThe movie is also largely flatly lit. Everything set inside during the day looks like it was filmed for a cheap television show. There are no shadows and everything seems so two-dimensional. When the CG monsters attack, the lights go out and we get a bunch of darkness that's equally flat. The absolute low point of the film is probably the moment when there's a desperate attack on our \"heroes\" in the dark with guns blazing, and the music cranks up some kind of pulse pounding hard rock. It's so completely antithetical to the idea of how to build a sequence in an action/horror film that I laughed.\n\nThis film is shoddily made, confusingly assembled, boringly performed (save poor Stephen Dorff), and doesn't understand the basic building blocks of a horror sequence. Oh, Uwe Boll, my life would have been better had I not decided to try your \"movies\" out."

The story is good and there are some scary parts, it's not going to win anyone any Oscars but it's heads and tails above House of the Dead. Again, you may not like Boll's style of directing or editing, but it's a decent movie. This probably should have been released in the summer as a teen horror type movie, but it should do fairly well being released now. Again, go see it just for Christian Slater. I hope he gets more and better roles from here on out."

Personally i like it.\n\nI don't say it was an extraordinary movie, but it was a cool moment, the story was not the big point, i found it a little weird but there good action scene, very good special effect, lot of gun fighting sequence, lot of action, and some Gore scene that look very cool. Yes its military a lot, it does not look like the game from what i saw of it, but if you put in mind first that you are going to see a cool action-horror movie you can have a great moment. I don't see much why people call it \"Worst movie ever\" or the acting is bad or whatever, Tara Reid is not a bad actress, i like every movie i saw her in, and yes in this movie we see more Christian Slater but for what we see of her, she is good. As for Slater, there some cool fighting at the beginning and he play well."

This film, with such a peculiar name, probably caught your eye.\n\nI imagine that this film is loosely based on the game \"Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare.\" However, perhaps the only things this film has in common with the games are its title and the characters' names.\n\nI played a lot of games, although I haven't played any more lately. I've always been a big fan of horror games, but I know little about the Alone in the Dark game series. So, I watched the film as an ordinary viewer, just watching the story without comparing it to the game itself.\n\nThe plot is generic. Through certain artifacts, a historian dominated by darkness can cast a supposed supreme evil on the earth. Edward Carnby is a supernatural detective who can save humanity.\n\nThe concept of having a government agency that investigates paranormal events did not go very well with me. When the Government is involved, the idea of ??terror in the dark loses its charm.\n\nThe film itself has a good pace, despite being generic. It even looks like a movie from a triple-A company. CGI is a little out of date, but I understand that the film was released in the first decade of 2000.\n\nI can't finish without mentioning Carnby's costume. The main characters need to stand out from the crowd, but the overcoat just makes him goofy. Video games are video games, but in real life, that overcoat is pretty old-fashioned.\n\nRecommended? I would not recommend this film for casual viewers. This film is definitely a film for fans of horror films in general, regardless of quality."

        "review_detailed_main": "As expected by another direction job by Uwe Boll, this movie is once again terrible. Boll really seems to have a talent for creating horrid films, and this is one that again does not disappoint.\n\nWhile it is slightly better than House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark really does not have any redeeming factors whatsoever. There is a lengthy opening title sequence which, unlike something like Star Wars, is even narrated. I mean, does Uwe Boll seriously believe his viewers to be analphabetic? Does he think nobody that views his films can read? If the viewer's intelligence equals the intelligence of his films, perhaps that would be the case. It features characters that do not have any character development, no definining traits and no personality. Somehow Boll also manages to get an horrendous performance from every actor in his film. I get that most of the actors in his film are usually terrible, but Christian Slater, who is by no means a bad actor, is just absolute garbage in this movie. Boll has also done this to other critically acclaimed actors such as Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley, Burt Reynolds & Ron Perlman. These are great actors, but somehow in films with Uwe Boll they are all just absolutely horrible, and seem to not have any motivation to be there. The same is true with Christian Slater in this one, as he wanders through the entire ordeal as if it is a struggle for him as an actor.\n\nThe acting as hinted to in my previous rant was once again terrible. Tara Reid is the most obvious example of this. This is an absolutely terrible actress further made ridiculous by the terrible writing this film has. She is this stereotypical sexy secretary who is, ofcourse, blonde. Let's not forget that she is also wearing glasses so that the stereotype becomes full circle. Apparently Slater's character is her boyfriend, although we never get to see why this is the case because both characters are soulless, cartoonish, monotonous 'people' that do not resemble any actual human beings whatsoever. The screenplay is as usual in a Uwe Boll production once again garbage. The most evident example of this is during the ridiculous conversation between a kid and Slater in the airplane. The kid states his mom says there is nothing to be afraid of in the dark, to which Slater answers: 'Your mother's wrong kid, being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive', like it is common knowledge in this world that Abkani gateways open between darkness and light.\n\nIt also features narrative exposition. But do not expect something along the likes of The Shawshank Redemption or Goodfellas in this. The narration is absolutely atrocious. Literally everything that Slater narrates in this film consists of obvious facts that have been shown to us in great detail one scene or a couple of scenes earlier before. It is an insulting display of exposition, and it further makes me realize that Uwe Boll does indeed think that only idiots watch his films, because it is in the end ofcourse also an idiotic film itself.\n\nAction sequences feature horrible editing and a lot of shakycam shots. There is never a clear overview of anything in any action sequence, but there is one scene in particular one has to point out. There is a scene when the Xeno's ( Yeah... this name is not an Alien ripoff by the way... definitely not. ) invade Slater's home and out of nowhere these paranormal investigators ( Who seem more like the SWAT instead of what they are supposed to be ) show up. What follows is a sequence that features an extreme amount of cuts, hilariously unfitting heavy metal music & an obvious lack of vision due to there being no lighting, Which brings me to my next point, the lighting of this film. This is a film with horrible lighting and terrible production values in general. There are so many shots in which the only thing visible is pure darkness. The one scene i just mentioned is the worst example of this, but there is literally nothing to see in this entire film. Everything is just complete and utter darkness. This cinematographer is on par with Uwe Boll's qualities. The CGI & visual effects look like cheap 1990 videogame garbage. Especially the one scene where a gate opens and loads of the Xeno's are visible. It just looks so bloated and ugly.\n\nWhile there is much more to argue about substantially in Alone in the Dark, the bottom line i tried to summarize is that is has terrible acting, writing, lighting, CGI, special effects, narration & characters. The only positive thing i can say about it is that it is better than Uwe Boll's House of the Dead, but that's not saying much. It is still definitely one of the worst films ever made."

Anyways from what I gather from looking at the plot(if there was one), some experiments were experimented on some children with some psychic abilities on a local house until one of them escaped resulting to the rest of them to escape as well. Several years later and adults with them coming telekinetic linking them together to form a bond to seek answers of their existence with a squadron to assist them. The movie stars and is lead by actors Christian Slater as Edward and Tara Reid as Aline with Stephen Dorf as Cmdr. Richard Burke.

I feel like each of the three writers started on their own scripts, ran out of time, and pasted their work together with no regard for continuity, logic, or entertainment value. They tried to cover up their mistakes by presenting these inconsistencies as ZOMG BRILLYINT PLOT TWISTZ!!! but the movie mostly just doesn't make any sense. AT ALL.\n\nThe acting is just sad. I really didn't care about any of the characters, and I think it's obvious that the actors didn't either. (Pay attention to the security guard at the museum; he is very obviously a shortcut to explain things that should be revealed through a decently written plot.)\n\nThe camera work is ridiculous. The camera is there to show the action, not to show off the technique you're in love with today. And the music... OHHHHH GOD, THE MUSIC. A movie score is supposed to subtly enhance the action on the screen, but since no one seemed to be telling anyone else what was going on during this fiasco, they decided to slam bad metal music into your ears as yet another distraction technique.\n\nMy friends and I make a habit of watching bad movies and razzing them mercilessly. Alone in the Dark was so bad that we couldn't even make fun of it. While drunk. That is AMAZING."

        "review_detailed_main": "ALONE IN THE DARK is sheer genius, an absolutely fantabulous amalgam of no less than six different monster-movie concepts, low-budget effects, Christian Slater and crap. German uber-hack Uwe Boll shrugs off any shame in the crafting of this cinematic clinker and delivers an instantaneous (and unintentional) camp classic.\n\nFollow up to his 2003 zombie-lark HOUSE OF THE DEAD, Boll is back and proving fairly consistent, this being his second of two god-awful horror video game adaptations that provides more laughs than scares. In HOTD, Boll had almost zero budget, but made up for his technical limitations with a rotten script, lousy actors and a constant barrage of violence and sex. The genius of that film, however, lies in how boldly and unapologetically bad it is, and for the right audience, watching HOTD can be a great experience. ALONE IN THE DARK is much, much worse... and subsequently ten times more fun.\n\nThe \"x factor\" must lie in the amount of money those poor, witless European donors throw at Boll when he convinces them his movies will break even. This time the effects aren't bad, the action is polished, at least relative to HOUSE, and the actors are a lot better... known. Christian Slater delivers what should, God willing, be the defining performance of his dead career (either this or the Blockbuster exclusive PURSUED), bringing almost no weight or believability to his Ed Carnby, but a deliriously intense delivery on such lines as, \"No Hudgens! Don't be insane!\" Tara Reid can only be stared at for so long before you can almost see the dialog on the page as she drones on about whatever archaeological plot-furthering babble that her assistant museum curator (best joke in the whole movie) contributes. And Stephen Dorff is and always shall be very, very Stephen Dorff. The rest of the cast is filled out by one of the staples of a Boll film: random, untrained people off the street who bring a warm, campy quality to the backgrounds of each scene.\n\nBut the real star of this movie isn't the leads or the chatty extras; it isn't even the terribly familiar monsters (imagine H.R. Gieger's love child with a Velociraptor and Lon Chaney's makeup and you've got a very general idea of what they look like). No, ALONE's real star is Uwe Boll's direction. He masterfully guides this thinly-plotted tripe into utter oblivion and unavoidable audience confusion. In what could only have been born of a post-production, in the editing room, rough-cut's finished \"Oh crap!\" moment, the first three minutes of the film contains nothing but essential background information presented in a very engaging white text-scroll... and read aloud. It's kind of like STAR WARS... except not at all. You know you're in for a fun movie when the entire dose of antecedent information is dumped on you inside of the first three minutes (yes, it takes that long).\n\nIt's hard to tell where the visual aspect of the movie went wrong, as (only on a shot-by-shot basis) Uwe actually demonstrates some visual skill with the camera. However, once the shots get assembled together, AITD is a mess. The action scenes (especially a worthless fight between Slater and former-Sixers owner Pat Crocce) make BOURNE SUPREMACY look steady, the creature scenes are sloppy and lacking in continuity, and the shoot-outs are a bloody mess. Taking a page from EQUILLIBRIUM, Boll goes for the blinding-white-muzzle-flash-in-pitch-black aesthetic for one seemingly-endless sequence that actually gave me a headache. ALONE is a visual mess with only a handful of honestly good moments, and all of those are stolen from better pictures than this. I spotted \"homages\" to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, JURASSIC PARK, ALIEN and ALIENS, EVIL DEAD, the Watchowskis, Woo and Romero (for some reason there are zombies in this one, too). And each one is funnier than the last.\n\nIt should be noted that I haven't talked about the plot at all, which I've avoided doing thus far for several reasons. First of all, the plot is barely there as it is, and it provides enough solid belly-laughs that I wouldn't dare give away. Seconldy, I was laughing so much I honestly didn't catch much of the story, and what I did hear I barely understood. Thirdly, it's almost too ridiculous to summarize... but let me try. Christian Slater plays an orphan and once-agent of the secret government agency \"713,\" which is essential THE X-FILES with big guns... and in Canada. Slater, now in exile, tries to find pieces of his amnesiac past in an orphanage while simultaneously sleeping with Tara Reid, the aforementioned museum curator studying some fabricated Native American tribe of Satanic alchemists. Monsters. Guns. Crappy sex-scene. Hilarity.\n\nBoll has recently said that HOUSE OF THE DEAD was intentionally bad, a self-deprecating satire of zombie movies. He wishes. The fact of the matter is, the man couldn't make a good movie if Orson Wells himself came back from the dead and mentored him for a decade or two. However, what he can do is deliver D-material horror schlock that will absolutely enthrall anyone with either booze or a very masochistic sense of humor.\n\nOne Star out of Five for Quality (there are worse movies out there), but Five out of Five for MST3K-inspired joy.\n\n**(Anyone who makes the Marco Polo joke (the pool game, not the Spaniard) when a toss-away character named Marko bites it is forever in my debt. )"

        "review_detailed_main": "Following the discovery of ancient artifact, an investigator and a colleague learn that mystical beast has reappeared in the world and must find a way of stopping the creatures from entering the dimension.\n\nThis one was quite an enjoyable and underrated effort. One of the better elements with this one is the absolutely frantic and frenetic Action Movie-like pace here which really goes a long way towards making this one so enjoyable. This starts off really nicely here as the start of this one coincides with the car chase through the streets and the resulting series of brawls through the shops along the way offers a truly fine opening, the museum shootout is a lot of fun with the creatures coming into play nicely stalking them in the darkness while it makes use of a not only the exhibits but also the different interconnecting hallways for some great chases throughout here as they try to get away before the utter fun of the firefight from the military team that arrives to take them out and the confrontation in the house is even better with the different tactics of avoiding the creature being quite fun while again offering a lot to like in the fine gunfire and shoot-outs use to take the creatures down. As well, there's the finale here where this one really has a lot to like in the main attack against the team set-up outside with all kinds of gun-play to utilize in the situation even though there's the high-powered weaponry on display the creatures still break-through and slaughter the team in graphic fashion providing this with a thrilling sequence along the way. It also finishes up the rather fine part here of the underground adventures down in the pit where they discover the control facility and finally get the big resolution in play to end this on a fine note. These make the film enjoyable enough here to hold this off against the few minor flaws here. The main issue with this one is the absolutely confusing storyline here that makes no sense whatsoever throughout here, from the reasoning of the security council to need the children for the original experiment, why he had escaped as long as he had despite everyone knowing of his involvement, the reasoning for the creatures' appearance and the connection to the Indian tribe being just some of the questions raised here, and some of these are ones that impact that film a lot. The only other flaw to this one is the fact that there's really badly-done CGI that really doesn't offer much appeal here in making the creatures imposing and fearful here with the way they're depicted. There's still enough positives to like here to hold this one up.\n\nRated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and a clothed sex scene."

Well, no more jokes...\"Alone in the dark\" is a film that I just enjoyed a little because it has too much \"blackout\" scenes and the evolving of the movie itself it's too slow and not so action packed as they described..it's like a movie about people in a hospital for mental diseases..they have their own fears..voices in their heads and so on... Atari done a wrong choice for the filmmakers because \"Alone in the dark\" would have been a cooler movie with the direction of Guillermo Del Toro or another director of your choice that has the habit to work in dark atmospheres...I don't know what's the exact mood brought by the game but Uwe Boll had given that movie a Goth-Metal/Matrix imprint... So I can't give a vote less than 6 because with groups like Nightwish, In Flames and so on for the soundtrack, the \"Dark mood\" is well rendered and also if I didn't played the other chapters of the game, this movie is quite enjoyable...(maybe my neighbors, the Germans, liked it too much just only for their musical products included in this project (they are so proud of everything that is marked \"made in Germany\" and the German metal is the daily soundtrack in Germany)"

Its so bad that I had to fight to become awake enough to stand up and walk out of the theater. Guns are going off, things are blowing up, monsters are attacking, people are running and screaming and the audience is sleeping.\n\nPart of the problem is that the cast didn't so much phone in their performances rather they hired cardboard cut outs to do it for them. There is no life in anything they do. They don't care about whats going on so we don't either.\n\nThis is a movie for those who want to sleep and for no one else...well maybe those needing to see every movie monster ever created, but no one else.\n\n3 out of 10. Better than expected, but so painfully boring as to be unwatchable (simply because you will be sleeping)"

Slater is painfully wishing for his Kuffs days, trying to be the jaded wisecracker. Reid can't pronounce half the words that were churned out for her clich\u00e9 of a character, and Dorff's only purpose in this movie is to miss his cues and scream obscenities.\n\nThere is -no- valid argument to defend this movie; neither comedy nor schlock nor camp factors. Uwe Boll is a disgrace to the very concept of storytelling, regardless of the language he's in.\n\nIf you went to see this movie: my condolences.

        "review_detailed_main": "A hundred thousand years or so when the moon doth glow there comes a film so horrendously bad it's fantastic. One of those cinematic experiences that forces you to simply laugh hysterically, rolling in the aisles at the utter farce and feeble attempts at film-making. From the music and editing to the directing and oh-so-stellar acting, the film becomes ingrained in your memory as one of those all-time \"so bad it's good\" films to cherish forever...\n\nALONE IN THE DARK is not one of those films.\n\nAlone in the Dark is such a horrid film that the notions of character growth, suspense, or even plot don't even come into play. The film is utterly pointless, as the entire plot and all its secrets are divulged in the \"Romping Room Story Time\" at the beginning, where a laughably bored narrator reads a five-minute long short story with the passion of a Prozak junkie that makes Ben Stein seem like a Shakespearan thespian. The film might have well just taken the actual script and voice actors from the video game and just added beginning and end credits. There is no horror for the horror buffs. No suspense for the suspense buffs. No impressive special or visual effects that couldn't find on my XBox, and certainly no sex (just bluntly obvious dry humping with a bra-clad Tara Reid in a scene as sexually titilizing as watching a one-eyed, three-legged badger hump my refrigerator), and quality acting equal to...let's say, a car dealership commercial.\n\nSo, in short, this film is essentially a true testament (along with such winners as Racing Stripes) that Hollywood has officially ran out of ideas, and was so desperate to spend money that ALONE IN THE DARK was just ripe for the picking. However, there is a great upside of this magnificently atrocious film. It makes you dumber. Much dumber, and hopefully after enough marathon viewings of Racing Stripes and Alone in the Dark, Hollywood may achieve its ultimate goal of lowering our IQs and expectations to such an extent that this movie, and all other movies like 3 Fast 3 Furious surely due out next Summer, will seem good and entertaining and life-affirming. So keep on trying Hollywood. You're not there yet, but you're on the right track! A for effort."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, let's get one thing straight first of all...\n\nThis movie S.U.C.K.S.\n\nThe acting in particular is merely the second most awful thing in the film. Slater is Slater on a shoestring budget, as is Dorff. But TARA REID cannot act and is entirely miscast as the anthropologist curator-type person. Page One, uwe Boll, if your lead actress can't pronounce her character's occupation without being laughed at, you're in trouble.\n\nWhich leads me to the worst thing: Director Uwe Boll. House of the Dead stank to high heaven. But what i am wondering is this - can we really trust a guy who puts \"An Uwe Boll Film\" in the opening credits to figure out intelligent or creative input into his movie? And what about that 1 and a half minutes of scrolling narrated text at the beginning of the film. It's as if he wants to bore people before it's started. It's completely unnecessary.\n\nHowever, I do believe there are a lot more worse goings-on than all this. I am thinking that, with Alone in the Dark, there may be some money laundering going on. It reminds me of Mel Brook's producers - if you make a bad production and shut it down, perhaps you can make a killing. Is it pessimistic of me to suggest that the $20 million spent on the film is done so to create a failure of a movie by shooting in cheap Vancouver and deliberatley ruin a movie by miscasting, both behind and in front of the camera? Are there ulterior motives at work here? At the time of writing this the movie has generously opened at #14 in the charts on its hopelessly unchallenging first weekend in January and has scraped a mere 5% of it back. By the time it hits video stores, it will recoup most of it, no matter how viciously ripped apart it gets from the critics.\n\nI mean, come on, there must be *some* explanation for this incredible miss-step of a movie.\n\nAnd now I hear that Uwe Boll is making Bloodrayne and Farcry - two more movies that are taken directly from video games. It's clear to me that such a talentless team helmed by an even more talentless director haven't learnt a damn thing and show no signs of improving. How can they continue to work and produce this crap in such high volume? There must be some explanation.\n\nThere definitely must be an apology.\n\n1/10"

But this movie was great to enjoy if you are looking for a movie where you can shut down your brains and just look at it. I saw House of the Dead and I hated it. It was one of the worst zombie movies ever made. Having played the game Alone in the Dark, I did enjoy this movie. Sure allot of things were wrong: the plot holes, the directing, etc... It is great to see Tara Reid do things that she wouldn't normally do. Most directors wouldn't cast Reid as a scientist, but here she does play one and you have to respect her decision to do such a thing. I mainly rented this movie for the idea that this movie was based upon a video game and I wanted to see how he did it. Another reason were Stephen Dorf, Tara Reid and Christian Slater. I like seeing them on screen, so I wasn't disappointed in their acting abilities. They did give the best of their abilities under the direction of a director who isn't a A-class director. This movie can be compared to Van Helsing, the Mummy Trilogy and many other movies who are nothing more than mere entertainment and should be viewed as such. They aren't a masterpiece. Alone in the Dark is a action-horror movie with the emphasis on action and not survival-horror like in the game. It is great to see that Uwe Boll does take on the challenge to direct movies, mainstream Hollywood wouldn't do. Or the fact that Boll is not afraid to deviate from the game storyline. Perhaps in the near future, someone in Hollywood might come up with the idea to remake those Uwe Boll's movies and possibly even do it better than he does. But for now, we will have to do with Boll making movies based upon games. It's a acquired taste, this man's movies. I do hope that the next movies will be more quality than quantity, but I fear it would be the opposite."

The camera was dynamic, incorporating some very nice tracking shots and aerial photography. This helped carry the momentum so that the pace was not broken.\n\nUwe Boll has received a lot of criticism for this film, but it does not deserve to be in the \"Worst 100 films of all time\". Uwe is a competent director who vision of films is instantly dismissed by people drawn in by the hype of the prejudice reviews. Give this film a go and make up your own mind.\n\nIt has the feel of a smaller scale Aliens or Starship Troopers and while it is not in their league, is still an enjoyable watch."

As his experiments come to a close, one of the orphans, named Edward Carnby, escapes and makes off into the wild to live free from Hudgens' controlling influence.\n\nNow fully grown, Carnby dedicates his life to exploring paranormal activity across the globe. Once a member of the secret government unit Bureau 713, he has become a one-man agency, and finds that his latest discovery, a small ring-shaped artifact, may hold the key to a recent increase in paranormal activity around the world. Reuniting with his estranged archaeologist girlfriend Aline Cedrac, Carnby begins to search for answers and hopefully save the world.\n\nWhat he soon discovers is that Bureau 713, led by Agent Richard Burke, is similarly aware of the recent surge in activity, and determined to find the same solution he now frantically searches for. Reluctantly joining with Burke, Carnby begins to unravel the web of mystery that surrounds his artifact, Professor Hudgens, and even himself. As more and more evidence of a connection appears between his own past and that of Bureau 713, Carnby must decide whether to help save his friends \u0096 and possibly the entire human race \u0096 or abandon them to uncover the long-hidden truths for which he's been searching all of his life.\n\nNow for the record, I have heard and read many stories about people walking out on bad movies but never actually witnessed it. Well, now I can saw I have. About half way into the flick, two people walked out of the theater that only had about ten people in it tops. And to be honest, it wasn't going to get any better. I have read so many, countless, reviews on this movie being God awful. I was really counting on this one to be good. I wanted to see it so bad, and I wanted to love it so much. But I can't.\n\nThe film is far from being the \"Worst movie ever made\" that so many people are making it out to be though. Bare in mind, the mad man that is responsible for the turd that House Of The Dead made this flick, you'll most likely get a rough idea of what not to expect. Uwe Boll seems to have improved his direction slightly with this one, and for the better. The movie is not completely mindless, as House Of The Dead obviously was. Tara Reid's performance was god awful, and thankfully, despite her having second bill, she does not over power the film.\n\nSlater and Dorff have definitely seen better days. This movie is probably their worst as a matter of fact. I assume a few dead presidents had something to do Slater's and Dorff's involvement in this flop. I mean, the script isn't exactly Casablanca. But then again, but movie is? I have a feeling I'm going to be flagged with many negative comments because of this review. I do like this movie.\n\nWhat I like about it is that the action is not constant, but rather it builds more on suspense and horror rather than blood and gore. Boll's direction is quite unique. It's become a little professional than his ladder House Of The Dead, which relied souly on mindless action. He seems to be able to make you jump on some scenes which he tried to do in House Of The Dead, but ultimately, he fell on his face with a ridiculous silly action flick that tries too hard to scare with action and gore rather than building up suspense. He succeeds with the suspense here.\n\nOverall, Boll is bad director, and he just chooses bad projects. House Of The Dead was one of them. Alone In The Dark was also a bad choice, but he seems to have found to a way to approach this film differently than House Of The Dead (I can't put my finger on it, but it's there) and hopefully he gets better at it for his next films, BloodRayne, Far Cry etc. Which I am anxiously awaiting. I'm ready to see what Mr. Boll will have up his sleeve for his following films. Hopefully he WILL improve on BloodRayne.\n\nMy conclusion is simply this: Uwe Boll's career is soon to end in America, I'm not afraid to say. The man simply cannot direct. A blind mute has better direction than Boll's movies for crying out loud. But he does know how to entertain. And unfortunately, that is pretty much all Hollywood has to offer us right now, and Alone In The Dark succeeds on that level, yet fails on almost every other. I'm on the fence with this movie. I can easily say I enjoy it, but won't bother with it until the DVD arrives. If that. The ending is what really bummed me out. If you see it, you'll know what I mean.\n\n**1/2/*****\n\nP.S. Yes, this is a positive review, and No, I'm not Uwe Boll."

Alone in the Dark is the equivalent of taking 50 million dollars, wiping your ass with it, and smearing it all over a movie screen, thats pretty much what I saw anyway. It shocks me to think of how many people in the midst of this movie being made never once questioned what the hell this guy was doing. The only thing remarkably forgiving is the brilliant and uncredited performance of Greg Sylvester as the pot-smoking slacker. All in all, if you want to make movies that you thought sucked look good, go see this thing that for some reason people claim is a movie."

However, considering that people said Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse were crap, and I loved those two films, curiosity got the better of me and I had to have a look. Overall, Alone In The Dark isn't too bad. Sure, the acting was a bit cheesy, and yes, there were a few mistakes and confusing action scenes with clich\u00e9'd heavy metal music thrown into it, but as a popcorn film, it was quite good. I would classify it as a big, dumb action film. Not much plot, but the action sequences and special effects were rather good, so that saved this film, for me. The only thing I didn't like about the film was the ending. It was too sudden and unbelievable. I expected a bit more.\n\nOh, and am I the only one that rolled their eyes at the use of Nenh Cherry's \"Seven Seconds\" during the sex scene?"

If you have actually played the game, the only thing you will recognize is the main character's name, Edward Carnby, other than that, this movie is nothing like the game. which is too bad. From what I remember of playing the game, even with the graphics which, while advanced for the time, really didn't look realistic at all, being so boxy and game play being pretty straight forward and frustrating, it still managed to give you enough surprises to keep you on the edge of you seat as you played it. Movie execs should look at the first Resident Evil, the the following it has developed when converting games to movies. In that one, they just took a plot that they knew worked (because it had sold thousands if not millions of copies of that game) and put it on the big screen. Over all, this movie was just disappointing."

This can also apply if a film looks like it will be so bad on some campy level it will actually be quite good fun. This is what inspired me to give Alone in the Dark a pop, a film that received a monumental amount of bad reviews but which I got the idea might be good fun on some zany level or the other. Afraid not.\n\nThe 'plot', sketchy and apathetic as it is, has Christian Slater as Edward Cardwell, a 'paranormal expert' who arrives in Los Angeles to do some work with some ancient artifacts from an ancient civilization called the Abkani. On his arrival, he is promptly chased by a mysterious assailant with seemingly superhuman power who tries to kill him. Paranormal experts must naturally possess the fighting skills to fend off big, bulky, aggressive attackers, for he comes out of this unscathed and promptly sets off to do his work. He meets back up with his old flame professor (Tara Reid) and learns more about the artifacts. From here on in the plot is basically just a confused, senseless mish mash about supernatural powers, a murderous beast, personal possession of the a'facts for personal power and an intrusive FBI agent (Stephen Dorff) who has a beef with Caldwell and tries to sort the mysterious goings on out his way.\n\nIt has to be said it's been a long time since a film like Alone in the Dark came along which got all the right ingredients for a bad film together so perfectly. Hilariously bad acting, awful story, terrible editing, bad casting (Reid as professor?) and a bad sex scene where Youssou N' Dour's 1994 hit 7 Seconds plays rather viciously as Slater and Reid dabble in some really light porn.\n\nIndeed, without knowing anything about him, I'd like to give director Uwe Boll the benefit of the doubt and credit him as a reasonably intelligent man. It's hard to see how he could have seen the script for this unspeakable travesty and not seen what a badly written, incomprehendible, ineffective pile of pong it is. Indeed, you get the impression he must have known what a bad film it was and just made it as a parody of what a really bad film should be like. If you want to check it out on a so bad it's hilarious level, by all means go ahead. Just let yourself in for one REALLY bad film. NO STARS"

I also think that overall they did a pretty good job on this movie. They even scored some fairly well known actors for parts. However, even though I did somewhat enjoy this movie, I was left feeling a bit unfulfilled at the end.\n\nThis is not a movie that deserves a sequel, and there is no definitive conclusion to the story at the end of the movie. I also got the feeling that the movie was rushed into production and completion. Many of the so-called \"action\" scenes, were decent, but could have been a lot better with more time and care spent into drawing the viewer into them.\n\nThe basis for this movie could have produced a movie that left people gripped to their seats in terror throughout the entire adrenaline rush of the film. Instead, they made several classic mistakes. Given the story of the movie, they should have done a much more \"first season X-Files\" approach to things. Meaning simply, scare you by what you don't see, instead of what you do. Make the audience guess...\"did I really see that?\", \"did I see what I thought I saw?\", etc.\n\nThe actors did an overall good job on their parts, but again, it wasn't that easy to get into the movie, because they didn't do a whole lot of character development. So, it was hard for the audience to get into \"caring for\" and \"fearing for\" the various characters in the film.\n\nOverall, I'd say this was a fun movie to watch, but it fell very short of what it could have been. It could have been a movie that made the Resident Evil series look like something for a 1st grader. Instead it came across as something that just left you wanting."

Quite patriotic of her, don't you think?\n\nIn an instant, it is some twenty years later. The boy is a treasure hunter now (or something like that, it is never really revealed) and has to flee again. This time the villains are after an artifact that he found, that can open the door to a dark dimension full of demons. So far with the story, there isn't actually much more to it, really.\n\nThe movie has all the clich\u00e9s, that a mystery thriller cannot live without: beasts, experiments on humans, unmarked helicopters, liquid-filled ammo (seems to be a new trend), mad scientists, some geek handing out cool equipment and dark places of course.\n\nThe characters change their attitudes toward each other within the blink of an eye from rage to ... Now, what do you think? There MUST be a sex scene in every Hollywood-movie, right?\n\nChristian Slater: The character of Christian Slater stays shallow all the while. Did he ever express grief, compassion, fear, doubt or terror? Maybe yes, had they only shown his face close-up now and then. Okay, he has some mildly amusing scenes, but that's it. That's not enough to get in touch with a character or feel with him. Sorry, Chris, I'm sure next time you will be in the movie that brings you back! Tara Reid: Plays an archaeologist. She really looks cool in that movie, giving it an interesting look, but not much more. Her acting is sufficient. Stephen Dorff: Poor guy! He ruled in Blade and in some other cool movies. What are you doing in this dark place? Still, Stephen is the one with the most vivid character.\n\nThe sidekicks are mostly cannon fodder with no given personalities. They just seem to fall and stumble through the badly written script, which does not offer possibilities for them to show that they are sophisticated human beings. If only they did it with some style, it would be easily excusable. Hint to the script writer: Just add a little tic or habit or attitude to them (adds a huge amount of life and makes us feel sorry for them, if they die).\n\nThe logic in this movie seems to be beyond my intellectual abilities. Or is there none? It seems to me they put the characters together by force. Not to speak of the story threads that they introduced but never finished. Sometimes I just sat in the theater and thought: 'What the hell is this scene for?' Sometimes it's even worse than just the usual \"What, there is a monster? I think we should split up!\" And I can stand A LOT if I am at least entertained well, which wasn't the case here.\n\nThe director does his job. He is not really gifted, but he can let a guy hold a camera. Wild, disturbing camera movements in the fight scenes are common nowadays, alright. So the action scenes are okay, sometimes even good, but did he ever work with actors before? Actors act and The Man makes sure, that the camera gets it. You should improve your abilities here. Just my opinion.\n\nThe editor must have been living in a very dark place, too. It seems he made a pact with the script writer to ruin the story of the movie. Sometimes, when the camera fixes on a person, you think: Now it's time for the actor to show what he's paid for. Half a second later there's a cut. Huh? Humor is there too, slick one-liners and so on, but nothing memorable at all.\n\nThe creature effects were quite nice in the way that the beasts flashed between visible and invisible. I liked that. The music was okay, but sometimes strained my endurance. A little more subtlety would have been better. Too bad poor Nightwish had to crown the end credits with their beautiful music. This movie ends as always nowadays, open to a sequel (hope there will be none).\n\nSummary: Don't waste your precious money on that movie! Now and then I even expressed my discontent with the movie to my neighbor, which I NEVER did before in my life! At least I didn't leave the theater. Total Time Toilet. Therefore: 3 *\n\nWatch in cinema? No Rent it? It you have nothing better to do in your life Buy it? Are you kidding?"

        "review_detailed_main": "To call Alone in the Dark a movie would probably be generous. It is a movie in the sense that events were filmed with a motion picture camera, are edited together and is projected in a theater screen. However, one significant aspect of a real movie, featuring a story, is completely lacking in Alone in the Dark. It is a plot-less, indecipherable mess that goes through the motions of being about something for an hour and a half and then is over.\n\nAny attempt to actually describe anything that goes on during the film's running time would most likely be fruitless, but I will attempt: Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a paranormal investigator (with only one change of clothes I might add) who has uncovered an artifact that holds the key to opening a door to another dimension (I think) that is being pursued by a scientist working for the covert Bureau 713, a paranormal investigation division on the government, although the current manager of the Bureau, Burke Richards (Stephen Dorff) is unaware of the nefarious plot under his nose and attempting to stop this scientist from opening the doorway also.\n\nThat brief synopsis is the best I can piece together from my viewing experience of the film, and if it seems under-explained and not quite complete, that is because the film is the same way: under-explained and not quite complete. The actors here are just going through motions of scenes and reciting dialog as if it meant something when it doesn't really. I never felt I had a good grasp on anything that was happening in the film, and kept waiting for the next scene to start explaining things, and that scene and explanation never came.\n\nOn the technical end, Alone in the Dark is at least competent. The visual effects of the various otherworldly creatures is decent, the film doesn't look supremely low-budget (although I am sure it is), and it boasts, while not a stellar cast, one that has at least some name recognition. Unfortunately, most of the cast is wasted in this film, and at least some of the supporting actors turn in some rather horrible performances, especially Tara Reid as an assistant museum curator and Carnby's girlfriend. Her dialog delivery is poor and doesn't really make much of an impression.\n\nAs the film progresses, it's pretty obvious that the filmmakers are channeling better movies like Aliens (with it's massive firefight between creatures and soldiers) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (possessed humans by alien creatures), but doesn't come close to approximating the good aspects of either of those films. In the end, Alone in the Dark is an hour and half exercise in attempting to make a buck off very little effort. If the film makes back it's cost, it will, unfortunately, have succeeded. Just so there isn't an Alone in the Dark 2."

Can it be that bad? Well.......\n\nThing's start off badly with a ridiculously long Star Wars style scroll which is also spoken in case you can't read.We are then straight into a car chase including box's of vegetables getting hit, how's that for a clich\u00e9? then a fight, with loads of slo-mo camera work, resulting in the death of the bad guy which seems to go un-noticed in the market place! Christian Slater is unfortunate to be the star of this turkey with Tara Reid co-staring as his girlfriend who is an archaeologist, you can tell she's clever as she wears glasses and her hair in a bob, though she does spend most of the movie running around in a naval revealing tank top.She was obviously hired for her looks and not her acting ability as she plainly has none, I can't recall such a wooden performance for some time! The movie meanders on at a snails pace, we get a pointless and utterly gratuitous love scene, then some monster's appear and a SWAT style team,lead by the dreadful Stephen Dorff, spend the rest of the movie trying to kill them and the movie turns into a dreadful low grade Aliens style flick-but without the horror and suspense!

It had all the right ingredients, but poor direction resulted in a movie that disappointed from the first frame. Why was it necessary to have five minutes of exposition text at the beginning of the film to explain background details that were explained later in the film? Why was it necessary to have that exposition text read? If it had to be read, why could it not be read by an actor with a talent for voice acting? Why is the use of voice-overs by the Carnby character so inconsistent? And those are just the questions I was asking in the first 10 minutes of the film. If this film had been made by a competent director, I would probably have given it at least a 5 or 6. Unfortunately, poor directorial decisions completely ruined what could have been an interesting film."

Tara reid's transformation from museum geek to gun-slinging lara croft teamed with a paranormal investigating indiana jones (slater) is just too much.\n\nThe story is idiotic and borrows from many sources, including tomb raider (unabashedly so) so there is nothing original about it. The plot is full of holes, barney the dinosaur and the teletubbies have a better plot than this!!!

There's no real point in discussing the movie, if that's what it is. Just because you see moving images when you press play doesn't mean it's a film. There's money here, you can tell, which makes it even worse. So many daring, imaginative filmmakers out there would love to have had this budget. But no, Boll is given yet another project to insult moviegoers. When Boll makes personal appearances he does get crowds, people just love to have their photo taken with him and get his autograph. I'm personally offended by this practice in that it only encourages him. Truly bad movie making should not be praised or encouraged. There are bad films out there that are fun, we appreciate the effort, especially if the filmmaker was sincere but fell short. But this is just another example of a man's insistence on his talent, confident in his abilities, arrogant in the face of audience reaction, time after time. I see in the trivia he blames the script. OK. This mess should come with a manual and some sort of medication. Boll is making Zombie Massacre due out in 2010. May God Have Mercy On Our Souls."

Boll is the King of Video Game Movies.\n\nBoll treats AitD with a tenderness not generally found in movies of this genre. While other movies based on games are often very tongue-in-cheek, Boll takes his work very seriously (though he maintains a sense of humour.) Fans of House of the Dead will be happy to see that AitD had more budget to work with. The special effects are on par with most horror movies these days, and there are recognizable actors in the cast (Christian Slater, Tara Reid, et al.) It's really nice to see Boll shine when he is given more space to move in.\n\nThe movie had some great action sequences featuring motion-activated gattling guns and helicopters. It is very obvious that to Boll action should be fast-paced and include lots of bullets, and I agree.\n\nI'm tired of all these 'serious' horror movies that feature some single mom and her kid being chased around by barely visible ghosts. I don't want to watch The Ring being ripped off over and over again. I want to sit back and watch guys shoot the holy hell out of big scary things that are ripping them apart. I want giant explosions and helicopters. Uwe Boll gives me what I want every time, and I adore him for it. God Bless you, Herr Boll."

Honestly compared to movies today this movie wasn't gorey really at all. There were only two or three scenes I would even remotely call gorey and it was cheesy enough that it didn't bother me. An autopsy is naturally gonna be \"gorey\" but it was very mild. A spine ripped in half and a head cut in half was a bit nasty but again still very cheesy. The movie had some epic scenes in it. One of my favorites being a war between the soldiers and the creatures while metal music played and flashes of gunfire and attacks went on in music video style. It was incredible. And the whole thing was quite nostalgic. Some of the cgi was even fantastic for that time. Honestly I enjoyed it. Interesting storyline, some of the choices were weird and there was one death that didn't make much sense. I saw this on tubi and there was no sex scene so if your wanting the hard-core gore and added sex scenes that's gonna be in the German version of the film. You'll enjoy this movie just give it a chance."

The problems are much of the same as House of the Dead: crappy acting, a broken story, and wrongly being labeled a real movie.\n\nProbably the worst part of the movie is the story. It starts off with five minutes of text, talking about some ancient civilization and monsters living in darkness. This is the most understandable part of the story. The rest makes absolutely no sense what so ever. Random monsters, random soldiers, random explosions, and random deaths mark the rest of this broken excuse for a movie. This train wreck of a story is laughable, until you realize that you are on the train.\n\nThe characters in the movie have the personality of gum stuck on the bottom of your shoe, which only makes it more desirable to see them die. The actors portray no real signs of human emotion, and mostly look like they are there for a quick buck. It's sad, as Christain Slater can do so much better. Tara Reid, on the other hand, is simply in the movie because she looks great, which doesn't make up for her crappy acting. Boll might want to consider getting real actors for his next movie. Golly, that might help!\n\nGranted watching this movie with a few buddies is extremely funny, but only because there are so many jokes to be made at this movie's expense. Watching this by yourself is harmful to your health, and may cause uncontrollable rage, intense feelings of stomach flu, and a fist through the TV. You have been warned."

In fact, she had put House of the Dead on the queue too, but I managed to talk her out of that one (me: \"It has clips from the video game in it! Like, not part of the story or anything, just random clips from the game!\").\n\nNow, shall I detail the film's unnumbered failings, or just describe that watching-a-train-wreck curiosity that kept the disc in our DVD player for the full running time? How about Tara Reid in the ever popular \"sexy bookworm\" role? She's playing basically the same role that Rachel Weisz did in The Mummy and Elizabeth Shue did in The Saint, except Reid is even less believable.\n\nDoes it matter that the story is ridiculous? Movies like Alone in the Dark exist outside of logic. It seems as if the producers were full of contempt for the intended audience. I try never to assume malice where incompetence is an equal possibility, but my gut goes with malice on this one.\n\nMovies that are so bad they're good usually seem to be made with some sort of joy. There is no campy joy in Alone in the Dark. The magic of Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space is, he honestly thought it was a masterpiece in the making. Somehow I doubt anyone involved with this picture had the same notion. I feel worse for having seen it, and I'll never get those 96 minutes of my life back. Curse you, Uwe Boll!"

Tara Reid may be better for teenie movies (I loved her in \"American Pie\"), but Stephen Dorff (great in \"Blade\" and of course in Britney's music video :-) did a good job. Christian Slater, the main character, also was quite strong (better than in \"Mindhunters\"). After reading other comments, I'm quite surprised, that the feedback is so low. The movie is obviously not exactly like the game, but there is no reason to watch it if you played the game (like I did)."

It's a combination of everything like the Matrix and The Aliens and the horror movies and EST. It's more like a cheap move with poor acting especially about the first role Christian Slater. In some scenes we hear his narrations as an element of expanding the story of the film. As far as I concerned the story is not much complicated which needs more explanations!! It's reminds me the Blade runner when we hear the narrations of the Harrison ford throughout the film. In this film this element helps us to find out more about the story and what is going on there. It's more like the old noir movies in that film.\n\nBut I think the scene which we see those agents are fighting against those creatures are interesting and relieves our pains a little!! I find this movie awfully bad and never suggest anyone to see it for fun or anything."

When they infected the scientist, were you not expecting him to play a major part in Slater's downfall (given he WAS one of the few people he trusted anymore) yet he did not appear for the rest of the film.

I think I fell asleep in the middle of it actually. Then i woke up when i heard the sexual tension music and all of a sudden Reid and Slatter were doing it. And that scene was so random! On the case of the movie it said that Reid was Slaters ex, yet i found that very hard to believe considering IT WAS NEVER MENTIONED! And the part(s) that made me realize that renting this movie was the dumbest thing i have ever done was the first shooting scene when they all looked like people from a video game doing the story line sequence, and the part when they are in the lab after they open the door and are trying to close it, it looked like Slater had forgotten his moves or something because he runs away from the closing door, then runs back and pretends to hold it open while the Dorff \"runs\" out,(he even through in some grunts to make it sound like the door was powerful) when clearly Dorff was in no danger of getting stuck behind the closed door. I laughed.\n\nAnyway, I have seen some pretty bad movies, you know those ones that never make it into theaters they are just played on HBO in the weirdo section of On Demand. This has got to be one of the worst. All the acting and gore was just so unbelievable. Last House on the Left gets a better rating than this.\n\nI feel bad for Stepen Dorff, he was in Cold Creek Manor and that was pretty decent, then he was thrown into this mess. Well we all get a little desperate sometimes right?"

        "review_detailed_main": "From the director of House of the Dead? When I first saw AITD, I was unfamiliar to Uwe Boll, the director. I was interested in the film, so naturally I chose to see what people were saying about it on IMDb. I was shocked at what I read! First and for foremost: Uwe Boll has established himself; most people know of him. Why? Terrible movies? I don't think so.\n\nDr. Boll and his work have been bashed from every angle,and some unjustifiable and rude comments have been made. People seem to find themselves in the following of \"Boll Bashers\" whom can't stand his work.\n\nWhy? Is it because Dr. Boll doesn't give up? Because he makes movies that some don't like? I don't think so. I think it's a trend. See Boll, Bash Boll; no true justification. Lay off the terrible, direct insults.\n\nSecond: The Film ***may contain spoilers*** Alone in the Dark. I do believe that there was a miss-casting w/ characters and some things didn't seem to original (story), but I won't ignore the fact that it had some awesome shots and nice character models and creature effects.\n\nThe battles between the creatures were interesting, and cool, but I think what lost people was it's darkness. Yes, the film was dark; literally. Some shots, you couldn't make out what was happening. For instance: The final battle w/ the 713 soldiers and the creatures, there were some cool gore effects, but they were hard to see due to the lighting.\n\nThe cool thing about this movie is the actual look and feel. The film possessed a very 90's creature-feature feel... what's that? The 90's was full of creature films that used the a lot of CGI w/out puppeteers. AITD some what uses this idea because there was very few puppeteers in it. But it was cool, and I liked the creature's design.\n\nThird: See it.\n\nWatch the movie and form an unbiased opinion. I know most will not love it, but I can't see everyone hating it...\n\nI own the DVD. I love it.\n\nWhy? The special features and commentary.\n\nEver watched one of those commentaries and all they talk about it \"yogurt\" or personal, stupid stuff? Well... Dr. Boll's is not like that! He actually talks about the film, the technical aspects, his feelings, and his true thoughts of the film business.\n\nFourth: Hate it or like it! Hate it or like it, is that what AITD is about? I am not going to sit here and explain the reasons why one would hate it, because truthfully, it has its downsides, but looking at the glass half full is better.\n\nAll in all: The film has entertaining moments and dull ones too. It's a quick ride... fun and interesting.\n\nWatch it.... if you don't like it, move on.\n\nBTW, I can't wait for Bloodrayne :) -JVL"

(Daniel Cudmore also cameoed Colossus in X-Men 2) and because of my fondness for him I didn't walk out after the first 20 minutes. I would only recommend seeing this movie if you have a loyalty to one of the actors or to the video game itself. I haven't ever played the game so I cannot speak to whether it was true to it or not.

        "review_detailed_main": "Since I live in Sweden, I wasn't even aware that this movie had been released until my boyfriend so kindly showed me IMDb to then discover all this negative criticism. So I decide to BUY the movie and see it for myself if it actually could be THAT bad. To then discover that it's like any other Video Game movie. Resident Evil and the follower Resident Evil: Apocalypse is video game based movies that has an actress who started her career as a model. Now, Tara Reid has actually worked within commercials. I'm not saying that it makes her a better actor, but please, she is better then Sarah Michelle Gellar who plays Buffy - the big blonde vampire slayer. They even made a follow up and movies out of Buffy. Who wants to see a follow up on her demonic boyfriend Angel who can be compared with Vin Diesel's so called \"acting\". None of them can act. Angel probably even acts better then Vin Diesel and guess what those two has in common! Bad acting and good looks! So what if we would see a follow up on Aline Cedrac? Alone with Aline? Or Alone with Aline: 2? My point is exactly that no one cares about acting in an \"all action\" movie or series! They want to see blondes and good-looking guys that kicks some bad guys/girls in a amazing way!\n\nSo there are a few glitches in the story, but this movie should have been a longer movie with more background. Other from that, I can't see what there is to complain about. All in all, who can make a Vide Game better then this or then Resident Evil? I doubt anyone could do this movie better when it comes to effects and actresses or actors. All that is needed, is someone who could have directed them more. Because to blame the actor to be bad is easy, but this is not one of those movies where they lack in talent. This is a movie where the one to blame is Uwe Boll, because he should have used the actors and the actress to give their full ambition in this movie. So, if any of you out there, is so sure that this movie is bad, I would like to know how you ever could get a Video Game movie as the games. Because I am sure that no one can make a video game movie as good as the video game.\n\nSo all I can see is a lack of directing and story. Other from that, this movie is completely action! And that what was I expected. Because that's what video games is about, right? And I believe Tara Reid acts better then that character on your video game. So unless your character in the game can give such a pretty face as Tara Reid can then you have nothing on the Alone in the Dark-movie. If you didn't want anyone to put a face on your characters, then you should keep yourself to the video game and not the movie. In which, I doubt you would even play the game if it wouldn't contain action.\n\nIt's an action movie. What did you expect? What Uwe Boll did, was to make the game into a action movie. A >action< movie. I want to point out that the action movie contains special effects, monsters and a lot of guns and >action<. So if you didn't know, a video game being all action and being made into all action can't be as bad as everyone points out.\n\nI like it. Why? Because I bought an action movie and got an action movie.\n\nIf there were one movie that was the biggest joke in the universe it would be \"Boa vs. Python\" and not at all \"Alone in the dark\"."

The soundtrack is absolutely boring and at times it seems like music was just added to fill in space, rather than thought out to move along with the scenes. I give this movie the extra star for the decent background scenery and setup. Final words of thought, I am a huge \"sci-fi /suspense\" fan and hate seeing a name as the main seller of the movie (the game title). Please, take some old 70's & 80's sci-fi /suspense pictures and learn how to make a real movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alone in the Dark is a disappointment, but it's in a way you might not expect. Some movies fail to live up to the hype of their praise, but this is a rare breed of movie that fails to live up to the hype of its ridicule. I wanted it to be so bad that it was good, but unfortunately, it doesn't even \"succeed\" on that level. It has its moments, but rather than sustaining a constant stream of \"entertainingly awful badness,\" it just starts to drag and becomes a chore to finish sitting through. Folks, I've seen Troll 2, and Alone in the Dark - you are no Troll 2.\n\nI don't recommend paying money to see this (and thank goodness I didn't), so I'll be kind enough to point out some of the highlights: * The movie starts off with a 60-second scroll text. A narrator, who sounds a lot like David Carradine, reads it to us. Feel free to read along! Since this is loosely based on a video game, one can only assume that Boll wanted us to experience all the *COUGH* excitement *COUGH* of reading an instruction manual. Brilliant.\n\n* At the beginning of the movie, Slater is sleeping on a plane and is having a dream about his past when he was part of a group of 20 orphans who were used for some weird experiments 22 years ago. When he wakes up, a bad kid actor barely manages to ask him if he had nightmares. Slater mumbles something about, \"Yeah, I had this dream that my agent let me accept a role in a Uwe Boll mov...\" but before Slater can finish his sentence the scene is cut. Very choppy editing if you ask me.\n\n* Tara Reid is an assistant museum curator/archaeologist. You may have the tendency to read that sentence and scoff, but please keep in mind that she wears glasses and puts her hair in a bun. We all know that automatically equates to intelligence. Unfortunately, she fails to convince us of any sign of said intelligence as she spits out every line with such a lack of emotion that you just know she had memorized it five seconds ago and was doing her very best to say it without messing up. \"Edward. It. is. so. good. to. see. you. again.\" * A huge creature with inhuman strength chases Slater and Reid into a room at the museum. They close the door and Slater yells at Tara to lock it. This creature just penetrated a dude's skull and is rampaging through the museum, destroying everything it touches, but a locked door is gonna stop it? * Welcome to the world of awkward, out-of-place make out scenes. Out of nowhere, Slater and Reid start rekindling their old flame on a bed at the museum. Was that supposed to be an ancient artifact? King Tut's bed, perhaps? Or does the museum just keep a bed with silk sheets handy? * Don't you just love big fight scenes that consist of CGI creatures, loud heavy metal music, lots of darkness, and a little gunfire flash? It's by design. You can't see or figure out what's going on, so I can only assume that Boll lives by the \"if you can't see it, then you can't judge it too harshly\" philosophy.\n\n* There's an agent in the movie named Pinkerton. Agent Pinkerton? Come on. They should've had a sheriff named \"Marshall Law.\" * There weren't nearly as many cheesy lines as there should've been, but Slater did manage to reel off a handful of stupid ones like, \"Something tells me we're not the first ones down here,\" as he stares at an obviously MAN-MADE wall. Well thank you, Master of the Bloody Obvious. Those human skulls adorning the walls may have been a tip-off as well.\n\n* Why in the world are the soldiers setting a timer on a bomb to explode in 8 seconds. 8 seconds? Ever heard of giving yourself a few seconds to FLEE TO SAFETY?!?!?! Or was this a subtle, yet-oh-so-clever homage to the 1994 Luke Perry/Stephen Baldwin Lane Frost biopic? * There's no way you can keep from laughing at what is possibly the absolute worst song to play over ending credits I've ever heard in a movie. Some band called Nightwish starts belting out, \"I WISH I HAD AN ANGEL\" and Mr. Shade and I immediately started doing bad Dokken impersonations. I was spinning around, doing haymakers with a fake guitar, and Mr. Shade was laying some heavy beats on his imaginary drum set. There IS entertainment value to be found in songs that sound like they came straight out of the 1980s heavy metal genre; you just have to look for it.\n\nIt's pretty sad when you're sitting in the theater thinking, \"You know, this movie would've been far more entertaining with Jean Claude Van Damme delivering bad one-liners in his broken English.\" What Boll should've done is had Van Damme stare down one of the evil monstrosities, and as he removed a cigar from his mouth he'd say, \"Looks like you'll be alone... IN THE GRAVE!\" Then he'd open fire and blow the demon-spawn back to the brimstone from which it came. The line is cheesy, but it's what is needed if you want to make a bad movie like this work.\n\n\"Some doors are meant to stay shut,\" Slater tells us. Yeah, and some movies are meant to stay unmade. Let's hope it's a lesson that Mr. Boll soon learns.\n\nRating: 1.5 (out of 5)"

Turning popular violent video games into movies is a bad idea and it's guaranteed to result in an unwatchable film. Wasn't the humiliation after that dreadful \"House of the Dead\" enough evidence for him? Obviously not, because here's \"Alone of the Dark\" and he already finished his new potential turkey \"Bloodrayne\". I don't really feel like wasting too many words on this idiotic film, so I'll just second the majority of opinions around here: \"Alone in the Dark\" is a lousy and very irritating film that truly deserves his ranking among the hundred worst movies ever made. The plot (for as far as you can use the term \"plot\") isn't just rubbish, it's also highly unoriginal and d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu! Ancient alternate civilizations....gateways to evil dimensions...secret government agencies that cover up atrocities...kidnapping orphans to experiment upon...It all sounds like a very bad episode from \"the X-files\". The CGI effects are pathetic and the visuals and sound effects are only able to give you a stomach ache. There's absolutely no humor in this film and it's really sad to witness how all the actors take their roles so serious. Talking about acting, this turkey has some of the worst ever! Especially Stephen Dorff should urgently consider a major career change as he only appeared in very mediocre movies lately. Christian Slater looks ludicrous in his role of butt-kicking hero and you can't possibly expect us to see Tara Reid as an intelligent archaeologist, can you? The most alarming fact to me was that I saw this film at a festival were Uwe Boll personally came to present his film. He was talking about this project as he was a new prodigy and the savior of future horror! Painful...very painful."

When doing a horror movie,it seems the most overused ideas to use to spice up the scenes that are supposed to be the scariest is to use the shaky camera when something scary or action oriented is happening or have something constantly jump out from no where and have glass breaking or some other loud noise such as that.\n\nWith the plot holes and terrible writing, I could go on for days about this film, but I'm not.

He's making low budget films for horror fans. I like the Lovecraftian elements the writer has added to the film. He's a writer who's style has been neglected in the past (Most recently a lot of directors have rediscovered his work!).\n\nThe only problems I had with this movie was it could've been a little more cheesier and Francoise Yip should have had a bigger part. The violence is all right and the direction was adequate. We need more R-Rated horror flicks. i wish everybody would quit player hating on Uwe Boll.

Lets face it, the movie didn't break any new ground, but it didn't rehash the current trend of Americanized Japanese movies, or PG rated movies about kids seeing evil spirits that do nothing except attack and then fade to black, leaving the audience asking \"What the heck just happened?\" or \"Did she die?\" Etc.\n\nAnyway, if you're looking for a fun movie, then go for it.

There were way too many minor characters and Tara Reid just shouldn't be allowed to act ever again. Christian Slater did a reasonable job and in reality was the only saving grace of this film. The soundtrack was another killer, especially the very sudden start to the romance scene.\n\nFor me though by far the worst aspect of the film was the directing. For example, in the fight scene at the beginning of the film you can quite clearly see the bad guy's fist punching air just to the side of Christian Slater's face - now I at least know how the actors do that kind of thing! Surely any decent director would have the awareness not to shoot that kind of angle?! I could go on but I think you get the idea that I was not a fan of this film at all. If you enjoy the video game, watching this might put you off playing it ever again so be warned. Go watch something else instead."

The plot holes are ludicrous (the main villain could have ended the entire world some twenty years before the movie even begins, but decided to indulge in an overly complicated plot). The acting lame. The dialog is, by God, outrageous.

It's based on a video game (that I've never played, by the way), so you'd expect there to be lots of flashy and exciting scenes; but there isn't. There are scenes that should be exciting, but it's all so downbeat that it's hard to care. Despite looking good, the film also suffers from really poor production elements, including really bad acting, a terrible script and lethargic direction, courtesy of everyone least favourite modern horror director; the lamentable Uwe Boll.\n\nActually (and thankfully), this is the first film I've seen from Boll, and I'm not finding the idea of the rest being rubbish hard to handle. House of the Dead was lambasted upon release, so you'd expect movie producers to blacklist the director; but instead, they gave him this film, which was also lambasted upon release. So what do they do? They give him Bloodrayne, that gets lambasted and now I've noticed that his upcoming projects include adaptations of Postal and Fear Effect! What's going on here?! I'm not a movie director, and other than what I've picked up through watching other people's films, I don't know anything about movie-making; but I'd really like to think that even I could make a better movie than this one (I'm available to make a video game movie, if any of Boll's producers are listening). This brings me to the acting. I actually rather like Christian Slater, so I really hope that he was well paid for appearing in this trash, because seeing him try to convince the audience that he's all action hero is really painful. No point in mentioning the rest of the cast...or anything else about this film. I wasted an hour and half on it, and it took me about ten minutes writing this. That's enough time down the drain, thanks."

The only one question is: how producers could they produce such a shitty movie? It's not even funny like an old camp. Uwe Boll seems to have ten thousand years of regression in movie making. There's no plot ; no good acting (Stephen Dorf and Christian Slater fight each other for the worst actor award) ; scenes are boring. Especially, don't miss the love scene - it's oddly cut with no reason, so the more little emotion that could have been felt is killed in the egg. Every monster's appearance is a copy-paste of Alien. I rather suggest you to see \"Crocodile\" from Tobe Hooper if you have two hours to spend. At least, it's funny. Sorry for my English. It's not my native language."

And I probably like sci-fi films more than any other, especially if they're amusing with good action and fight scenes - like Serenity, which I saw at the cinema the same day I rented this film on DVD.\n\nSo I was incredibly disappointed that I found this film so hard to enjoy - it could have been so different. It was a mess, like the writers were bored of the idea before they even started. There's a bit of background explained at the start about an ancient race of advanced humans who'd opened a gate to hell or some dark place with demons. See - I don't even know whether it was hell or somewhere else - because I DIDN'T CARE!!!\n\nIt's so important for the viewer to give a damn about the characters in the story, otherwise you lose interest. This was the makers first big mistake. With better writing I might have cared what happened to Christian Slater's character, Edward Carnby, but no!\n\nTheir next big mistake was not bothering to let the story flow properly. From the information about the ancient race to the flashbacks of Carnby's childhood, to the museum pieces and the professor, the connections weren't being made well enough. Since I wasn't paying much attention (due to their first mistake) the story needed to be so easy to follow a 3 year old could make sense of it. Scary monsters and special effects just don't do anything for me if I'm not interested.\n\nThis film will have done nothing for Christian Slater's flagging career. And I've only seen Tara Reid in Scrubs before this, and can't imagine her career will do well out of this. I could blame the director - but the other actors don't come out of this as badly as she does.\n\nI would only recommend this film to someone who needs some time to think and likes to have something going on in the background which isn't going to distract them!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "For a while I'd heard many stories and remarks about Uwe Boll and his merciless take on films adapted from video games. I learned to hate him easily through others and just how his movies appeared from the trailers, etc. but I decided that if I was truly going to comment on him and his work I'd have to sit through one of his flicks. After sitting through Alone in the Dark I have to say that I expected far worse. Plenty has been said about Uwe's talentless take on video game-based movies, but I think there's a lot worse out there than this movie. Sure the story was confusing, the plot badly paced, the acting was obviously substandard, the dialogue was just plain awful, various roles were miscast (I fully agree with masses when it comes to the truly misplaced Tara Reid) and I still believe Uwe's suffering from a massive delusion of grandeur and needs a stiff reality check...but it didn't make my eyes bleed or anything. Visual effects were so-so, MAYBE a little better than I expected, and that's the only thing even remotely close to praise that this movie's going to get from me. I quickly and easily compare it to those laughable straight-to-video/made-for-TV B-movies, it's not going to win any awards (aside from the occasional Razzie) but it just might keep you mildly entertained if you catch it for free somewhere. Try to imagine a step or two or twelve down from Resident Evil (or it's sequel) and you've got this. If you enjoyed Starship Troopers: Hero of the Federation, any of Uwe Boll's films, or any made-for-TV recently (eg. Category 6: Day of Destruction or Category 7: The End of the World) then catch this one, otherwise steer clear or at least proceed with plenty caution."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Alone in the Dark\" (2005), I heard the rumors about this \"movie\" before I watched it for the first time. All I have to say is, this \"film\" isn't as bad as everyone says. It's ten times worse! I'm not joking, this \"movie\" is beyond bad. It's so horrible, that it almost made it onto my top ten worst films of all-time list! \"Alone in the Dark\" has an unbearably boring and laughably predictable story, abysmal acting, boring sets/locations, cheap special effects and a dull soundtrack to attempt to hold this worthless diarrhea stain together. The plot is, a detective who specializes in paranormal activity uncovers mysterious events that could have deadly consequences. No really, that's the whole storyline in a nut shell. Could it be any more vague and minuscule? Look, I'm all for movies with a lack of story, just as long as it has good character development, as well as action and comedy to make up for the lack of plot. A perfect example of a film with very little story, is \"Every Which Way but Loose\" (1978). That movie hardly has any plot. But, the film makers worked hard and put substantial effort into it to make it as entertaining as possible! Plus, a good cast of characters can help make up for a lack of story. Unfortunately, \"Alone in the Dark\" is nothing like that. Fun fact, this \"movie\" is based off a video game, just like the majority of the other films directed by the mistaken for talented Uwe Boll. A lot of his movies are based off of video games, which justifies his lack of creativity. Now granted, I have never played the game that this \"film\" is based off of. But, if this \"movie\" is any indication, then it must be a dull game! Although, it couldn't be that much worse than this \"film\"! Here's a good word to describe how bad this \"movie\" is, shocking. For the majority of the time, nothing happens. Another glaring issue it has, is that most of it is shot very dark and you can hardly see anything! Look, I get that it was supposed to be a horror film. That being said, dark scenes have to be handled with care, or else they turn out to be terrible! Maybe they were just trying to hide the cheap special effects? We'll get to those in a minute. Bottom line, is that it's nothing but a long drawn out monster hunt with this barely established group of characters. It may only be 96 minutes long, but to tell you the truth, you could've fooled me. Seriously, it feels ten times longer than that! As for the acting, it's just as terrible as the story. Nobody in the entire cast even looked like they were trying at all. Not even Christian Slater or Tara Reid could save it, and those two are pretty decent actors! What happened to them here? Those two, along with the rest of the cast, just waddle around like confused morons for the whole duration of the \"movie\" and then it ends. This \"film\" has some of the worst acting I've ever seen! For example, a female character dies and right after the rest of the characters pay their respects and walk away, her head lifts up right before the camera cuts. When I first saw that, I thought to myself: \"what? Did that really just happen?\" I rewound the \"movie\", played it in slow motion and sure enough, she does move her head in the last second of the shot. Did she not go to acting school? All you had to do was lay down and play dead! At the very least, you just have to wait for the director to say, \"cut!\" I'm surprised that the editor didn't catch that. But, we'll go into more details with the editing and special effects in just a moment. Overall, the acting is beyond embarrassing. The sad thing is, we're actually supposed to be taking them seriously! But no, I was just sitting there laughing with how bad their performances were. As far as the sets/locations go, all of them are boring. Like I said, most of it was shot with minimal lighting. Plus, the color filter they used somehow made it look even worse! As far as special effects go, some of them are okay. But, most of them are cheap garbage. Especially the monsters! However that's just scratching the surface. There's a scene where a gun is fired, and the woman is supposed to be hit by the bullet. But, if you look closely, the bullet doesn't hit the character. It doesn't even touch her at all! On top of that, you can clearly tell that the bullet is fake. There are many cheap special effects in this \"film\", but that one is easily the standout. I've seen movies made back in the 1950's with better effects, and this \"film\" was released in 2005! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Reinhard Besser, Oliver Lieb, Bernd Wendlandt and Peter Zweier is nothing short of a cliched mess. Yeah, somehow four people collaborating on the film score couldn't make it sound good. How is that possible?! \"Alone in the Dark\" is easily, one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Just thinking about it is enough to make me sick! Yep, that's how much I hate this waste of cinema. I'm struggling to give this \"movie\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go on IMDB. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. Do I really have to tell you to avoid this \"film\"? No, I think it's more than obvious enough. All it does is take 96 minutes of your time, and leaves you in the dark."

Slater,Reid and Dorff were added bonuses as far as I was concerned.\n\nThis is not the movie that you will forget once out of the cinema or once it's back in the DVD box. But that is not necessarily a good thing. The script is not too bad,the acting is not too bad,the direction id not bad at all and the sound and visual effects are OK enough. The movie lacks emotion,though,and that is its main weakness. No terror,no catharsis,no relief. Not to mention gaps in the script,similarities to other movies of its kind and the most terrible,unimaginative zombies in the history of horror/action flicks.\n\nComparing it with films of its own kind,it lacks. Its main rival would be Resident Evil,another not too brilliant video game-turned-movie attempt. Resident Evil has better effects,better dialogue,better direction,better acting,more horror,more despair for the turn out of things.\n\nSo why did I give it a 4? Well,I know it's not properly adapted from the game series and I know Slater and Dorff will think of it as a black moment in their careers one day but this film did not disappoint me so much. I could easily watch it again (in the not too near future). It's as bad as Alien vs. Predator so I can survive it. Plus,it's cool enough for the 14 year olds! So heck,it could have been worse."

It really was that bad.\n\nThe scenes jumped.\n\nThe acting was stilted. I've seen a six year old give better performances than this! The editing - what can I say? Did the editor not understand how to put a movie together? The producer certainly didn't and the script writer? OMG, what was the issue? Hadn't the script writer graduated from grade school? I've heard better dialogue standing in line waiting for a bus! There was an over the top amount of bad heavy metal music in all the wrong places and the only decent thing I can find to say about this movie is that it did actually come to an end.\n\nThe movie is that bad, don't waste your time. My brain still hurts from trying to puzzle out where the plot was hiding!"

And her terrible acting would be worth it if myself and the rest of the world didn't get to see her \"pizza nipple\" botched implants(she's not even sexy anymore) Alright, the story is fairly disjointed, but fun! Cinematography was pretty well done, and added a dark and creepy atmosphere. Direction was so-so, could've been tightened up a bit. Story left you suspending disbelief quite a bit, but all in all an interesting spin on things. I think the biggest problem is, this movie tries to be sort of a rip-off on Keanu Reeves tortured protagonist character in Constantine. This isn't academy award material but I would recommend it. I just looked up the review for \"Repomen\" starring Jude Law( a REAL stinker) and it scored a 6.3 while this is 2.3?!?!!? The world has gone mad! Anyway, check out this movie, it isn't looking for \"cult horror\" status, but it is entertaining and fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alone in the Dark is the second foray into American released film-making by Uwe Boll and he didn't learn much from his first attempt.\n\nWhile this movie is a tad better than House of the Dead, that is like saying a 47% is better than a 45%. There are both lame and grossly missing something and there are both bad. House of the Dead needed editing or rather get rid of the video game segments. Alone in the Dark needs something else altogether.\n\nIt is not nearly as good as the 1982 movie of the same name or of the 1978 foreign film translated into the same name, but at least it doesn't include snippets of the video game footage (of which there are 5 games to choose from).\n\nRather Alone in the dark needs coherence or adherence to a plot line. There is an idea of a plot.\n\nThat idea being kids are taken and implanted with creature DNA, so that when the alternate world is opened the kids (or now grown-ups) will come to the will of a mad scientist. Only the scientist infects himself, the will succumbs to the creatures, the creatures are locked in a cave that is bobby-trapped by creatures, but wait the alternate universe isn't opened yet. Or at least that is what I think the plot is, with the addition of some artifacts need to be used to open the cave and the main characters get those artifacts because the mad scientist works for the good guys.\n\nBasically the cave looks cool, but why not just see the movie The Cave which looks just as good. the creatures look neat, but again see The Cave or a majority of other creature features. Stephen Dorff does a good job, but his part is woefully short and ends up relying on do much gun fire and quick cuts. Slater's role may make Mindhunters seem Oscar worthy and Ms. Reid s just supposed to look pretty. In terms of eye candy she does fine, but here dramatic features are wanting and acting from anybody else is pretty non-discreet.\n\nIn all, very little Dorff, to much stilted acting, to many quick cuts, to much gun fire, a convoluted plot, and some non-censorial Alternate reality stuff.\n\nAt least Alone in the Dark makes one forget why Darkness and Elecktra were bad, but that is still not a saving grace."

        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing previews for this film, I was kind of excited about it because it looked like it would be a cheesy fun \"Aliens\" rip-off with Christian Slater. I was right about one thing, it does have Christian Slater. I first saw this when it came out on DVD. My friends and I got dead drunk over its laborious 90 minutes and then went to see \"Batman Begins\" to wash it out of our brains. Among other things, this film was my first Uwe Boll movie. I'd heard people calling him the worst director ever after \"House of the Dead\" came out. I had to see for myself and this film seemed like the perfect opportunity. I actually did go back and saw it sober just so I could know I was judging it fairly and so I could listen to Boll's commentary. This review is based on the sober viewing.\n\nI never played the game this film is based on, but I think I have a pretty good idea of what's going on here. The opening title crawl explains to us (and a test audience who didn't figure it out) that a Native American civilization called The Abkani once existed, but stopped existing after opening the gateway between worlds (Lovecraft anyone?). It also talks about a government agency that researched the Abkani and their monsters and the mad scientist who headed up the project. Once that crap is over with, we meet Christian Slater as video game character Edward Carnby who has just arrived in a location that is really Canada in disguise and some guy is already trying to kill him. They fight in the most obvious movie street ever before Carnby puts a CG bullet in the guy. From here we meet Tara Reid as a \"genius\" anthropologist (read: requisite \"babe scientist\") who is in a museum doing some kind of expo on the Abkani (remember them from the prologue?). Monsters you can't quite see show up and Carnby has flashbacks of being an orphan child experimented on by the mad scientist. Oh, and Stephen Dorff shows up as an X-Files soldier type guy who Slater used to work with.\n\nCome to think of it, the movie was never too clear on any of these things. I like ambiguity as much as the next movie nerd, but it's not like the dialog or characters make up for it. Reid is an object (and if you hear the commentary, Boll pretty much thought of her as that \"she is not losing her bra!\"), Slater the stoic action detective with a past but very few lines, and Dorff grunts at Slater a lot. Why did they ever bother getting name stars if they weren't going to give them anything to do? The murky little plot boils down to this: Slater and mankind vs. mad scientist and monsters.\n\nThe big question is: does this result in a scary film? This is technically part of the horror genre (it really fails to develop any real elements of action, sci-fi, or spy/detective genres). The title \"Alone in the Dark\" suggests that this could really be some scary s***. However, for most of this film, the characters are not alone, and it never really gets that dark. Even the scenes in the mine towards the end of the film are brightly lit as if this were a comedy. Sure, there are monsters, and \"sleeper\" zombie-like people, and the world is supposedly threatened, but none of that is frightening.\n\nIn the end, the best parts of \"Alone in the Dark\" are the art on the DVD case and Boll's commentary in which he blames the box-office failure of this film on American audiences being \"afraid\" of movies as \"different\" as his. I won't blow the ending, but Boll called it a \"daring\" \"David Lynch ending\" (which has to be the biggest insult David Lynch has ever received). Boll explains how the German tax-shelter allows him to make endless bombs and rather than actually trying to defend his inept direction, he simply blames his detractors (including IMDb commenters) for his reputation. No, Uwe, you dug this hole all by yourself.\n\nIn short, it was better with the beer, but not by much."

And could someone please explain to me how this man has a consistent source of cash and some sort of tax shelter. I did the math from his films (this one, Bloodrayne, house of the dead, and in the name of the king) and he has lost at least 40 million dollars. In short he's costing everyone money.

        "review_detailed_main": "Uwe Boll's name is synonymous with the words \"hack\", \"moron\", \"incompetent director\", \"horrible,\" the list goes on and on. His American theatrical movies have been this, and House of the Dead, another video game based movie. House of the Dead was universally panned, so naturally, this was too. But I have to admit, Uwe Boll's movies are a pile of garbage that smells and tastes like deep fried chicken: It's garbage, but it's good at the same time.\n\nAlone in the Dark stars Christian Slater as Edward Carnby, a guy who's a paranormal investigator. His girlfriend is played by Tara Reid, and get this....wait, wait for it....she's an archaeologist. I mean, already anybody who reads that Tara was cast as an archaeologist has to give the director some credit for making such a weird, crazy casting decision. But, from what I could decipher from it's odd nonsensical plot, they both have to like....I don't even really know what they have to do. I do know that they have a key that opens something evil, there's a bullet-proof monster that attacks in the dark, there's a huge division of paranormal investigators (I didn't know they had those in real life!), and a crazy old guy who wants to, yes, you guessed it, conquer the world with these monsters. Sounds weird, doesn't it? Yes, it is....and it makes for one stupid, hilarious, entertaining movie.\n\nGetting into the acting for Alone in the Dark would be the same as trying to explain why a fish would die if it were taken out of water: Completely pointless, because we all know what happens. So, the acting is horrible. But it's so horrible, it's hilarious. The only movie I remember Christian Slater being in, at least one that I've seen, is Broken Arrow. That movie was pretty cool, and I didn't care for the acting. He doesn't do a bad job with the material he's given in here, but Tara Reid as an archaeologist\u0085.now that's something to see. She looks so out of place as her character, and she looks like she has no idea what she's talking about, and that just makes the movie so much better and so much funnier. Stephen Dorff has done some good acting jobs in the past: Deuces Wild was pretty cool, Blade was the most awesome movie ever made, but Cold Creek Manor, like Alone in the Dark, was funny and horrible, but somehow good because of that. But whatever. In here, he plays an agent and ex-friend of Carnby, and at one point in the movie (near the end), Dorff's character learns something that makes him angry. So, in one of the funniest parts of the movie, Dorff gets angry, yells, and kicks over a table. I quietly laughed. I'm not sure if it was because it was so laughably ridiculous, or because it was too intense for my feeble mind to comprehend. I'm gonna go with the latter.\n\nNow, I've basically been bashing the movie, so I'm guessing, you, the reader, are probably asking the computer screen, \"Dude, why did you give it an 8 if you're bashing it?\" I'll tell you why: The movie has one cool scene where the agents are shooting the monster in the dark, and the room is lit up by all the gun flashes or whatever, and you could see the monster for just a split second. Now, this scene is cool, but the rock music they play during it is what I'm not too fond of. It's some weird song I've never heard of, so naturally, I'm thinking, \"This scene would be cool if there was some Gwar music in the background.\" But it's forgiven. The scene was cool and entertaining. The other action scenes are entertaining as well, but really, it's a team effort in a sense. The action scenes combined with the movie's horridness really make it a true piece of entertainment.\n\nThis movie is entertaining, just because it's so bad and funny. I enjoyed House of the Dead, but House of the Dead had something that this movie really didn't: More gratuitous nudity, and more blood. Alone has some blood, but not much, but sadly, it has no gratuitous nudity, so I have to take a point or two away.\n\nI can't wait for Uwe's next movie, Bloodrayne. I hope this guy keeps making movies, because they just keep getting stupider and stupider, and more entertaining. Plus, seeing how mad people get over these movies is absolutely priceless. His movies are entertaining, but Alone in the Dark was missing just a few things: Gratuitous nudity, blood and gore, and some Gwar tunes, and for missing those, I have to deduct a few points. In Bloodrayne, it's already said that there's lesbians and nudity in it, and naturally, there's gonna be blood. Hopefully in that movie, they put in some Gwar tracks. But until then, I can only hope...\n\nScore: 8 out of 10! No joke!"

The film is quite basic and its relationship with video games (as I read) is almost nil since it only takes the title, the characters and some situations. In addition, this is a film that is more action-oriented and is considered more of a thriller. It has a few bugs (which I've never noticed before) and some unnecessary cuts in the final cut that make it hard to understand since the director's cut is a bit more consistent and easier to keep up with. Christian Slater is the highlight, as for Tara Reid, I don't know why they say that she acts badly if I saw her acting quite normal. The digital effects are simple, but the Xenos are pretty cool. The movie is more of a B-movie and it is unlikely that it was released in theaters, but it was according to certain sources. Alone In The Dark in the end is not the worst movie of all time as many paint it because it is just another mediocre film of the bunch that only serves to entertain and that's all. My rating for this film is 6/10, but only for the final cut since I give the director's cut a 7/10."

And the over curious cab driver, \"Tell me what you do...because that's the best part of the job.\" (The best part of the job is filling in back story?).

Christian's comments in the \"making of the movie\" featurette made me sad...\n\nthe story is silly, but it's not really as hard to follow as some would have you believe... it is derivative and threadbare (but how many aren't in this genre?)... the creatures do look like bad lifts from many monster flicks of yore... in fact at times i had deja vu, like i was seeing the relic again (the marines dropping into the museum, etc etc)... but hey, some of those movies are only a few points better than this...\n\ni think my biggest problem is that i can discern no connection to the games... unless the 4th game is a little different?... carnby has too many friends and helpers... the biggest sin is he is not truly alone in the dark...\n\nalthough i sort of stood up for this, it really is a very bad film... it's reasonably short (probably the best thing about it) but it's not as boring as say, ghost of mars... rent this only if you're curious, or you really want to watch a guns and monsters movie that requires no mental participation on your part..."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off let me say that in no way do I hate Uwe Boll like most people on this site. Why do you ask? Because this is the first movie of his I've seen. Of course if I see another one this bad I'll probably change my mind. The acting is horrendous as is the logic of the characters. The visual effects if you want to call them that also leave something to be desired.\n\nWhile Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff are normally decent actors, in this movie they are just bad. So is Tara Reid but that is to be expected by now. The movie is boring and uninspired. Well I guess I shouldn't really say that as some of the scenes were definitely \"inspired\" or I guess you could say ripped off from \"Aliens.\" They have the same motion tracker, the aliens in this have the tongue penetrating thing and many other things I'm sure you'll notice along the way. Movies like \"Starship Troopers\" and \"Hellboy\" are also borrowed in smaller doses.\n\nNow I'll let you in on the good stuff. All 3 things that you might want to skip to on the DVD if you can get to see it for free. 1) Very cool gore scene when one of the soldier's arms is torn off by an alien., 2) Very cool gore scene when some female soldier's head is split down the middle. Pretty sick looking. and 3) This one is my favorite, so watch this scene. When Stephen Dorff says that one of the female soldiers is dead, she starts moving before the camera even stops showing her. Very funny stuff.\n\nOverall, it sucked. 4/10"

Well, after seeing the rating and looking at some of the reviews online, I was really excited to see simply how awfully horrible this movie was. I bought the movie, sat down and watched it with my friend.\n\nTo start off, I'm very disappointed at the film. Why? well..because it's not THAT bad. I guess I was expecting a demonic piece of work which made me bleed out of my ears and leave me in a permanent coma. However, Alone in The Dark is nothing but a failed attempt in creating a crappy B movie flick.\n\nHaving said that the movie isn't that bad, I think I understand why many people think so negatively of this movie. Naturally you think of the conversion of the game Alone in the Dark into a movie and you know its going to be a disaster. Most people who are not fans of the game are expecting a bad, but laughable movie, and what they got was a bad and tedious movie. Seriously, this film is hard to watch. It's easier to watch 2001, Apocalypse Now and Schindler's List ALL IN A ROW than to watch this...thing.\n\nSo to all those who are curious about alone in the dark, here is the thing, it's simply a short yet tedious bad yet not funny \"c\" movie which obtained a terrible reputation by the all-of-a-sudden fan group of the video game..nothing else.\n\nUwe Boll doesn't need to go to hell for this, he just needs to learn from his mistakes or simply take a holiday, a long holiday.\n\n3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ed Wood be proud, so many years later his successor has finally arrived in Uwe Boll. The incompetent director of the laugh-fest House of the Dead. Now in his sophomore effort he's been able to succeed at the unthinkable make a good movie? no make one even worse than that soon to be oh my god I can't believe how bad this is Camp classic House of the Dead. It's quite obvious to me now almost anyone can write a script and be funded in the industry and you will too after not seeing but witnessing the unintentional laugh-fest Alone in the Dark. Now for the film's story Christian Slater stars in the worst comeback role ever as Edward Carnby a paranormal investigator whom I think was let go from the big paranormal investigation division and is now freelance or working for himself or something. In the opening scene after the horrific and plot outlining prologue Slater battles a superhuman who jumps off bridge and through windows attacking him from above. The person whom is powered by the dark forces wants to get a key he's holding, for no particular reason they fight in overly used matrix style combat moves. Tara Reid stars as the the films supporting mess as the asst curator at a museum doing a display of the ancient American Indian tribe the fictional Abkani's whom were mysteriously wiped off the face of the earth. She teeters along unbelievably and delivers the ultra bad dialog even more horrifically than it's initially written. Stephen Dorff stars as the leader of the paranormal military division sent to fight and take out the creatures whom they are being attacked by. a one emotion bad ass gur whom has an assorted supposed history th the film's characters. And the rest is all yada yada yada as the film moves along at an unitentionally laughable and exquisitely bad pace. The film has so many flaws it's hard to name them all but lets give it a try first with the one thing that bothered me the most. The film quality was absolutely atrocious it felt like I was watching a horribly unfinished rough cut of the actual film. It was grainy and mostly unsee-able accompanying the farce was a hilariously placed soundtrack and score and some of the worst dialog I've ever heard from any movie in my entire life. But the real treasure here is Miss Reid she is one hell of a flake and delivers the most memorably awe inspiring bad performance ever, truly one that will be quoted in porn films and frat parties in the future. Some of the things the film has going for it are some mediocre fx and some nice asst. directed camera effects. maybe Boll should put in sometime as an asst director first. But here it is people I'm not gonna tell you not to rush in too see this. The film is damn great entertainment definitely one of the most hilarious films I've seen in years. At the screening i witnessed there was a dreadful trailer for his next project Bloodrayne. Love it, or hate it and you'll probably hate it Alone makes a nice addition into this troubled film makers career had I known we could be drunk while filming a movie, I'm sure much more more of us would have embarked on the journey earlier on in life. Filled with inexplicably bad scenarios and unintentional laugh inducing moments Alone is in the top of it's class so bad it's good. and I can't wait for the next one."

ALL oft he cast is believable, and the monsters? SCARY. They literally scared me so much that I screamed! The film has underlying themes and moral issues are addressed. How to deal with racism, sex before marriage, the military. All of that, and this film pulls it off quite nicely.\n\nUwe boll is probably my favorite director next to the Wayans Bros. His movies scare you, sadden you, bring joy, and ask you to examine your beliefs. Buy this movie today, and you won't be left in the dark."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just came back from a matin\u00e9e of this. I didn't pay too close attention to the plot because I was still high from the joint I smoked not too long before the show. However when watching a movie like this plot tends to get in the way. The only thing you need to know going into this is that creepy killer monsters and zombies are bad, and the characters must KILL THEM ALL WITH BIG GUNS! As a brainless sci-fi actioner, Alone in the Dark reminds me of a second rate Aliens. Black Creepy monsters, Swat Teams, and (in what I believe is a direct homage) Auto-Turrets.\n\nChristian Slater and Stephen Dorrf are both in their elements. The only REALLY terrible thing is.... Tara Reid. While Miss Reid may be entertaining in teen comedies as the dumb, but hot, blonde chick. In AitD she is cast as an assistant curator of a museum, and yet she delivered her lines like a dumb, but hot, blonde chick. The fact that this film doesn't have a strong female lead hurts it greatly. Tia Carrere would have been perfect in this role as she proved her archaeological chops in her series 'Relic Hunter.' This films strengths are its action and effects shots, accompanied by the ever prevalent heavy metal music that is in nearly every action movie to come out in the past few years. I have read hundreds of reviews of these films written by old men who pine for the days of old, when movies were accompanied by great scores performed by orchestras. Metal is here to stay in the action genre and the sooner everyone accepts that, the sooner they can learn to appreciate it for the musical merits it holds.\n\nOverall, this is a good film. Especially if you don't pay attention to little details and enjoy the carnage about to ensue."

Well, to put it gently, most of the audience I saw it with viewed it as a comedy and were cheering by the time the ending credits came up. Whether or not this is a good thing is up to you. Just consider what the film is supposed to be.\n\nNot having seen \"House of the Dead\", I don't have a true frame of reference as to how good or bad this film could be, but I can say that I have seen worse (Elektra, Catwoman, and Batman & Robin come to mind)."

There's no need for me to list all the shortcomings of this film, just read the other reviews here, all the ugly things said are not exaggerated. Sometimes I see a movie that got awful reviews and still find something in it that makes me think 'it's not that bad', but \"Alone In The Dark\" has no such redeeming features. It's simply the worst movie ever. What surprised me most is that this movie looks like it had quite a budget. Normally you would expect a movie that has this sort of high tech special effects to have at least a hint of a storyline, but this looks like someone cut random action scenes from completely different movies together to 96 minutes of film. Somewhere in the mess is a pivotal scene when a frightened Christian Slater looks into the camera and screams \"What the hell is going on here?\". I so knew how he felt. Was this movie sabotaged by a disgruntled cutter? Was there a script involved in the making of this? Why did not one of the executives take Uwe Boll to the side and remind him that it would be helpful if some scenes in this movie had at least something to do with the next. And than there is Tara Reid. Nothing spells quality entertainment like the lights going off in the cinema, you watch the screen and the name 'Tara Reid' appears in the opening titles. Before I saw this movie I thought the idea of casting Tara Reid as a super intelligent anthropologist is quite funny, you know, like it would be to cast Paris Hilton as the world's leading brain surgeon. However, now that I've seen it I think that there was no irony intended in this casting whatsoever. Poor Tara tries to play this role straight and to call her performance unconvincing would be the understatement of the century. The movie ends with Tara and Christian wandering through a deserted city, I still have no idea why this city was deserted, but I sure do know why every theater that this movie played in was..."

The dialogue by the actors was good at times & pathetic at times (especially Tara Reid's), & the special effects ( especially the bullet going through the block of ice) was amazing. The idea of a portal to another world of evil monsters, and government conspiracies is not original, but I thought the film came out pretty nice, especially with a halo of bullets flying everywhere."

        "review_detailed_main": "The title of this film is very misleading, since I can't think of a single scene where someone is alone in the dark, save for one brief scene in the museum. Now, this is the part where I would summarize the story of the film, but this is rather difficult, since it was mostly non-existent and incoherent. I will try my best. Paranormal detective Edward Carnby(Slater) is a man with a troubled past. It seems he was an orphan selected to be a part of a genetic experiment involving creatures from another world, but escaped before the scientists got to him. He spent his life being afraid of the dark and looking for things that go bump in the night. He is then chased by some goon and fights him, and then uncovers the mystery behind the monsters that thrive in the dark. This is done of course with the help of his ex, a paleontologist(Reid) and an FBI agent(Dorf). It could have been a stylish, atmospheric horror film, but instead it turned itself into an action flick. The violence seems to take over the plot. The director cared more for the action than the story. Much more time was needed for all of the characters, yet they seem to be just breezed through in between shoot outs with the monsters. The only reason I gave this film a four was because of Slater's and Dorff's performances, and because the action sequences were done relatively well. Alone in the Dark is a standard shoot the monsters B-movie with little in terms of suspense and plot, and contains Pervasive Strong Violence, Language, and a Brief Sex Scene."

I would rather have they make this one over, and place the setting in the start or middle of the 20th century, in the mansion where it all takes place in the game, so that the movie for a twist actually might become true towards its original source.\n\nOtherwise Toybox made fine effects. The SFX were OK, but the soundtracks were really bad. Only great part musically is at the end of the movie. So you'll be looking forward to the end of the movie. Can't tell which band it is, or I would be spoiling the greatest part in the movie... or should I say after the movie!"

But, I was wrong., it's totally difference. Tara Reid(Aline Cedrac) again plays in another suck movie (except Guess Who). The movie is very lack in story, cinematography, and effects. According to me, Alone in The Dark(AID) is no more than a C-class movie. I was really disappointed to watch this movie as I watched Resident Evil movies. But, this is worst. Resident Evil(RE) is better than this one. RE is an action movie and AID is a twilight zone movie. Hahaha, I'm kinda confusing to guess what is its genre. Entirety, this movie is pretty bad as a Hollywood movie. And I deserve to give rating 4/10 for this one. Do You Agree?"

Then, shadow monsters start showing up, there's something about a magical artifact that opens that dimensional gateway thing, and after stumbling through the most half-assed exposition I've ever seen in my life, stretched out over half the movie, the cast assembles to descend into an old mineshaft and \"discover\" this secret laboratory, with the dimensional gateway hidden behind a medicine cabinet. There's a big explosion, and the end of the movie has the two main characters in an evacuated city standing around like idiots.\n\nFrom start to finish this is an unsatisfying, unmoving, shallow, clich\u00e9', illogical, unappealing, and totally worthless film.

But couple of hours before, I was not happy seeing a movie that was poorly written and had bad leading actor and actress.\n\nThe story is about an ancient North American Indian tribe who was very advanced but simply disappeared after opening some sort of doorway to another dimension of sorts. The doorway was closed but not before some terrible things came over and supposedly killed many of them. Fast forward to present time and you have a zealot professor who wants to get all the relics of this ancient race for his own personal reason. Also, you have a secretive paranormal US government agency whose job is to track this type of activity.\n\nChristian Slater portrays a former agent from this paranormal agency whose mission is to find out why he has no recollection after 10 years old. And you have Tara Reid, who plays an assistant curator of a museum, working for the diabolical professor, and who is a love interest of Christian Slater character.\n\nLet me first start off by saying Tara Reid is a bad actress. I have no ill will towards this woman but she really cannot act. The only thing I liked her was in Van Wilder and she palatable because the story was so damn funny. Here, she has no choice but to really act and you could see she has no acting ability.\n\nAs for Christian Slater, what can you say except he should have stopped acting after early 1990's and used whatever money he had by going into some business because his sneer-like demeanor really is annoying. This guy is also someone who is one dimensional and has no real acting range. He has that one dimensional personality that I remember seeing in the movie \"Heathers.\" In fact, that same demeanor is in all his movies.\n\nOverall a bad experience. I just got up and left the movie theater about 60% into the movie. I could not stand to watch this awful movie any further. I would rather go home and see the paint chip away from my walls."

A low score of 2.3 (on February 20th, 2016) is nothing to be proud of, for sure. I wonder if people are just disliking it because it is an Uwe Boll movie.\n\nI did enjoy the movie for what it was: brainless entertainment that ran for about an hour and a half. I must admit that I had expected more in terms of horror and a dark setting for the movie, given the fact that it is based on the \"Alone in the Dark\" games. But director Uwe Boll decided to take the movie in a more action-based way, essentially turning it into nothing more than an \"Aliens\" rip-off in a way.\n\nThe story is about Edward Carnby (played by Christian Slater) who is troubled by nightmares and having problems with remembering his childhood which was spent at an orphanage. Ancient Abskani artifacts are unearthed and opened, bringing darkness and creatures that dwell in the darkness with it.\n\nRight, well the story was a no-brainer, for sure. But still, it proved to be entertaining enough, if you take it for what it was. And as such, then I found entertainment in \"Alone in the Dark\". Slightly less than mediocre entertainment, mind you.\n\nThe cast was alright, and Christian Slater did pull the biggest load of the movie all by himself. Stephen Dorff seemed to be running on autopilot throughout the course of the movie.\n\nAs for the special effects and CGI, well I will say that it was adequate and served its purposes well enough. Just don't expect to be blown away by a myriad of overly impressive sights and spectacles.\n\nIt was a shame that the director took \"Alone in the Dark\" into an all-action direction, because \"Alone in the Dark\" should be kept in the dark, brooding and bleak universe of scares and survival horror that it is in the games.\n\n\"Alone in the Dark\" is not amongst the best of movies from director Uwe Boll, whom has a bunch of movie version of games to his name already."

There are many movies that you can watch if you want a good supernatural action movie, which goes against the very theme of the games! The games are survival horror, and this gives no real suspense like it should. Uwe Boll doesn't even check himself for continuity errors. Trash like this should never have been allowed in theatres, even if it was only for two weeks. Don't watch it. If you do watch it, remember to make sure you remember, it's not based on the game.

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, everyone has pretty much lambasted this movie by now. Therefore I will make an effort to say something positive. Personally I felt Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff, two capable and arguably underrated stars, did as well as they could with what they were given to work with here. Slater somehow actually manages to remain likable throughout this whole thing and I don't think that was a small feat in this instance. That's about the only thing positive I can say about this film.\n\nOf course, it's rarely the case that a movie based on a video game is any good and this is certainly no exception to that rule. Uwe Boll starts the movie basically where the middle should have been. It's like playing a video game and suddenly finding yourself trust deep within the game play with little or no explanation as to what is going on. Sure we do get the scrolling text at the beginning of the movie. The problem with that is instead of telling us, we should have been shown. The OMEGA MAN style ending also shows some potential and actually proves much more interesting than most of the rest of this movie. If a story had started from there, it might have provided better results although I doubt it somehow given Boll's involvement (although I do keep expecting him to prove me wrong one of these days with some competent B-Movies).\n\nThe special effects are particularly disappointing too as never do we get the sense that the monsters we see here are anything but CGI critters. They definitely lack realism and that really hurts when the success of your film is basically dependent on them to provide your horror film with its overall punch. Actually the previously mentioned OMEGA MAN does a much better job of creating terrifying adversaries for a lone hero to fight and that was achieved via make-up work and fine acting talent. Don't even get me started on how truly awful Tara Reid is in this one.\n\nSimply put, a mindless waste of time. An action horror film that lacks suspense, realism and is largely a confused, muddled mess. Still the B-Movie, and the so bad it's almost good movie fan in me doesn't totally dislike this one."

The idea of a parasite attaching itself to the spinal column and manipulating the nervous system sounds an awful lot like the Puppet Masters. The mad scientist doing experiments on humans has been used too much. Tara Reid should never be cast in ANYTHING. SHE CAN'T ACT! The special effects were OK. I give them a 4 out of 10 stars.\n\nOn the plus side, I thought the Abkani civilization was a great idea. Even though I am not a Christian Slater fan, I believe he fit the part well. The movie had great action sequences and kept you wondering what would happen next. Stephen Dorff was quite convincing as a power tripping, self absorbed son of a _______.\n\nSit back and watch the movie as if you have never heard of the game.

The only redeeming part of this movie was the relatively decent CGI work done on the critters, and even then, it was so dark when you COULD see them that they there were probably less than 5 seconds of decent footage of them.

It is slow, poorly acted, worse than any made for TV movies I've ever seen. The creature effects simply make me sad because there were obviously some talented artists working on this poop. I feel that a film like this just wasted a whole lot of time for every one who touched it. Actors, technicians, designers, camera people, caterers... just consider that team of people who had to build that really scary monster and make it jump around and kill those people no one cares for. When the story is this bad... it's as though someone is spraying all their hard work with diarrhea.\n\nI believe someone decided to make this movie terrible on purpose. Starship Troopers meets The X-Files put in a blender with yes.. extra poo. Perhaps a producer decided that he hated a small or large group of people (also audiences in general) and that the best way to punish them was to make this movie and put all their enemies in it. Christian Slater should not be in movies this bad.

It's fragmented and disjointed, with scenes that have little to do with each other, horribly transposed upon each other, with little transition. It's full of generic and 'mandatory' scenes that do little to further the plot. Like the Slater/Reid sex scene - its only purpose in the film was to show off Tara Reid in a bra, and frankly I can get that online in 30 seconds, I don't need to waste an hour forty-five for a thirty second, ridiculously out-of-place,on-screen roll in the hay. And there are a couple of moments of gore, which belong in Dawn of the Dead, not an Aliens-clone sci-fi action film.\n\nFrankly, this film wouldn't even make a good video game - it doesn't hold a candle to the Playstation game it's based on. It's too hackneyed; a string of second-rate action sequences held together by grand canyon-sized plot holes and some of the worst dialogue I've ever encountered. Not to mention heavy over-emoting by the good IL' evil doctor villain character, and the bad-ass military character, the latter played by Stephen Dorff, who suddenly goes from irritating power-hungry jerk-off to heroic military buddy.\n\nAnd I haven't even touched on the lack of character background, lack of chemistry, or the shallow attempts to use strobes and lots of machine gun fire to hide the lack of CGI effects. Guess the budget just wasn't high enough. Do yourself a favour, just rent Aliens instead.\n\n1.5/10 - and only because, sadly enough, I've actually seen one or two films that are worse."

        "review_detailed_main": "Title:Alone in the Dark\n\nDirector: Uwe Boll\n\nCast: Christian Slater, Stephen Dorf, Tara Reid\n\nReview:\n\nUwe Boll is up to his tricks again...has he gotten better at the game of making of movies? Or does he still like to destroy franchises like he did with House of the Dead? Well...a little bit of both me thinks.\n\nThe story is about this paranormal detective called Edward Carnby (Slater) who is hot on the trail of some ancient artifacts from a disappeared civilization. At the same time an organization called the 713 (think an X-files with machine guns and a small army) is investigating some creatures that have been turning up killing people. The 713 decide its time to kick the creatures butts and therein lies our movie. Carnby used to belong to the 713 and decides to tag along with them and figure out a part of his past that is missing.\n\nAs for the movie, Ill be honest, House of the Dead is left a few steps behind.This is in fact a superior film, but when you think about it, topping HOTD isn't really all that hard. Lets see, I liked the fact that the CGI was held in control, there's no over abundant use of cgi, its used at just the right moments. Also, it does some character development, the main character actually has a past and a story so you get to know him a bit before the action gets rolling. And then the story is actually interesting.\n\nAs I watched the movie I felt that Boll was holding back on his fast editing techniques and hacking and slashing scenes...he was refraining himself from going ballistic to the point of not making any sense like it happened in HOTD. But when the shoot-out at Christian Slaters apartment starts to happen I completely lost it and burst out laughing cause it was like Boll just cut loose and let out all his fast action, fast editing, -what the hell is going on here- techniques loose and just went Crrrrrazy! The movie still has some things that bring it down a bit like for example...the story was waaay to simple and they fill it up with a lot of filler back story. Yet, amongst all the filler story, they don't manage to explain the origin of the creatures. What the hell where those creatures....I don't know cause either it wasn't explained at all...or they explained it so poorly that I didn't even get it. And then there's this totally unnecessary sex scene that was so devoid of emotion! I simply couldn't understand why it was there! It served no purpose whatsoever in the story. My point is, if your going to have a gratuitous sex scene at least make it worth our while! Alas..there were no Tara Reid boobies to be seen anywhere.\n\nSlater, Dorff and Reid are trying their best to look like they give a crap about whats happening in the movie...and in certain instances they try a little over acting to spice things up. There's on totally hilarious scene with Dorf going all angry cause he finds something out. Tara Reid stood out as a one note performance on this one. Slater and Reed look like a couple of has beens trying to survive making cheap horror movies. But heck I guess given the type of film that they were making they did alright.\n\nWhat we have here my friends is an enjoyably, cheesy step up from the mess that House of the Dead was. Its not a masterpiece of course, but I have seen many many worse horror films.\n\nMy advice? Wait for it on video.\n\nRating: 2 out of 5"

I actually think this is the worst film I have ever seen, and I have seen some awful films. I am not going to give an in-depth description of the film because that has already been done here. Plus, I wouldn't be able to simply because I couldn't stomach to watch the whole film.\n\nThe film had the most confusing plot ever. From the very beginning it made no sense. I had no clue what was happening and why. Also, I feel bad for Christian Slater. He has always been a capable actor, he just picked a really bad movie to be in. Tara Reid is such a terrible actor I have no idea how she gets cast in anything. She was embarrassingly bad in this. It actually made me uncomfortable watching her. She is expressionless and dull. Name any other female actor, they would have done a better job in this. I actually think I will avoid seeing any movie with her in it in the future. Anyway, my advice is to never see this movie. It will be a total waste of your money and time."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a film \"Alone in the Dark\" stands as a sort of half-way point between Uwe Boll's House of the Dead and BloodRayne. Like BloodRayne it has a fairly competent production but like House of the Dead suffers from a lack of serious credibility.\n\nFirst the good points, the opening half was actually fairly entertaining and though I question the usage of an opening text-drag as a means of exposition it undoubtedly has a kind of old-school video-game call back feel to it. The action scenes during the first half were also good and the actors emote with a degree of sincerity. Also I thought the soundtrack was great all through the film. Also the CGI work was actually pretty good.\n\nHowever in the latter half the film starts going down hill in a big way. During its more epic moments it starts to lose the warmth of the first half and turns into a rather dull and serious escapade which lacks any sort of emotion. The gunfights are nearly incomprehensible and the later left-fielder moments fail to impress the same way they did in the first half. The big problem with this film is that after a promising start it fails to build up to anything significant or even entertaining. We also get a lot of redundant shots of the 713 guys gearing up for battle as well as another quite embarrassing sex-scene which Boll seems to be very fond of.\n\nAlone in the Dark feels like something that could have had a lot of promise but its complete lack of comical entertainment value, compared to that of House of the Dead, makes it a movie that just feels drained of all content by the end."

I'm one of those guys that goes out and rents crappy movies on purpose. So I've probably seen more than my fair of Bad Movies.\n\nAll that said, I was expecting \"AITD\" to not turn out very well. I even invited some friends to a theater that doesn't enforce a 'no talking during the film' rule, so that we could have our way with the film, as I assume everyone else was there to do. And, boy, did it not turn out well.\n\nBoll's \"Alone In The Dark\" rates at a solid #4 on my \"Worst Movies EVER\" list. I didn't think any major release would be able to out-suck \"Battlefield Earth\" this soon, but you've proved me wrong, Mr. Boll. Thank you for your badly shot, edited with a chainsaw, 90 minute ode to Shooting At Things In Slow Motion In The Dark Set To Bad House Music, that's 1/16th of my day that I'll never get back. And I'm sure Travolta's sleeping a little easier these days..."

Tara Reid tries to act intelligent in this movie, but you can only imagine how many takes it took her to pronounce the word \"archeologist.\" The \"action\" sequences are impossible to analyze, basically amounting to chopped together scenes of people firing guns. Some \"bullet-time\" have been so overplayed that you almost can't wait for it to be over. Its worth watching on video to maybe laugh at, or if the video game gives you wet dreams."

I read some of the reviews before and I expected a very disastrous movie, but in fact, I must honestly say that it was not worse than Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Sure, the acting could be better and the characters do not develop at all, but still, some of the action effects are not bad and it's definitely not a movie you would like to find in the Bottom Top 100.\n\nGranted, it's not a good movie. Nothing you want to see more than once. Nothing you want to pay money for. Still, there's a story, a rather good soundtrack which does its job, and most honestly, the camera is pretty awesome.\n\nI give this one a 5/10. It's not a good flick, but definitely not as disastrous as some anti-Boll people pretend it to be."

Poke my eyes out with hot needles.\n\nChristian Slater's career committed suicide wtih this garbage. Tara Reid will be fine only because she is hot. Uwe Boll deserves to rot after this mess.

        "review_detailed_main": "Anyone who has had the pleasure of watching the 2003 \"horror film\" House of the Dead knows the name Uwe Boll is synonymous with fear. Fear of being stuck in a dark movie theatre with no way out while one of the films he has directed is playing. The new \"horror film\" Alone in the Dark continues this lovely tradition. Easily the worst film of the year, (a spot that likely won't change much in the next twelve months) this is the perfect date movie for a couple wanting to break-up.\n\nThe story has something to do with an ancient culture and evil spirits and giant lizards and the world ending and a whole bunch of stuff that makes about as much sense as Tara Reid playing an anthropologist. Actually, it's a little surprising that Paris Hilton didn't pop-in to play a genius statistician. The incredibly dark cinematography doesn't help much, either. Creating terror takes a bit more talent than simply turning down the lights. Of course, Dr. Boll (apparently he has a doctorate in literature\u0085 somehow) doesn't quite understand the finer details of film-making such as pacing, mood, structure, cohesion and, best of all, quality.\n\nThe most heart-breaking fact of all is that every year tons and tons of good films come out but get no distribution and end up lost in a vicious marketplace while a \"film\" such as Alone in the Dark gets a wide release in over 2000 theatres. Adding to this pain is the notion that our dear friend Dr. Boll has three films coming out in the next two years, all based on videogames just as House of the Dead and this \"film\" have been. Indeed, the horror\u0085 the horror"

Standing in Carnby's way, however, is the impact that a brief encounter with an evil spirit called the Queen had upon his mind, as he slowly finds himself overpowered by the forces of darkness as they eat away at his very sanity...\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the video game series but I did own part 4 on Playstation and I suppose it's a good idea to base the movie on, both the game and movie are somewhat similar. There are a lot of Uwe Boll haters out there. I however, think he's a decent action director. Some of the visuals he can create can be pretty cool to watch.\n\nBoll's last film, House of the Dead (universally hated by the entire world) is the only other film of his that I remember seeing and in comparison, he's taken a step up with Alone in the Dark. Maybe it was better because there was a little more substance to this plot, maybe because there was a little more to know in this movie, maybe it was because they have some better actors in this film, who knows? Now, I'm not a fan of any of the actors in this film. If I had to choose the best actor, I'd have to go with Dorff because I own a few of his other films on DVD. Slater has always been a borderline actor and seems to keep it together in this film but is slowly dragged down by his co-star Tara Reid who will annoy you with her explosive mouth and whorish face. She really is annoying! Alone in the Dark never really gave me the action I craved until the end and by that time, the movie had already failed me. A big issue is that I'm not entertained by movies just using 3 minutes of continuous gunfire. It's not exactly exciting to see a bunch of bullets flying at the screen, it's too repetitive.\n\nI didn't mind the monsters, they seemed to stay true to the game, visually (as I recall). The CGI in the movie is generally questionable, yet bearable. I really like the music from the soundtrack in the first scene of uncontrollable gunfire where the screen kept going black when being attacked by those creatures. Usually heavy metal doesn't mix well with most scenes in movies, although I do feel as though it's a good testosterone builder, they did will with the music in this film. \"Ghost\" by Mnemic is a cool song, been listening to it on the soundtrack ever since early 2005.\n\nThe movie suffers from seemingly washed up talent, pointless plot progression and a confusing director. Somehow they manage to keep the film within some kind of boundaries of toleration but that all depends on how far away you draw your lines."

As a matter of fact, quite a lot of the plot elements don't really serve much purpose. Ewe Boll is a pathetic director. People have been claiming that he's a modern day Ed Wood, but at least Ed Wood genuinely TRIED. This guy just doesn't care at all. I'm incredibly disgusted that he will be directing the movie version of Hunter: The Reckoning, especially since this will be the first Whitewolf game to become a movie, and with him at the helm it will assuredly be the last.

I also think that the Alone in the Dark story and world makes for a perfect Horror/Thriller/Detective movie, but don't be fooled by the genre label. We are presented with a story that I think is appropriate and interesting, but it's presented in such a bad way that you after a while has forgotten all about the story and instead wonder if you are watching a bad music video. Or maybe a children's cartoon, due to the childish comments that sometimes is made when trying to advance the plot.\n\nAt one point in the movie we are also presented with a soft sex scene, which doesn't add anything to the movie, instead it's increasing the feeling that we are watching a long and bad music video.\n\nThe director seams to have added the music from his own personal favorite collection without any thought of that the music should at least add to the atmosphere of the movie. But instead of scary music that adds to the tension and excitement, which should have been an element in an Alone in the Dark movie, we have to listen to cool hard rock while our invincible superhero is blasting his way through the hordes of evil monsters that is after him. Although I like the music, it totally destroys any tiny bit of atmosphere that might have been there.\n\nAnd what I have already briefly mentioned is that our hero, Edward Carnby, is engaged in open combat instead of trying to build up a good horror tension. A feeling of where you don't know what are out in the dark trying to get you, like in the video games, which had us all on our heels while we played them. No, Edward is never alone in the dark in this movie.\n\nThe whole experience makes me wonder if the director has even played at least one Alone in the Dark game for at least five minutes. It more feels like his been disappointed by that he hasn't been chosen to make a Blade movie, and wants to show the world that he could have made a Blade movie (which isn't much to brag about), or if he has had any education in storytelling at all.\n\nI'm so disappointed in this movie that I had to sign up here, vote, and make my first review. And I feel sad for Christian Slater, who is a good actor, and really makes the best he can out of what he has to work with. And he would have been perfect as Edward under different circumstances."

And Tara Reid, who I feel sorry for because her public image has spiraled down (I was a huge fan of her Bunny Lebowski character in 'The Big Lebowski', even though that wasn't a huge stretch. She's so unbelievably bad. And Stephen Dorff didn't want to be there, it seemed. Why Boll... Why? Why zombies again?! Did you want to fix the HotD mistake? That was a throw-away storyline that didn't serve any point and was BOR-ING.

Earlier in the day i had the song 'Seven Seconds' by Youssou Ndour running through my head. THEN i heard it during that sex scene. I knew i was in for trouble. It was some kind of bad omen. If anyone reads this and wants to see how to do a sex scene that is not interesting, out of place, and HURTS the movie, check this out. But if you blink you'll miss it.\n\nEveryone involved in this cinematic mess should apologize. Boll should be put in a room, forced to watch this movie over and over until he pees his pants and promises never to do it again."

I've never played the video game so I did not enter the theater with undo expectations. If you've seen the commercials for this film they clearly show alieanesque creatures popping up behind a security guard and stabbing him through the head. And I promise you this movie delivers exactly what it promises -- Gratuitus violence that you do not have to think about.\n\nThe evil creatures are cool looking but unoriginal. The machine gun fights and gore are fun. Seeing Slater on the big screen was a great treat for me and all my girlfriends. Although we were wondering why a guy would go to all the trouble of taking off his belt before bed if he wasn't going to take off the pants too. Sorry, no nudity in this film for either gender to enjoy. Slater does a decent job portraying a character you might expected to see on X-files. But Tara Reid really stinks up the screen. Her lines are delivered flat and quiet. I would have preferred her character to simply not exist; after all, I would think that Slater's character would be more well rounded if he was not only the action-hero but also the geeky archaeologist (an Indiana Jones for the new millennium).\n\nIf you ever watch the made for TV movies on Space Channel or Spike I think you'll enjoy this movie because it's definitely a step up from them. Some of the camera shots swing a little wide and the fly-by on the car driving across the bridge is just hilarious -- the camera is actually bobbing up and down. It's obviously a lower budget flick. I would recommend going to see this one in the dollar theaters.\n\nIf you go to this film just sit back, relax, enjoy the firefights and laugh at some of the goofy plot twists. And if you're Canadian enjoy the familiar scenery because absolutely no effort is made to hide the fact that they are in Vancouver, BC."

It's about being entertained for an hour and a half to two hours and we're not professional movie reviewers who comment on bad acting and how movies are made. I say this because the movie was by far not the worst movie ever made and the plot, in my opinion, was a mad man trying to unleash creatures from another dimension who destroyed some Indian tribe 10,000 years ago. He enlists the help of 20 orphans now adults to help him accomplish this. I was never confused like some reported. It was all right there to follow and having Christian Slater and Stephen Dorf to look upon was also enjoyable for this lady. The creatures were obviously computer generated because there were so many but they moved so fast that you didn't get to look too long and then criticize them. So I did not waste $5 for matin\u00e9e prices as I was indeed entertained and taken out of reality for an hour and a half. I say see movies without looking too deeply. Although, I did agree that HIDE AND SEEK sucked balls."

Also the action scenes are rewriting the way the action movie genre should be made.In 1999 the Matrix came and shows as the slow-motion effects and extreme gunfight and kung-fu fight.Now in 2004 A.I.T.D. show how fighting scenes should be made using advanced slow-mo effects combined with first-year karate school class fighting.Also gun-fighting using rapidly cut-scenes so you wont understand what is happening gives more to the atmosphere of lostness in the movie.And i wont forget to note to the originality of this movies monsters (It is know that the Aliens movie that is coming out next year would steal the look of the monsters but Uwe Boll would be suing them don't worry fans!)Also by giving the special effects of the monsters a \"crappy\" and with \"bad-motion\" style makes the movie looks like some 70s classic movie where the special effects just appeared(Star wars!)This fact make this movie appear in the top sci-fi movies of all time among with the action ones.There are more to notice like the original movie scope and flawless movie pace that doesn't make you sleep but i rather watch this movie again that commenting on it.Uwe Bollyou changed my life with this movie.I want to be a filmmaker like you...Enjoy it"

This is considered one of his worst films and one of his worst reviewed films since it was one of his biggest. Based on a video game (having not played) I had no thoughts how decent an adaptation of the movie is to the game. With this movie, it is everything in which it has been criticized for. It is terrible, messy, confusing and hard to follow. Things do occur but it is confusing and a boring watch. The film takes itself too serious which hurts it.\n\nIt isn't one of those typical cheesy \"it's so bad it's good\" films that are bad films but still entertaining and unintentionally funny. Alone in the Dark is just bad and it isn't funny. For a decent sized budget film (having a $20 million budget), Alone in the Dark feels cheap and the story is very weak. There could have been at least some thrills, suspense or jump scenes but it was very bland, uninteresting and even the creatures looked unsatisfying. This felt more like a cheap Sci- Fi low budget television series if anything. In the end, you may find yourself wondering what you have just watched and what the film was about."

Then the Christian Slater character is given a ham fisted voice over to further hand out information to the audience. There is just way too much back story going on for a movie with such a simple premise. The movie is a boring grind. At some level exploitation movies can get by with being ridiculous with sheer visceral impact (i.e. Violence and T&A). Alone in the Dark even fails at this. The action is pedestrian, uninspiring lifts from superior movies. And the sex scene could be shown on the PAX network. Not even close to being bad enough to be fun. 1 star."

        "review_detailed_main": "I will watch just about anything. It's a problem sometimes. Uwe Boll's reputation precedes him, as does that of 'Alone in the dark' specifically. Given an opportunity to watch this infamous film for myself, I couldn't refuse.\n\nIs it really that bad?\n\nI'm not sure what the opposite is of being impressed - and a thesaurus is no great help in this case - but 'Alone in the dark' seems to work tirelessly from the very beginning to make sure we are that. One full minute of exposition in the form of scrolling text on the screen, accompanied by a voiceover. A flashback, to a couple decades past, transitions quickly and haphazardly to the beginning of the narrative - where right away the screenplay announces itself as blunt, direct, and direly lacking in all subtlety. That happens again in the next scene. And the next. And the next. And...\n\nStar Christian Slater's opening narration, introducing his character to the audience, exemplifies the definition of \"phoned in.\" The speedy shift to an action sequence is chock-full of effects, camerawork, and choreography that seemingly tries to imp the grandiosity of more celebrated thrillers, but far less convincingly. And so far we're only 15 minutes in.\n\nIs 'Alone in the dark' really that bad? Even having seen Boll's 'In the name of the king,' and knowing the poor regard this is kept in broadly, I wasn't fully prepared for what I was committing to watching. Yes: It pretty much is exactly that bad.\n\nStory beats consistently strain credulity. I'm given to understand that Boll had a hand in rewriting the screenplay to his own ends, but I have a hard time believing that the credit given to other screenwriters here means that they weren't just as complicit. What we get are flat, hollow characterizations; cheap thrills; hack dialogue; tepid action sequences; and an overall plot that is carelessly conceived, and flimsy.\n\nThe original score in the film is at once both unremarkable and over the top; every band who contributed to the accompanying soundtrack should be ashamed of themselves. The effects, from slow motion and gunfire to blood and gore, mostly reek of the same malodorous, heavy hand as the screenplay. That goes as well for the direction, which would be less than noteworthy if not for Boll's failure to compose very conventional shots with the same steadiness and practiced dexterity of countless other film-makers.\n\nI do genuinely like a few instances of design in the sets and props. There are some very recognizable and admirable names in the cast, including and not limited to star Slater, Mark Acheson, Frank C. Turner, and Stephen Dorff. Unfortunately, between Boll's direction and the collectively botched writing, these performers are at best gone to waste. Much has been made of Tara Reid's performance, and I ever hesitate to leap to conclusions about an actor's skills in a picture that's generally lackluster. Unfortunately, in this case, I think it's safe to say that Reid also has something to answer for in 'Alone in the dark.' I don't want to judge the whole of her career on this one film, but her contribution to the mess that this turned out to be is no less dubious.\n\nAn action sequence about halfway through weirdly feels unexpectedly inspired - yet if it felt a little overdone at the start, it only becomes more so as it goes on. At that point I had a moment where I allowed myself to hope that the movie had gotten all of its questionable bombast out of the way, and things would improve in the second half of the length. They didn't. Not really.\n\nAgainst all odds, there are some worthwhile ideas here. In much more capable hands, this movie could and should have been a fun supernatural horror thriller, emphasizing unseen terrors in the dark against the backdrop of ancient myth and legend. Instead, such concepts are all but entirely subsumed in the drive to fill the duration with action.\n\nAnd then there's the ending. All I can say is that the last 5 minutes, following the climax, manages to outdo all that came before it: The denouement is so poorly conceptualized, disjointedly written, and altogether egregiously ill-considered that it blasts away whatever minimal value the film may have held previously. Despite everything, up to this moment I was prepared to say that I've still seen worse movies. Now I'm not so sure.\n\n'Alone in the dark' is so bad that it can't even elicit a derisive laugh. My curiosity got the best of me and I felt compelled to watch it, but now I'm somewhat inclined to think that was a mistake. Unless you're a masochist who purposefully seeks out cinematic torment, I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone."

You'd be wrong.\n\nI will devote the rest of this post to making sure you don't even waste even a second of your time (not to mention the $4 charge at Blockbuster) watching this misbegotten train wreck of a movie. Look at it this way: I suffered thorough it to spare you, my dear reader. You may thank me later.\n\nThis movie manages to make even the rock-bottom standards for any movie based on a video game seem set, by comparison, impossibly high. I've never played \"Alone in the Dark,\" but I can only hope that the plot, acting and special effects are better than the movie version. The only thing that doesn't fall short of expectations is Tara Reid.

Bring back selected members of the crew and all of the principal cast (except for Tara Reid - just cast anyone in her intended role, no one will notice), work on the project for a few months and you will have a REAL adaptation of the game, and financial and critical success are yours!\n\nIn short, this is basically a bad but inoffensive action horror film, made worse and offensive by trying to be linked to a great and historic game series (no 'Alone in the Dark' games, no 'Resident Evil'). Actors Dorff and Slater, highly talented, highly unappreciated, and this doesn't help matters!\n\nF - DO OVER!"

I must say that I'm noticing a frequent occurrence in your movies (House of 1000 corpses, Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne) They all have similarities that I'm going to point out whether this helps you out or not. 1: The use of to much blood. (If it starts to look like a can of red paint exploded, or looks like someone cleverly painted *blood* on a scene you have gone overboard) 2: The use of useless and or random sex scenes. (I personally think that a good movie doesn't need this, and if a movie really needs to have one of these scenes then it should be classified as porn) 3: Horrible continuity problems. Please check your films carefully after filming. In Alone in the Dark the sand worm scene when the lady was killed by the sandworms and left to die just before the last person leaves you see her start to get up. Hello, didn't she just die? Oh and watch that the script matches the movie. The last scene when Christian Slater says \"The gate had finally been closed\" Umm it was blown up, not closed. I could honestly keep telling you what you need to check before sending the film to print, but I think others will have their say soon enough. The noted 3/10 means that I personally think your work has improved. It is also rather low to show that it still needs work, but it's getting there!"

Her acting was awful, almost laughable. She tried to play a scientific type role, including wearing a pair of geeky black rimmed glasses, but she ended up looking like she belonged an a high school drama club rendition of some bad Broadway musical.\n\nChristian Slater was no better and what was with the long suede jacket? Please give me a break! His acting was somewhat better than Reid but overall he stunk too. I think it's time to hang up his acting career and he best find a different job, because in this movie he seemed old and washed out.\n\nThe movie just kept going on and on with no understandable, logical story line, or should say they didn't stick to one discernible story line through out the movie, they just kept flipping or shuffling from plot to plot all with different goals? Does that make any sense? NO? I didn't think so, but that is exactly what happened in the movie. Maybe you will be able to figure it out for yourself."

She said it was so bad she couldn't let us pay for it, even after it was explained that we only wanted to see it to see how bad it was.\n\nSo anyway, we watched it.\n\nOkay, I must admit I didn't think it was THAT bad. I've certainly seen worse movies this year, (The Cave anyone?), and it was SOOOOOO much better than House Of The Dead. Captain Kirk indeed. And the much maligned text scroll that opens the movie, well it wasn't that long. And the CGI wasn't that bad. Sure it didn't make ANY sense, had no suspense, had a godawful script and crap characters but does it really deserve all the hate? Because there is a lot of hate.\n\nMethinks Uwe Boll did such a number on House Of The Dead, it's kind of bled over to Alone In The Dark, and will continue to color peoples' perception of him forever. And Ever. Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending him at all. It takes a special kind of director to birth such a pile of ass like H O T D. Ed Wood comes to mind. But was Alone In The Dark really that bad? Although Tara Reid WAS all kinds of wrongness times infinity. Her expression after she smacked Mr Slater in the face was priceless. I think the script called for 'Angry' (Which you'd think would've been one of the first lessons earned at acting school), but what we got was 'Constipated' crossed with 'I forgot to return my Library Book'. Stunning. Also, I must mention her line delivery. It appears that English is not her first language. Either that or she was being fed her lines via a hidden device in her ear. By a six year old.\n\nSo this isn't really a review as such, which is appropriate cos' Alone In The Dark isn't really a movie as such. Yes there's noise and lights and 'dramatic' music, but that's all. Oh and a toweringly bad performance from Tara Reid (Bless). But I still didn't think it was THAT bad.\n\nMaybe because it was free."

I have always been a fan of Cristian Slater. I think he's a great actor and maybe this is why I was so disappointed with his performance in \"Alone in the dark\". I also liked Stephen Dorff's performance in Feardotcom. In \"Alone in the dark\" I think, the actors don't get to show their talents. This is a movie so bad, that I find counting grain of sand from the beach is more interesting and exciting than watching this movie. To create a film from a game is hard I think, but still yet possible. This is not even close to what I expected though. To be honest, this is pure crap. I'd like to add that I've never played the game. The story isn't there! It feels like Uwe Boll wanted to create a movie containing explosive scenes and lots of gunshot, that completely missed out on the point. This is a movie that took me 3 hours to watch and it's 96 minutes long. What happened? What did I miss? Some parts of the movie even felt more like you were watching a war, not a horror movie. And so the story? What was it they were fighting? The story doesn't tell. This movie gives a little to much to the imagination. If I want to imagine something, I read a book. This must be the worst movie ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, this movie has received a 2.2 average out of 12319 votes and if that alone doesn't scare you away hopefully my comment will.\n\nFirst off I think Christian Slater is an overrated actor. Sure he's made a name for himself. He did a good work in Interview with the Vampire and he did ride with the brat pack in Young Guns II. But asides from that I think he's received a lot more credit than he's worth.\n\nAnyhow Slater is given a fair amount of monologue in this movie. Up to a point where it becomes tedious in fact and it's also seemingly unmotivated. Speaking of monologues the introduction starts of with a speaker voice and is ridiculously long. If you even bare to remember half of it you're in for a disappointment because they iterate it throughout the entire movie. This film is still a puzzle, my sincerest wish is that they just skipped all attempts at being serious and just went straight for the action.\n\nThen again the action isn't much to brag about either. The camera is flimsy and some of the action scenes are actually left out for some reason. No spoilers here but we're cheated on some mayhem and we always like to see that.\n\nWithout spoiling too much another issue is the scary part of this movie. Or the lack of it. With such flat character portraits you never develop any concern or sympathy for them. And to top it off, none of the actions scenes actually convey any real danger.\n\nWe're also introduced to so many threats and all remains unexplained. Zombies, mad scientist, alien-type monsters and a top secret organization. And because this movie does include a great mystery it's frustrating that they try to serve an answer but ultimately fails.\n\nThe movie also features Tara Reid, an actor we all love to hate and she keeps giving us reason to. Her acting and credibility reaches about as far as I can toss an elephant. She has a bad habit of bringing movies down a notch and she doesn't make an exception for Alone in the Dark. Her acting is 100% emotionless.\n\nTo summarize this I just want to say that I gave this movie 1 star rating. I'm fairly certain it's a bit harsh, it probably deserves 2, maybe even 3. But because this is a fairly high budget movie with reasonably known (and well payed) actors it's a surprise it fails so miserably and does so entirely on it's won."

        "review_detailed_main": "I want to start out by saying that some of my favorite directors are German (Fritz Lang, Werner Herzog, not a huge Fassbinder fan, but I can respect his work). But how the hell could a country that produced \"Metropolis\" give birth to the director of this movie? I am flabbergasted by how awful this film was. It wasn't a campy, \"so bad, it's good\" kind of film. It just plain sucked. Maybe I was expecting too much from a film based on a video game and the guy who directed \"House of the Dead,\" but still.\n\nGeorge Lucas once said that special effects without a story are pretty boring, this waste of cinematography definitely enforces that sentiment. The special effects were OK, but there wasn't any kind of hook to keep them together. The acting was sub-par in my opinion and the story line was complete crap.\n\nThe story is that Carnby (Christian Slater) is a paranormal investigator who has a past with a secret government experiment. The experiment was to open the doorway to an evil dimension and use kids with demons implanted in them to help take over the world. At some time in the past, Carnby either left or was kicked out of the government agency that tried to use him as a human guinea pig (bear with me, I'm trying to make sense out of this heap of cow dung). After finding an ancient artifact that can open the gate, he is hunted by these evil demons along with a female scientist (Tara Reid trying to act smart) and the head of his old department (Stephen Dorff trying to make a quick buck). Throw in an evil scientist, automatic weapons, and some Matrix style special effects and you've got a recipe for disaster.\n\nWhat were they thinking when they made this? There is no real redeeming factor in this film. You can't really sympathize with any of the characters because you've seen the plot so many times and done so much better that it's really not worth it.\n\nThis could vie for the worst film made thus far this century. To Hollywood: please, for the love of all that is sacred stop making films based on video games."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alone in the Dark is proof that people really need to see things for themselves before judging them. I remember the movie lasting barely two weeks at the box office, and getting a 1% rating at Rotten Tomatoes.com. After listening to my friend's rambling about how this was the worst movie ever made, that the director Uwe Boll needed to be be loaded as cargo on a kamikaze plane, I decided to stay clear of it entirely.\n\nWell, by some funny accident, I saw it anyway. I rented Shaun of the Dead last night and found a DVD for Alone in the Dark sitting snugly in its place with \"Haha, LOSER,\" written across disk instead. I figured that since this would probably be the only time I would ever be able to see it, because I would have never rented it on my own time.\n\nI must admit that having extremely low expectations had something to do with it, but I didn't find this movie to be nearly as bad as most people said it was. Sure folks, it's bad, maybe even Razzie worthy, but it had enough style to stay entertaining.\n\nThe movie opens up with some painfully slow text that moves up the screen, spoon-feeding you the plot within 60 seconds. One thing to note is that this was actually a bit of a bonus, because without it the actual movie would have been too confusing to stand. The action sets in fast enough, and our main hero does battle with some random character who's role isn't even made clear until HALFWAY through the film.\n\nThat's the major weakness of Alone in the Dark. The plot and story telling isn't exactly solid gold, it's more like rusted copper. The movie is inept, confusing, hard to follow for the first 30 minutes. There are a lot of things that could have made it much better. A different style of editing, better music, and some proper research on military tactics and protocol could have really done wonders for the whole project.\n\nAs far as acting, the only thing it has going for it is Christian Slater, who pulls off a great performance. The rest of the cast is mediocre at best, and the line delivery is sometimes clumsy enough to land most of them in a special education school.\n\nThe score is about twice as messy as the script for the film. It's horrible, and the guy who composed it should be doing music for elevators. The action that goes with it is some of the most stylish and entertaining I've seen, but a lot of it is pointless, and just isn't a part of the story.\n\nThe monsters themselves are extremely cool, and for the first time since The Lost World we're reminded that shading and atmosphere are just as important as the CGI itself. It's damn good, and the creatures look realistic enough to be put in a zoo.\n\nOn that note, there's enough in Alone in the Dark for me to enjoy it at least, but it's a mess of mindless action, horrid writing and some of worst music I've heard in a long time.\n\n4/10 stars"

But we stuck through it ... the only reason for me coming to watch the movie was because i thought with such good actors as Dorf and Slater, the movie should be good. But I was wrong. Script was bad. Acting surprisingly was REALLY bad. the plot ... looking for a word worse that pathetic! The creatures were taken from the set of 'Aliens'.\n\nNext time I will make sure to come to IMDb and check what people have to say before going to watch a movie!"

He can take bad ideas and make them dire. He can take poor scripts and make them appalling. What elevates his talent to the level of genius is that he seems to be blissfully unaware of his cataclysmic lack of talent.\n\nAlone in the Dark is the epitome of his poor film-making. There are absolutely no redeeming features to this film. It is dire beyond belief. I'm surprised that anyone involved in this film ever worked again."

But in this flick (as in give it the flick) they all rave about it, and they're probably not on drugs. Christian Slater, with all the sensitivity of a brick, purrs (during the interview when a bad actor is screaming in the background) that it is 'Purrfection!'.\n\nAnd a special mention to groanmeister Stephen Dorff (he even beats Stephen Segal) - if they ever need an actor to play someone suffering from severe constipation for an hour and a half, he's your man!"

Alone In The Dark is now considered one of the worst movies ever made. As I weigh the evidence in question I must admit that while this remains a strong contender in the making, I can't think that this would deserve such a title. I mean it is a strong 1/2 star rating, I couldn't give this a full star if I tried. There are a couple of chuckles to be had, such as Tara Reid as a scientist who seems to unleash the intellectual within, by just wearing glasses. Honestly watching Tara Reid try to act as a very educated scientist is almost like passing a kidney stone. (And I know this pain since I passed one when I was 19) It is truly painful to watch. Still it is Christian Slater who earns most of the sympathy here. Slater was in True Romance and Heathers, both of which are great movies and to see him in crap like this, well it is a sadness that even I can't put into words. Still it is one of those movies that rips off Resident Evil, Aliens, The Hidden and any Albert Pyun movie of your choice. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies of the decade, however to be the worst movie ever, I'd hate for such a boring movie to earn this slot. After all we all know that Troll 2 and From Justin To Kelly is funnier!\n\n1/2* out of 4-(Awful)"

There were ridiculously unnecessary love scenes, horribly trite fighting sequences, and a whole army that seemed like they were so inept, you wish the police would just show up and kill the monsters instead of them.\n\nTara Reid was mediocre, Christian Slater was overacting (again), and Stephen Dorff was short (I mean, I've never seen him this short in a film)...sure that's not criticism on the acting, but you can guess that the director just wanted this film pushed into the public's eye way too soon. He should've taken his time with this film to let the audience understand more about what's going on and why we should care.\n\nThe music was boring and used the same sad violin loop over and over...sucked. The details that the director thought were going to be easy in the film seemed to not fit the film (ie the shooting sequences that looked as if the actors were digitally placed in the frames to make it look eerie but instead looked cheesy). The story was completely unbelievable as well, which just makes me wonder who green-lighted this project film anyways.\n\nI had to give the film a 1/10 stars. Not even worth the money shelled out to these filmmakers to make. I would have to say that the preview at least has a Godsmack song (it doesn't appear in the film) and good directing for a preview, and I typically hate previews. If you own this, burn it."

        "review_detailed_main": "What should I say to this . . . The actors are bad, very bad, even amateurs would have done the job better. In one moment you hear \"What are you doing here. You're not working for us anymore\" and about 10 minutes later the same character says \"What are you going to do no\". . There is no passion behind the acting, the characters don't live in the movie they are like puppets, objects, life forms ( definitively not humans ) without a soul. Also those section 713 ( is this correct, well I call them so ) people, they act like from a cheap movie where some special forces have to stop some bad guys.\n\nThe effects looked like done with a 15$ animation software. Cheaply realized, there is no WOW effect when seeing those \"monsters\", actually they're in the movie for what . . . one minute. Something people fear of should be visible for at least 5 minutes.\n\nWe get to know some facts by the \"voice\" and then the rest of the movie we have to figure out who who is. Some characters are mentioned for a couple of times, they're connected with others in the movie, but their story isn't built up. Only the keywords, you can call it this way, are told and the rest is up to your imagination.\n\nFor the beginning . . . It would have been better that they show how those guys come to get the kids and one of them runs away, he's running, hiding, full of fear . . . and then the camera zooms in to the eyes. You hear how the kid is breathing, and then the sound changes, you hear how an older person breathes, the camera zooms out and you see this kid many years later hiding from authorities down in Peru or Chile ( wherever he was for the artifact ) running away, because he has stolen some old cultural artifact. He's also chased by some guy that works for this professor . . . . and then back to the US this chase keeps going on. Edward Carnby kills this big guy and while escaping from the scene the cops get him. Since this paranormal guys have access to many databases and see that Carnby is at the police station and they get him out, take the artifact and tell him to stay out of the paranormal things because he's not in the team anymore. Carnby's contact at the section smuggles the artifact out of the headquarters and while meeting with him, this doc get's killed . . . and so on.\n\nThere is no tension in the movie, it's somehow flat, simple, dry spoken. The action scenes, if we could call them action scenes, are based on shootings. It's like in those action B-movies where you shoot everything to debris and then clean up the mess with non-existent intellectual power, mind tricks . . .\n\nAlso the ending . . . I didn't get the point why this section 713 has done this to the kids. Maybe I didn't listen to the movie, but I didn't get the point of this little experiment. No, no, no . . . This movie is not even long enough to work out the story. A movie that tells such a story should be at least 130 minutes long. How would The lord of the rings look like if the story was told in 90 minutes? I think it would look bad.\n\nAynway, Alone in the Dark is a movie that should be screened in movie classes so people can learn out of the mistakes that have been done here. Upcoming actors, directors, FX people, etc, should see how their future projects shouldn't look like. At lest something positive about the movie."

The director manages to miss on every cue that might make this film worth watching. The camera-work is inept at its best. The storyline is sorely absent. The whole \"bureau\" deal makes the story even less credible than it is in the VG. Giving the protagonists a half-baked and totally unmotivated love interest makes it even more pathetic. None of the horror, the disturbing atmosphere of the huge estate or the creepy feeling of paranoia manages to push through dense wall of \"running about guns blazing\" that that is unequaled even in the western genre, or indeed in war films. Every minute of it seemed like an hour, and if I see another lame explosion like all the ones in this film, I'll throw up."

This is actually the first of Uwe's films that I've watched, and I didn't think it could be so bad as people told me. But I stand corrected. The only time I think this might be worth seeing is when you got a huge hangover and it doesn't matter what you really watch, or if you happen to be a fanatic Reid or Slater fan. In which case the movie doesn't matter anyway. The reason I still gave it a 3is that I reserve my 1 for those few movies that makes you sick they where ever made. And my 2 for those that can barely be watched. Besides the bad story, half bad acting and the so so effects you can still watch this movie but not much more.

Why this man is allowed anywhere near a movie camera or film studio simply does not make the slightest bit of sense.\n\nThe one significant achievement of this movie is that it did consistently get worse at it went along, and progressively made less and less sense. Alone in the Dark is the second foray into American released film-making by Uwe Boll, and it appears he did not learn much from his first attempt. While this movie is a tad better than House of the Dead, it would be a lot like is saying a 47% is better than a 46.9%. On more than one occasion, I had to stifle my disbelief with alcohol. Even then, the movie was just terrible.\n\nAlone in the Dark is a confused film, as it tries to go into different genres. It tries to fit in action, horror, and sci-fi all into one movie, and the way that it tries to pull it off just doesn't work. The problem with the movie is not only is it too busy, but the movie isn't very exciting. The action sequences are fairly ho-hum, the sci-fi isn't anything new, and the horror is not remotely scary and the plot of Alone in the Dark is confusing in itself. The actors' performances are nothing to get excited about. Christian Slater has seen better days, and he tries to make do with the material that he has. Stephen Doriff gave a good performance, but his talent is wasted with little time in the movie. Tara Reid should also never have been cast in this movie, she is out of her depth on a few occasions, and giving her character a pair of glass's in an attempt to make her look intelligent really backfired.\n\nUwe Boll's problem on the other hand, is not that the man receives funding to do his movies. Okay, I suppose that is a problem, but I'm not talking about it the same way that most other people will. Uwe knows what goes into making an action scene or a horror scene, yet he doesn't know what exactly makes it work.\n\nMy advice? Don't even waste your money renting this unless you are a connoisseur of terrible films."

I watched the \"Behind the scenes\" feature on the DVD and could readily see why the film was so bad. The director and writer reminded me of people you meet on public transportation but wish you hadn't. They go on and on about how cool and exciting the action and effects are until you think you're listening to a couple of 8-year-olds tell you about their video game obsessions. I felt bad for Christian Skater, a really fine actor mostly, who had to sit on camera and hype this crap with a straight face.

All you have to do is ask yourself \"What would be the most stupid, clich\u00e9 & pointless thing to happen now?\" The results: Astounding accuracy.\n\nThere is simply no reason to have made this movie, and no excuse for having released it. It's bad enough to base a movie on a video game, but a bad ATARI game?? The \"Contains Spoiler\" button is entirely useless for this film, since there's no story to follow, and therefore, no ending to ruin. We knew when we started it (my spouse & myself) that it was a bad movie; we tuned it in on purpose, as we were mocking & trashing movies way before MST came along. If you enjoy doing that, this is one for you!\n\nStory: Nonexistent. My guess is that they had the three writers it took to dumb it down so far each play the game. Once. Then write it down. There were VERY long expositional titles at the beginning, the reason for which I suspect is that the first scenes of the film were SO bad, they cut them all. Characters: Plastic, one-dimensional, clich\u00e9, and disposable. We're given nothing to care about, and no character to identify with. It was intended to be Christian Slater, of course, but Mr. Slater manages to conjure indifference to his characters in most movies he's made. He is also not to be forgiven for the Broadway \"The Glass Menagerie\" collusion, also in 2005 when this \"film\" was released. Mediocre to begin with, offending members of Actors Equity was not a smart career move. Tara Reid was just as dull, & no chemistry existed between her & Slater, nor anyone else. Reid, whom I've never found interesting, has hit 30, and her midriff-baring costumes and blonde hair have probably carried her as far as she's going to go. The rest of the cast, utterly forgettable & horribly directed; the only mystery is what Stephen Dorff was doing in this movie?\n\nThe dividing line between Uwe Boll's scenes and those of the 1st & 2nd unit directors is the widest that I have ever seen. The unit directors turned in wretched work, and it seems like the only instruction they gave the actors in those scenes was \"Don't blink, it makes it more tense and exciting.\" Wrong!\n\nThe CG effects, which one would suppose were intended to be a selling point, were clearly and nearly entirely lifted from the game. Monsters pop up in video games unexpectedly and for no reason except to shoot yourself some points. No more logic than that in the movie.\n\nThis is cinematic garbage, and there is no saving grace anywhere in it. Well, there IS the fact that it eventually ends. While my spouse & I had a rollicking time trashing it, that's about all it's good for. Anyone looking for a good movie should avoid this one like the plague."

As I love watching things that are so bad that they become unintentionally funny again, it was with quite a lot of anticipation that I picked it up for a couple of euros. I was disappointed. While \"Alone in the Dark\" is by no means a good film (OK, it is indeed pretty bad), it's by no means as spectacularly bad as often advertised.\n\nInstead, it's the \"completely forgettable and utterly tedious\"-kind of bad. Very loosely based on a video game series, it tells the story of third-rate Indiana Jones-clone Christian Slater in his search for old Indian relics and a gateway to hell. In between, it throws in Alien-like monsters, horrifying cross-breeding experiments, brain parasites and a lot more. There's so much going on with so little explanation or coherence (inspite the longest and most tedious text-only prologue in movie history) that it becomes very hard to figure out what is going on.\n\nNot that that matters much, though, as it is very hard to care about the plot of the characters. Eventually, I just gave trying to make sense of everything (a futile task anyway) and simply stayed watching for the action.\n\nJudged solely by that, \"Alone in the Dark\" is not a total loss. There are actually some fairly decent action sequences on display, and while they also lack much in the way of logic or coherence, they at least show some level of competence. The same can be said about the acting: it's by no means Oscar material, but it does get the job done.\n\nIn the end, there is no question that this is a bad movie. The characters are utterly forgettable and the plot is a colossal mess of dozens of half-baked. That being said, it's leaps and bounds above some truly horrendous movies of recent years, like \"Torque\" or \"Battlefield Earth\", which, in addition to being utterly incoherent, also looked dreadful and were truly horrible acted.\n\nOn the other hand, those movies were so bad that they became unintentionally funny. There will be a place for these truly terrible movies in \"Worst 100\"-list for years to come. \"Alone in the Dark\", on the other hand, is flat-out boring from start to finish, and should be left in the dark and forgotten as soon as possible.\n\n*1/2 out of *****"

It made me sleepy so I thought it was just my like of coherence from time to time.\n\nThe tagline for this movie is, Evil awakens, but for me, it almost put me to sleep for real.\n\nAnd ironically, it's not even that dark of a movie. I mean, it's in bright as day sunlight a lot of it. And while I'm on it, never once is anyone even alone in the film.\n\nI'll say this.\n\nI really, really like all of the actors involved and I still do, even after my viewing.\n\nI think they really, really tried.\n\nI enjoy Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff together. I never really noticed it before, but they could be brothers.\n\nTara Reid is a total fox, especially as a scientist in this production. I thought she gave a more than adequate performance given the material.\n\nLook, I know it's 2023 and it hasn't happened yet, but she will win an Oscar one day. The right script will land in her lap and she will conquer that role. It's going to happen.\n\nSo, this movie otherwise lacks identity. It doesn't know what it is or what it wants to be. It wants to be films that are far superior: Aliens, Starship Troopers, maybe even Tremors.\n\nI confess to enjoying the works that I have seen from this director.\n\nThe first BloodRayne, House of the Dead, I've never seen any of his Rampage films.\n\nThis movie is also based on a video game that I'm unfamiliar with.\n\nAt times it plays like a video game.\n\nIt also has a pretty wicked early aughts industrial nu metal soundtrack.\n\nWhich makes more sense than this entire film."

Then I came here and have spent more time than the movie just reading the reviews.\n\nI should have done this in the first place. I still can't stop laughing.\n\nLots of peeps tried really hard to find something good to say about it, but nearly all had to give up. The exceptions were those ultra-shallow folks who will watch anything and can't tell the difference.\n\nPlan 9 From Outer Space, move over. There is now a new title holder for Worst Movie Ever Made. And if you consider that the budget was over $20 million, then there's really no competition.\n\nSo, if you've got this far and haven't seen the film yet, then my advice is: Cut your losses. You're already way ahead if you've read all the reviews. You don't need to see the film. You don't even want to see the film. Trust me."

        "review_detailed_main": "To Uwe Boll:\n\nI think this movie is worst than House of the Dead. And since Uwe Boll take his time to read these reviews,I'm going to help you, Mr. Boll. This movie is a BIG mess.\n\nTo make a movie based on a video game you don't have to make it as crappy as the game. In fact this doesn't look like the game at all. From your comments, you are telling us that if your movie is crappy is not your fault, its the game's fault cause the video game is somehow that way. You are wrong, your movies doesn't have to be identical to games. It just need reference from the game. When you make a movie, you need to make every little detail fit in the story. the introduction could have been better illustrated, there is no chemistry between the two main characters and you don't have feelings for any character so if a character dies you wont miss him/her.\n\nAnother error you made was putting Tara Reid in your movie. She simply sucks, Tara looked like a porn-star dressed as a secretary. The Sex Scene sucks! How can a sex scene suck? The music in the sex scene doesn't belong there. In fact the sex scene doesn't belong in the movie, it is obvious that the sex scene was a filler.\n\nYou once said its not your problem if we don't see an improvement in your movies. Let me tell you that you are wrong again, you want people to look at you in a different way, then prove it. Your movies might improve in technology but they aren't any good if the story you put together doesn't make sense. Then you dare ask yourself why aren't the creators of these games backing you up in this movies you directed. IT is obvious, they rather not get involve because that would mess up their image.\n\nAlso, it doesn't hurt if you look for other things as your source material. How can you look in a video game for source material, when most of the games are inspired by movies or comic. That is why none of your video game-based-movies are original.\n\nI think you have a serious issue, Mr Boll. you think we cant comment on your movies because we aren't directors? We might not know much about making movies, but we do know when a movie is bad. House of the Dead was bad and so was Alone in the dark(i still haven't seen Bloodrayne)\n\nBy the way, YOu get big sales numbers because of the actors. I'm sorry to say it that way, buddy. And i thought you said you learn from your mistakes but all i see are arguments against the people who point out whats terribly wrong with your movies.\n\nUwe, if you ever read this, please, try to make Far Cry as good as possible. Look for guidance, do something, watch First Blood seven times. Meet directors and discuss your idea. And don't leave the viewers with the whys unless its necessary for a sequel. Try to display a coherent story."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Alone in the dark', such an appropriate title. Because that is exactly where you will find yourself if you attempt to rent this movie with friends. The film was directed (and misdirected) by German director, Uwe Boll. With only one previous film under his belt, 'Doctor Boll' has become infamous for creating 2003's outrageously bad video game adaptation 'House of the dead'. Well in January 2005 the mad scientist of video game movies struck again with 'Alone in the dark'. Brace yourselves.\n\n'Alone in the dark' was loosely adapted from the popular Atari video game of the same name. But whatever made the game popular was apparently not present in the movie.\n\nThe movie is ghastly bad. It opens with a 'Star Wars' like white-text-on-black-background scroll that seems to be setting up the story. Except it goes on, and on, for ten incomprehensible paragraphs. And then, as if Boll thinks his audiences don't read, it is seemingly narrated by an over-enthused radio deejay turning the introduction into an ultimately confusing waste of time. After the scroll has mercilessly concluded we are launched into a prologue set 22 years earlier in an orphanage where a child is being chased through the woods.\n\nFinally we make it to the present day where there is a world of darkness beyond ours filled with monsters that wiped out an entire civilization called \"the Abkani\". A government agency known as 713 must defeat the remainder of the monsters before they destroy mankind. The main character Edward (Christian Slater), who was once apart of this agency, is a \"paranormal investigator\" (wtf?) trying to solve the mystery of his orphaned childhood. There is also a sub-plot involving mind-controlling parasites if you can believe it.\n\nThe mysteriousness of the plot is further added to by the arrival of party girl Tara Reid, outrageously miscast as an archaeologist. Her character, Aline was apparently a former lover of Edwards and, as if every clich\u00e9 imaginable hasn't already been used, greets Edward with a punch in the face and \"I thought you were dead a-hole\".\n\nThe production quality of this movie is average. The fight scenes appear to have been choreographed by a Kung Fu master and Boll has overused the slow motion matrix-like effect. The wardrobe looks as though a hip-hop video will start at any second. Some of the actors appear to have not learned their lines properly and stumble during simple word exchanges. Reid clearly doesn't know the meaning of any of the four syllable science words she has to say and gives a very unconvincing performance as a smart person. Throughout the beginning of the movie her portrayal of an archaeologist includes wearing glasses and scribbling nonsense on a clipboard when she's not even working on anything. I couldn't help a silent chuckle as her character said \"I need to analyze these artifacts some more\".\n\nThe dialogue is even worse. Slater has countless cryptic lines about his fear of the dark including \"being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive\" and \"There's a price to pay for bringing darkness into the light\". All the while Reid sounds like she's reading movie taglines uttering, \"Some doors are meant to stay shut\". Every line read by everyone else is intended to deliver a new piece of vital information. No character development. No plot development. No good.\n\nThe acting, or lack of it, may be worthy of 'the Days of our lives'. All the actors appear as if they're embarrassed to be there. The CGI monsters give a more convincing performance then most of the cast.\n\nBehind the scenes doesn't look much better either. Partnered up with screenwriter Elan Matsai (who might I add also wrote a movie called MVP2: Most Vertical Primate), Boll has managed to create the worst film of the decade. That is the only accomplishment here. Now all the other bad film makers can be proud that they didn't make 'Alone in the dark'.\n\nIt's hard to find a film that is so inept on almost every level. Production quality, editing, the musical score, acting, even the extras seem to have been chosen for their background incompetence.\n\nOn the bright side, this movie could have been really very good had there been some acknowledgement in the opening scroll that the whole thing was meant to be a joke. But it isn't. Doctor Boll is serious. So take a look around while watching 'Alone in the dark', because you may just find yourself alone in the theater as well."

Eh, wait...why? And then something else happens. And the SFX is bad too. If you turn the sound off and just look at the pictures, you might get fooled into believing that it is a professional movie. Because on the surface, it kind of do look like that. But watch it for real and you will just sit there shaking your head, wondering how they raised the money to do this huge pile of crap. AVOID!!!!"

        "review_title": "Maybe good enough for TV-- in the 1970's?",
        "review_detailed_main": "If it was made in the 1970's: I would have found this movie watchable, in a nostalgic, late-night re-run, how-times-have-changed kind of way. Except that in this case, time seems to have stopped for the makers of this movie: sets look like sets and lighting looks like lighting, acting looks like acting and dialogue sounds like dialogue , edits look like edits and effects look like effects... must I go on? Which is really sad to see since there was already much better TV in the 1970's and there are definitely much better TV features or series now.\n\nWhat I mean is that almost every piece of scenery, action and dialogue made me do a double-take and go \"oh, they're TRYING to show me that....\" And my theory is that instead of working within their means and talents, the film-makers preferred to \"stretch themselves\" by going for everything they wanted in the film-- even if they could only do it in a half-baked manner. I can't say if this is the worst movie I've seen, but I understand why people hate it so much-- the times HAVE changed and audiences HAVE moved on....\n\nThe fact that this movie was given a theatrical release tells me that the film-makers don't really realize its lack of potential-- or their lack of ability. So no points awarded for this film & its film-makers being stuck in the time warp of 1970's TV entertainment-- but 1 point for Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff, because I'm a fan, and for their surprisingly sober performances in a movie which should have just been played for laughs. There are many \"bad\" movie out there with a few good points-- but this is just one mediocre movie with many, many bad parts."

Boll thinks he is misunderstood by viewers? No sire you are not misunderstood we understand you quite well; you are such a bad director that you don't even qualify for mediocrity. I feel bad for any actors who attach themselves to your projects they now have a whole lots of baggage to escape.\n\nAnd now I got look at your profile on IMDb and see that you have several more games into movies you are planning to inflict on us. What did we do to you to deserve such heinous acts? I though Germans had grown past war crimes and the such and were now a peaceful people. Perhaps this is the new German plot? Send America all your tragically untalented directors to destroy American cinema? Don't bother we have enough of our own bad directors who are doing the job quite well.\n\nI urge you the poor undramatized viewer to NOT watch this movie. It's a total waste of time."

Somehow this is a reason to introduce hordes of Alien-like CGI monsters and happenstance action scenes. Don't ask me how. It isn't explained in the movie.\n\nThis could have been a half-decent action flick if it wasn't for the fact that it's \"based\" on a superb game (one that I happen to be a great fan of). The spooky atmosphere of the game series is obviously completely lost on herr Boll. While the original Carnby sneaked through echoing corridors where every sound made the hair on your neck stand out, the movie is a standard pointless non-story about a commando squad shooting and blowing things up for utterly confused reasons. The dots don't even connect between story elements. Characters die en masse, without ever becoming characters.\n\nThis is a bad movie. Not so bad it's good, though. Just bad."

I've seen a million comments on how bad Uwe Boll's video game adaptations are (and I pretty much agree with them). And I've asked myself, how can Uwe make any money? Answer is simple. Hes using German tax loopholes to pay for the production, and all he has to do in return is pay taxes on any profits. By using this system, Uwe has made a pretty penny making garbage films for a living. Bad movies, brilliant profiteer.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwe_Boll"
