        "review_detailed_main": "It's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release. That many movies suck is no surprise, but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time, the process of movie-going becomes a passion play of sorts. Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hollywood, then, that \"Aeon Flux\" isn't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect, given the above. Though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws, it at least has (sort of) an idea with which to toy around. Too bad director Karyn Kusama seems to have little clue how to execute it all.\n\nIt's the future. There's been a plague. There is a dictatorship, and there are rebels. The latter are known as the Monicans, and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racket worshipers, they're into attempts to overthrow the former, called the Goodchild regime. The regime is occasionally mean to the citizenry, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and her pals can stand. Through some sort of biochemical virtual reality technology, the Monicans receive orders from their dear leader (Frances McDormand), a mystical priestess-type who appears to have been cross-bred with a carrot. It falls to Aeon to strap on some form-fitting, futuristic spandex get-ups to carry out the High Carrot's orders, which are of course some version of \"destroy the regime.\" Having years earlier watched her sister get liquidated by the Goodchilds, she needs little convincing.\n\nNot surprisingly, things get complicated. The Goodchilds might not be quite what they seem, and Aeon herself might have an unexpected history with them. Though occasionally muddled, the film's central conceit (of which I won't reveal more) contains some neat notions about the nature of human existence and survival. There's room for much more examination of which the film doesn't take advantage, but the ideas are there, at least. The big problems of \"Aeon Flux\" are technical. Kusama has made the baffling decision to film nearly all the action so close that we can rarely follow what's going on. To make matters worse, it's edited in a flurry of jump cuts that leave us completely lost. The result is some serious spacial disorientation that takes over the film. \"Aeon Flux\"'s aesthetic is one of sleek costume, oddly-angled architecture, and nimble characters. Much of the action occurs in minimalist, open spaces that beg for some unbroken long shots that might convey the grace and athleticism implied by the above. Instead, we get split seconds of flying limbs, breaking glass, and accompanying sound effects.\n\nThere is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the morass of \"Aeon Flux.\" Put this stuff in the hands of the Wachowski brothers, say, and the results could be quite different. As it is, though, I felt like \"Aeon Flux\" was willfully pushing me away from a movie I wanted to enjoy. This film is unattuned to its own strengths. Like a novice poker player dealt a royal flush, it somehow finds a way to lose in spite of its potential."

        "review_detailed_main": "Charlize Theron cuts an exceptionally striking presence as the heroine of this smashing action-oriented fantasy involving a rebel fighter in 2415 whose assignment is to kill the leader of a totalitarian regime; turns out, she recognizes him as a man who once meant a great deal to her and finds she can't eliminate him (nor vice-versa), precipitating a coupe amongst his people. Though exceptionally flashy, this MTV production (based upon their animated series) has its roots steeped in the past, with a plot that admittedly recalls dozens of enemy-for-the-people adventures. Despite some intentionally amusing asides, the dialogue is fairly stilted (though there isn't much of it, which is ultimately a plus) and the editing is occasionally sharp though it eliminates things we should be seeing to clarify the narrative (like how \u00c6on Flux manages to climb aboard and exit a flying monument). Frances McDormand's role as Theron's boss is left a bit sketchy (who does she get her orders from?) and her reluctance to give \u00c6on even the slightest benefit of the doubt is perplexing. The action sequences are elaborately, entertainingly staged, and the crisp, expensive-seeming production gives us a glittering vision of the future (think \"Logan's Run\" on a modern budget). In the end, the film is more a tasty morsel than a satisfying meal--it may slip right out of your consciousness a day after you've seen it--but the misfits-as-rebels angle and the suave star-turns by Theron, Sophie Okonedo (as ever-faithful Sithandra, who has hands for feet) and handsome Marton Csokas (as Trevor Goodchild, who puts all the pieces in place) help make this an enjoyable ride. **1/2 from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "The MTV sci-fi animated series \"\u00c6on Flux\" is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna, 400 hundred years into the future. For her latest mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she uncovers secrets along the way.\n\nAeon Flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. Interesting story yet the film was a little dull. A lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all. It may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best. I have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so I can't compare the two. It's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. The film is not that confusing but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. The acting was alright, nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast also give decent performances including Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including Sithandra, Aeon's friend.\n\nThe problem with Aeon Flux is that it takes itself too seriously. It carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little tiring. There's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the film is so serious, the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are pretty good but that's not what the film is really about so don't go in expecting just an action movie. The twist at the end isn't mind blowing but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting. The visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice. So, the movie may be a case of style over substance. Interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time. In the end, it's not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental. Rating 4/10"

She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, untamable, ambiguous all at once. The original Aeon had layers upon layers of depth. She almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking. You could never tell what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist whereas Trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship.\n\nIn the movie:\n\nAeon Flux works for the Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily tamable, emotional and very predictable. The Aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most. The plot was obvious and contrived. Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides.\n\nThe movie was a horrible disappointment to me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters of all time, squeezed all the depth and personality out of her, and pumped her full of Hollywood clich\u00e9s. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this movie a \"1\" is because the visuals were incredible. It was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with CGI."

Ready for an action movie with lots of leaping, jumping and hero stuff, it was all of that - but more. It actually had a story line! And it was that story line that kept things moving nicely along.\n\nI think that it's relatively short length (97 minutes) also helped it from being bogged down with minutiae and having a plot that had to be mercilessly stretched beyond its limits. The scenes were crisply photographed, the special effects were enough to give the film its character WITHOUT making it a special-effects movie, per se.\n\nAlthough a little thin in some parts, the dialogue was fair. The only thing I thought might have made it better was the development of some of the peripheral characters.\n\nCharlize Theron is very versatile, and now I fully intend to see the anime of Aeon Flux."

Aeon Flux (2005) is based upon one such show \u0096 a cartoon from the mid-90s \u0096 featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing. Aeon, played by the lovely Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a cold detached rebel who is as dexterous as a line-dancer and as deadly as a viper-snake. She needs to be, if she expects to kick the asses of the totalitarian government.\n\nI love science fiction, but hate the sudden influx of half-assed futuristic dystopian technology-overdosed films like The Island (2005) and Equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the pile). Aeon Flux has all the problems that are present in these films, but amplified. That is, there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the sleek style that Matrix (1999) catalyzed. The special effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux which earns it a few points, but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there.\n\nTo make matters worse, all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch. Charlize Theron's character Aeon Flux is interwoven with the most cheesy tough-chick schtick and it seems as though the director Karyn Kusama cannot quite decide where to go with her next \u0096 should she make her more detached or more emotional? She doesn't know! Let's go both ways! Imagine you take a shotgun, load it chock-full of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux.\n\nThe film Aeon Flux puts forward all the 'mandatory' ideas in a dystopian society - individual vs. society, nature vs. science, emotion vs. cold reason, etc. You've seen all of this before, and better done at that. Go read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even watch Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982)... anything! Avoid this viciously uninvolving cheese-fest for as long as you can.\n\n3/10"

That is not to say that the film is not without its odd gadgets or odd scenes, such as the conversations that Aeon has inside her mind with her boss, or the woman with hands for feet (also featured in the series) but the extent of the \"oddness\" has been greatly diminished. Die-hard fans of the series will notice certain similarities or homages to the shorts and episodes, such as transferring a message in a kiss, or as I mentioned above certain characters, but even so the film does act a stand-alone piece and no prior knowledge is needed to understand or follow the plot.\n\nProbably the film's strongest asset is the plot. To begin with it may seem very similar to the millions of other future-world films out there, but once the plot has been fully revealed it makes for a very interesting film, investigating grounds I have not seen any other films touch upon before. I won't say anymore with regards to the plot as I may give-away something that could ruin it, but let me just say that if you do like this area of cinema and are looking for something a little different, buy it now! Otherwise nothing else in the film is of massive merit or poses any cause-for-concern, the acting is good, the music and sound effects are fine, the stunts are nothing amazingly new, but are adequate and the locales and settings are believable and well-constructed. If it sounds like your sort of film so far then you will find its freshness welcome in a somewhat stagnant pool of dictator/future/sci-fi/post-apocalyptic films. For those who are fans of the series again it is well-worth a look, it doesn't fit in continuity with the series in any place but serves as both a good introduction and final conclusion to the series. And for those people who don't fit into either of the above categories it can serve as gentle introduction to this area of cinema, or however could sour you to any further films of this genre in the future. So I guess for you its your choice good film....!"

However something is wrong and people are disappearing. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) is a mysterious warrior and a member of the rebel group the Monicans. Her beloved sister Una is killed. She feels an unknown connection to Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas). She must uncover a secret conspiracy and the hidden secret of the their world.\n\nThis is a rather dull sci-fi with wooden acting and murky story. The style is pretty interesting but that's all I like about this movie. The movie needs some exposition early on to guide the audience into this world. It holds back too much for the big revelation and the first half is basically lost to confusion especially if you come into the story without prior knowledge. The wooden acting style saps away all the energy and even the action scenes can't save it."

With all the money wasted in FX for this movie, I can't consider it better than many low-budget TV series of the 70's, but what can't really be forgiven of this mess is that the plot is not so bad. It could have led, not, it SHOULD have led to a far batter entertainment than this waste of time only intended to dead-brained, MTV addicted, audience."

Would you fight to overthrow the family that had created and ruled this world for 400 years? Aeon Flux would.\n\nA deadly virus wiped out 99% of the earth's population and the species was only just saved from obliteration by the genius of Dr Goodchild. Fortunately he managed to save a balanced cross section of cultures, races, scientists, and a proliferation of stylists. Together they built the utopian city of Bregna. This is not the dark, post-apocalyptic world of Blade Runner or Mad Max, but a highly stylized, architectural oasis, walled in from chaos and harnessing nature. Everyone and everything is beautiful. But looks can be deceiving. For some reason the population are having bad dreams, they feel strangely empty and some even mysteriously disappear.\n\nAeon Flux is a rebel fighting in the name of the disappeared. She is sent on a mission to assassinate the current leader, Trevor Goodchild, and navigates her way through the labyrinth of government, \"built to be confusing\". While we don't think this film was meant to be confusing, there are lots of beautiful, artistic details which just don't make any sense, other than that they are visually stunning.\n\nCommunication and technology, in this world that is full of action and the possibilities of life in the future, is very organic. The rebels receive their missions from a Handler who they meet by swallowing a pill and entering an internal telepathic space. Surveillance data is collected and reflected in the droplets of water stored in a huge well, and the government buildings are protected by the surrounding foliage, with its missile-filled seed pods and lethal blades of grass.\n\nCharlize Theron is true to the seriously-sexy, sashaying and purring spirit of the animated Aeon, but as she slinks and pouts from one pose to the next in the city she calls a gilded cage, it is difficult to appreciate her desperate loneliness and the determination of her struggle.\n\nFilmed on location in Berlin, the extras include stories from the striking architectural landscapes, such as Hitler's wind tunnel, and some clips from the original MTV animation series."

I got the impression they were still writing the script when they started making the film, because there are so many ideas being thrown around but not one of them is followed, I was lost and bored before the end of the first hour so much so that when they finally unravelled the mystery I really didn't care.\n\nOther people have said its abstract and unique, but it wasn't. This is yet another example of the clich\u00e9-ridden, weakly plotted rubbish made by people with delusions of grandeur."

The original animated series had a very distinct visual style and they have clearly done their best to give the movie an equally vivid visual presence. And I'd say they succeeded. Everything in distant utopia looks great and the film is well worth a watch for the visuals alone.\n\nThe premise is also pretty interesting. A virus has wiped out most of humanity and now only small pockets survive in the middle of wilderness, protected by high walls and the advancement of technology. Yet they must live under a tight regime, and naturally some elements of society are bound to rebel. Our story follows one such rebel, named \u00c6on, who manages to dig deeper into the mystery than anyone before. And thus the stage is set and the play can begin. Great, innovative stuff that allows for a lot of action.\n\nUnfortunately what we end up getting from this setting isn't as great as it could have been. One of the problems is the acting. Charlize Theron is as captivating as ever, but the rest of the cast seem bound by the script and their own limitations. It's a stifling utopia, but does that really have to show in the acting as well.\n\nThe resolution of the story is also somewhat predictable, or at least unimaginative. The downsides of the utopian society are nothing we haven't seen before, the end moral is boring and as a whole I can only wish the story and the themes had matched the visual splendor.\n\n\u00c6on Flux is worth a watch for the fans of the genre. It's gorgeous, action-filled fun, Theron looks amazing in her skimpy dresses and nothing in it is outright bad. Sure, the script could have been better, but on the whole that merely makes it average."

        "review_detailed_main": "How can a guy say no to a movie that has beautiful babe running around using high tech gadget and kung fu killing tons of bad guys, especially doing it in tight tight sexy black outfit? Anyways, that's not the reason I chose to watch this movie. I thought a sci-fi movie directed by a woman may shed new light on the male dominated genre. But unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nProblems I have with this film: Though there's a plot twist, but beside Charlize Theron, who shines regardless how ridiculous the circumstances she was in, the movie was ill casted and failed to elicit emotional response from me.\n\nBack to the plot twist, without spoiling the plot, I have to say that it failed to build up any suspense before it became apparent.\n\nThe environment lacks coherence. This has led me to believe that the director's lack of interests in the subject matter or sci fi/fantasy genre as a whole severely limited her creativity and sensibility in creating a coherent world in which the story unfolds. A world built by a passionate sci-fi fan should not be so boring and disconnected! It's not about neat tricks and special effects, but intricate details that convey the sense of culture existed long before the stories were told. When I think of fantasy master piece, I think of Lord of the ring, I think of Metroid Prime, both offered a world that is not only technically but also architecturally and biologically coherent and faithful to the history and culture of the people and bio-sphere they dwell in. But the world in Aeon Flux made little sense. It seems that the whole movie was shot in some giant concrete sewer system. It lacks believable touches but laden with monolithic concrete structure which lack character and meaning.\n\nI'm not sure if the movie is a direct translation of the animation series or created as a stand alone piece. The story is too far fetched to get any emotional response from me. Also, the movie never bothered to explain how Aeon Flux got to be so powerful. And the custom designs are often incoherent and out of place. While rest of the people dress like normal human being, Aeon dresses like a dominatrix (did I spell it right?). And the old data bank keeper on the huge balloon was dressed up like a giant vegetable in one of those kinder garden shows. Again, it shows that the director has little or no interest in sci-fi/fantasy genre and hardly has any judgement in the subject matter.\n\nYeah, it is a sci-fi movie charged with emotion, but the emotion didn't get translated well. I thought equilibrium is a much better movie with similar premise.\n\nUltimately, I sense that it's the story that interested the director, not the media. But without coherent media, how do you expect people to take the story seriously?"

        "review_detailed_main": "'Aeon Flux is the worst movie ever made.' So said pretty much every critic back in 2005 when it was first released. Therefore it bombed and was pretty much forgotten about. Yes, it's hardly going to be mentioned in the same breath as 'The Godfather' and 'Empire Strikes Back,' but it's definitely not as bad as many made out and you can get some enjoyment out of it... if you're in the right mindset.\n\nIt was based on some sort of MTV show (I didn't watch it) about a futuristic society that has survived the apocalypse and is now living under a - borderline fascist - regime in the last city on Earth. However, those nasties in charge are constantly being harassed by a band of resistance fighters, including Charlize Theron's 'Aeon Flux' - who is a lycra-clad assassin who may just win the war for the good guys.\n\nThere's the typical futuristic city setting, which isn't bad - even the computer-generated moments are just about passible. Then you have the action and the shootouts etc that are associated with the genre. So what went wrong? Rumour has it the film was supposed to be much longer and was majorly trimmed down in the edit suite to a more fast-paced hour and thirty-one minutes. Sadly, this appeared to take with it many of the slower moments which helped explain what was going on and the film's biggest criticism is that it's a bit of a mess for losing this extra footage.\n\nBelieve it or not, 'Aeon Flux' isn't just about getting Charlize Theron in lycra. The movie does deal with a few interesting and weighty concepts. However, they could probably have been fleshed-out far more than the enforced run-time has allowed.\n\nIf you're expecting Theron to turn in a performance that rivals her Oscar-winning turn in 'Monster' then you're way off. Here, she just plays the typical tough girl who just so happens to be stunningly attractive. She's functional in what she does as gives the best she can under the circumstances. The rest of the cast can also be best described as 'functional.' However, despite its flaws, I still can't bring myself to hate it. Yes, it's no masterpiece, but if you're in the mood to simply sit down and watch Charlize gun her way through plenty of henchmen in a futuristic setting and you don't want to think too deeply about the hows and whys of it all, then look no further. Just don't ask me what's the deal with the 'merged' A and E of the title. Is that even a letter?"

I feel Theron took the role for the $$\n\nSecond... one of my favorite things about the actual series not the shorts were the monologues of Trevor's giving him method to his madness and the metaphors that lied within the series itself not to mention the sexual tension of Aeon who was a actual Dominatrix in the series and Trevor... a cat and mouse game of tease tag if you will they both had power just in different facets and Chung really played with that idea in a genius way if you ask me\n\nthis film is utter spoon-fed trite digestible for the \"Matrix\" generation\n\nAdding proper names to characters does not justify completely rewriting and abusing a series of exceptional quality the likes that come along once in a blue moon in the watered down age\n\n/rant"

I should point out that I never saw the animated version, and so I'm left to judge this film only on its own merits, not as a comparison to the MTV thing that preceded it.\n\nThe movie was better than I expected, and quite enjoyable. Obviously, they have an advantage in getting people's attention due to Theron's looks and costumes, and the fantastic (I mean that literally) stunt sequences. But I found myself drawn into the story line, too. It had a very cyberpunk feel to it, and now that I've digested the film a bit, I think one reason I liked it is that it looked a lot like how I imagined early William Gibson novels to look. I guess that makes sense, given that the original MTV Aeon Flux came out when cyberpunk was still cool.\n\nBut I'm always a sucker for the \"society and Earth has melted down, and all that's left is this little bubble\" type of sci-fi story. Maybe it goes back to my love of Logan's Run as a child.\n\nThe visuals were great, the music was good, and the acting was way better than any sci-fi movie I've seen in the past couple years. Speaking of acting, I had a suspicion after watching the first hour of the film that the cast were mainly British actors with American accents. A check through IMDb proved me right. Even though everyone sounded like they could have grown up in St. Louis, all the 6 or 7 top billed actors were born outside the US except Frances McDormand - 1 from New Zealand, 1 from South Africa, and the rest from the UK.\n\nAnyhow, I'm rating the film 7 out 10. It's well constructed, beautiful, and very entertaining."

I think that the main contribution of this movie was the demonstration of some interesting outfits for women.

My problems with this movie was the lack of story and character motivation, the twisted characters (i.e. Una being her sister)and why does the black girl have to have monkey paws instead of regular feet. Also it borrows way too much from Logan's run, star wars, and the matrix. Here are things that it really did incorrectly, Aeon never had a partner, Trevor's hair is platinum not dull brown, her boss isn't carrot-top's mother, there was never any cloning crap, there 2 cities that were called Bregna and Monica, and what happened to all the weird and obscure creatures and devices that supposedly exist in the future, the soldiers were retarded, Aeon barely used a gun, and worst of all Aeon didn't die at the end. Charlize Theron tried her best, but should just stick to playing lesbian serial killers instead of doing crappy chick flicks like Halley berry in cat woman. at least there is one chick flick to look forward to: wonder woman, another piece of wasted talent that Hollywood cant wait to plug into theaters."

It was created by Korean American animator Peter Chung for the big screen and stars Charlize Theron as AEON (changed from the Latin \u00c6on).\n\nWe all know we are headed for a catastrophic end of the world, and by 2415 a few million humans are left on earth in a little spot of paradise called Bregna. (the devout likely have departed in the \"rapture\") But as always there is trouble in paradise. Many Bregnan's \"disappear\" much as they did in Argentina in the last century. The government leaders constantly surveil the populace and something our current government would like, inn 2415, they apparently don't need a court order. Rebels living in Bregna, known as Monicans are working for freedom. Enter Aeon Flux, a more gymnastic and shapely James Bond of the future who is neither shaken nor stirred as completes her missions for the Monicans.\n\nThis is a bit tongue in cheek, and this movie is after all based on a cartoon. But it is very entertaining with well thought out special effects. Charlize Theron and her body double are eye candy for the adolescent and older male audience. They knew what they were doing when they went for a PG 13 rating! But as neither an adolescent nor male, I also enjoyed the film, the sci-fi genre which is so rare these days. I think you will too."

        "review_detailed_main": "I personally have no tolerance for run-of-the-mill, predictable Hollywood movies that are saturated with clich\u00e9s, so inevitably this movie received only one star from me. If you like all of the aforementioned qualities than by all means, see the movie.\n\nNow, two things. One, I have not seen the animated series. Two, I could hardly bring myself to finish the movie. My mom bought it, knowing that I love action films. For her sake I've tried watching it four different times and it has never failed to make me wince in embarrassment. The first three times it found itself back in its case before an hour had passed.\n\nThe things I liked about this movie? You could practically taste the potential on your the tip of your tongue. I would prefer to watch a bit of the movie and then imagine how great the ending will be, and try to forget my utter disappointment. There were three things that contributed to my dislike for the film: characters, setting, and plot.\n\nFirst, the characters. They were dull and underdeveloped for two reasons; they were written poorly and the actors, for the most part, were wooden and unconvincing. Goodchild is not much of a villain after his statement \"But...it's wrong!\" The real villain, as the viewer will soon find out, looks like someone who spent the better part of his life in a basement singing lullabies and crying himself to sleep. The redheaded lady can be described as nothing less than creepy and everyone else seems to just be convenient extras with the exception of our heroine, Aeon Flux, who leads the typical Hollywood double-life; on one hand she can be very emotional and sickeningly sensitive but in others looked like she could have slaughtered a classroom of kids and would simply brush it off as an unfortunate incident.Oh, and that scarf Theron wore to bed? I don't see the purpose of her even putting it on, she could have just slapped silly putty to her chest and other areas and called it a night. Same effect.\n\nNow for the setting. The first few scenes were people walking down a street, etc, and then here comes Theron in her tight black leather costume, being \"completely inconspicuous\" among everyone else who's dressed as if it's still 2006. You'd think that for the last place on earth it would be more run-down but apparently not. They have everything you could possibly think of...or so it seems. We don't really get a real idea of the technology they have. They have flying machines, coconut-things that shoot spike-things, blades of grass that are actually grass-looking blades...but then people still need to prepare food manually, fashion hasn't changed, and as another user pointed out, houses are not what you'd expect from a futuristic location but have the comfortable greens and browns that tell of an era already passed. But THEN, you have teleporters and...I don't know. I'm getting confused just thinking about it.\n\nSpeaking of confusing, The plot fluctuates between the aforementioned quality, predictable, and just plain stupid. When the movie started I was confused, even with the help of the cheesy narrative. The good guys were bad guys, the bad guys were good and bad guys, and there was a varying level of ignorance in almost every character. Some people have claimed that there are amazing plot twists, but you know a twist isn't a twist when you saw it coming from a mile away. Besides that, it's a \"i am hartles but not really!! look, here, want a clich\u00e9 lol\" movie and should have been scrapped.\n\nI don't know what else to say about this film. The actors were irritating, the setting was unconvincing, and the plot was laughable. Thank you Hollywood for providing us with the chance to see an hour and a half of undiluted, unmitigated crap.\n\nDon't see this movie."

Oh wait, it also may be the only one...;)\n\nWhile any review of this movie that didn't mention the inspiration would be remiss, it should be noted that Aeon Flux not only stands well on it's own, but leaps and bounds as an eclectic sci-fi tale that just happens to feature a beautiful lead actress in skin-tight outfits laying waste to suckers by the dozen.\n\nAeon Flux began as a component of MTV's \"Liquid Television\" animation showcase, where Peter Chung's drastically drawn heroine would zip across infiltrated compounds accompanied solely by the sound of rhythmic footfalls and gunfire, leaving a gory trail of slain soldiers only to meet a gory end herself. The short merited expansion into a series that added a host of profound characters and plot lines, not to mention some well-acted dialog. I was never able to catch the series in sequence, but never felt much of a need to, as the \"what the hell is going on here?\" feeling that I got from each episode greatly contributed to an overall feeling of \"I don't really know, but it's awesome!\".\n\nCerebral. Dynamic. Trippy. Sexy. Words that come to mind to describe the Aeon Flux flavor. I was highly doubtful that any film version could do justice to the original animation, but this movie delivered quite nicely in it's own way. The pleasant disorientation of the series remains to a degree, but the movie is also able to backfill the story behind Trevor and Aeon in a satisfying manner without dumbing down Peter Chung's unique and panoramic bio- nanotechnological science fiction.\n\nI also wasn't sold on the idea of Charlize Theron as lethal-lightning agent Aeon Flux when I first heard she had the part, but once again, Miss Theron demonstrates her versatility and power as an actress, leaving me thinking that no one else could have played the role as well. Charlize took what could have been a hollow, eye-candy-only part and added a sublime depth while bringing the angular, scantily-clad \"woman of few words\" to life. Any number of hot actresses could have filled out the skimpy digs, but Charlize is able to provide the essential intrigue as well as the splendiferous ass. Add \"Action Heroine\" to Charlize Theron's already formidable repertoire.\n\nMarton Csokas did a great job of capturing the odd ambiguity of Trevor Goodchild. The supporting cast all performed to par and beyond, with the end result being a memorable post-apocalyptic pseudo-utopian action cyberpunk romance. Say that five times fast! ;)\n\nOf course there will be purists who beef about this or that not being true to whatever part of the original series, and of course there will be sanctimonious \"critics\" who make droll comparisons to Catwoman, but I feel that the Aeon Flux movie certainly accomplishes a potent and complimentary mix of visual and mental stimulation, and anyone who likes that sort of thing should go see this movie."

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Aeon Flux",
        "review_detailed_main": "For the uninitiated, Aeon Flux is based on the series of animated shorts from MTV. Set 400 years into the future, it tells of a surviving utopia of humans after a virus eradicated 99% of the world's human population. The colony now live in a walled environment, under the leadership of the scientist who discovered the cure for the virus.\n\nBut with any kind of leadership rule with some hinting of hanky-panky behind the scenes, there will always be that bunch of rebels (like Star Wars, Matrix, etc) ever ready to upset the status quo. Here, the Monicans (as they are known) are avenging those who have disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and like James Bond, have cool toys to accompany them on missions. Charlize Theron plays the Monican's top assassin known as Aeon Flux.\n\nAnd she is just about the best thing in the movie. Full of close ups on that pretty face, and long shots of those incredibly long limbs, Theron waltzes her way through the film with ease, given the character's sheer invulnerability and ability to subdue any opponent without breaking into sweat. She does a few wardrobe changes too (drool), and her hair, now jet black, styled ever so beautifully at all times when she's kicking ass.\n\nThe movie rehashes the usual sci-fi themes that have been beaten time and again, that of mortality, and the morality behind immortality. Probably I haven't watched the MTV shorts to understand more of Aeon Flux, but as a standalone movie, you sort of guessed its the usual \"bad-to-clone-humans\" storyline about one-third into the movie. By the time you're half way through, you would have guessed what's next on the agenda, and how it'll end.\n\nOne sore point about Aeon Flux is the lack of a credible, strong villain. The baddies kinda lacked focus with its internal bitching, and double-crossing / switching sides so often, they make villains look so embarrassingly fickle minded about their cause. Most of the time though you'll only see lots of foot soldiers in ugly uniforms, dispatched like bowling pins. Also, I felt that the filmmakers sort of changed their minds about the ending - quite clear what had happened, and quite amazed at what happened thereafter (Not wanting to spoil, just look out for a character).\n\nGiven the film's length (approx 90 minutes without end credits), very little is said about the abilities of the Monicans, except they make excellent assassins (or at least Aeon is), with abilities that can be enhanced by changing some body (spare) parts. The cool thing that they have is the telepathy amongst the agents, as well as their Handler. Kiss goodbye to meeting rooms, where you can have ultra-cool meetings in your cerebral cortex instead.\n\nAnd that's where the special effects struck gold. Other than that, and the teleportation effects, for a movie set in the future, it looked relatively low-budgeted, if compared to contemporary sci-fi peers of recent times.\n\nOne surprise I got was Pete Postlethwaite's appearance as the Keeper - I thought he looked quite funny in his costume, although his underused character played a pivotal role in the events that unfold.\n\nSo except for hardcore Aeon fans, or admirers of Theron, this film could prove to be unappealing given its relatively weak sci-fi story as the backbone. Ooh, I must rave again, Theron looks absolutely gorgeous with her uber-chic hairdo and slinky black lycra."

Maybe Charlize Theron's mother needed an operation or something. This is brainless sci-fi, a puffed-up issue movie that ultimately offers nothing but regret. Don't be so bent on getting value for your $10 investment - sometimes, like here, there is nothing to champion, nothing to justify.

The women are sterile, and the population is cloned living many lives. A resistance group entitled Monicans and led by The Handler (Frances McDormand), assigns the assassin Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) to kill Trevor and overthrow the government. However, Aeon Flux discloses a scheme plotted by Oren Goodchild (Jonny Lee Miller) against his brother Trevor and she resolves to protect Trevor instead of killing him.\n\n\"Aeon Flux\" is a reasonable sci-fi adventure with names such as Frances McDormand, Charlize Theron and Pete Postlethwaite in the cast. The action scenes have too many cuts and most of them are badly edited and there is the traditional exaggeration of shootings. Further, there are points that are not clear for those like me that are not familiarized with this character, such as why the Monicans wants to overthrow and kill Trevor. In the end, the viewer can see that Utopia will never exist; on the contrary, there will be always discontents no matter how perfect a society may be. But in general, this movie entertains without being special. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Aeon Flux\""

No matter what you loved about it...\n\nThe Aeon Flux film of late 2005 has nothing of that.\n\nKaryn Kusama, the so called \"director\" of the film, was hopelessly over-strained with transporting the original content to a new film. If you 're not familiar with the original series, you won't understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the film.The story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the film.\n\nKusama's attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a storyteller , it's simply unworthy of the original \u00c6ON concept.\n\nCharlize Theron might be an attractive woman, but she can't impersonate the \u00c6ON character. Although she was attached to strings doing action scenes, her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film. The result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physique.\n\nForget about all the rest, it's not worth talking about...\n\nI give 1point for Ms.Theron showing her boobs and 1point for the nice architectural photography in the film.

Peter Chung pulled this off masterfully and probably has much more to do with the genre we call smart, action-thrillers than he's given credit for.

Aeon Flux 2005 doesn't even acknowledge this and instead stumbles through a tedious array of clich\u00e9 plot devices and an all-too-familiar network iconographic observations on man's relationship with nature.\n\n*Nature is more powerful than man* Woo!

What I need to point out though is that the movie suffers from something I like to call \"script convenience packaging\".\n\nThis is an affliction which occurs when characters, events and motivations alter to suit the running story-line. For example, when characters are one place and suddenly pop into another, or when a person is struck down by bullets, struggling to move, and then running about in the very same scene.\n\nThe design of the sets and the people were awkward, particularly since it was only the main characters that had unique costumes, while all the background people were dressed semi-normally, despite the fact that the movie takes place 400 years from now.

When Aeon is sent to to kill the governmental leader, she realises that not everything it what it seems and begins to piece together the truth.\n\nPacked with excellent fight sequences, intrigue and an animation/Sci-Fi Ora. The origins of this movie are very apparent, and although I cannot comment on comparisons with Peter Chung's animated series; having never seen it, for me Aeon Flux is a visually impressive action feast with plenty of thought-provoking substance and an interesting storyline. And I must add that Charlise Theron gives an outstanding performance, given the complexity of her character and the physical demands of the role; she delivers perfectly and simply oozes sex appeal.\n\nAlthough not for everyone, Aeon Flux is very stylish and really does entertain.\n\n7/10"

Her brief performance is embarrassing to her strength as a strong supporting character actor.."

She should be doing more movies, and yet, she's on the sidelines, in term of hot directors. Why? A Hollywood extravaganza of a sci-fi romantic epic that meets any expectations for the uncritical. My wife loved it, and thought it was opulent, very psychedelic and totally gripping right up to the end. I have, and know the original, but if you believe that reading a book is different than seeing a film of that book, or if you believe one version of a vision, called the original, doesn't have to be re-cloned into another same reality (like the plot of this film, Aeonflux fans, don't you get it, the original is never remade... without losing something. Hey, this is the worst film to bitch about not making it the same. The whole plot is about that very question... the clone is not enough... OK, whatever. We are still all originals. Films are not. Especially remakes. But simply, if you are a lover of Charlize Theron, her lips, her mouth, her eyes and her body, then sit back and enjoy. The scenery in this film is awesome. The special effects are awesome, if you like Euro and Brazilian modern... hey, Pete Postlethwaite is there, in a ghostly homage to himself as actor and embodied spirit of the authentic keeper of human offspring. Just dig it. The music is great, and very inventive at times. Great work, Graeme Revell. This is a fine movie to enjoy, extremely well made and directed, and serve it up, if you like double features, with either (OK, my choices) The Tenth Victim, or a decade or two more currently, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. Or much more currently, the Hunger Games."

Only 30%-40% attendance, not very promising.\n\nMy heart sank further when I saw \"MTV Film Productions\" in the opening credits.\n\nMy worst fears were realised when the film went through an extended 1-hour long MTV sequence of plodding contrived dialogue delivered in a monotone, meaningless action sequences, and \"creative\" camera shots.\n\nIt was only until the last 15 minutes of the show that we realise what the show was all about. Even so, the climax got a \"ok... so that's it?\" reaction from the audience.\n\nThe basic premise is actually quite good and provides lots of room for exploration. Unfortunately, this film never got around to it. Somehow, the director contrived to make an action film feel agonisingly slow-paced.\n\nThis show just scrapes a passing 5 stars, thanks to Charlize Theron's fantastic figure."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I hope the movie's better than the animated MTV series,\" my cousin scoffed as the opening credits played. Since I had never seen the Aeon Flux short films (and I dare not judge them) I inquired, \"Was it not very good?\" \"No,\" my cousin informed me.\n\nThe fact that my cousin was asleep within 10 minutes tipped me off that he was as unimpressed with the movie as he was the original series. I shouldn't be too surprised. It's usually not a positive sign when a movie's only nationwide screenings are 10:00 PM the night before its release and press aren't officially invited. I suppose it's a good strategy in one sense - lull people to sleep at this late hour and then they can't, in good conscience, ridicule what they weren't awake to see.\n\nHolding out hope that the movie would at least be mindless entertainment, I assumed the studio knew the critics had their pun guns loaded and were ready to fire off such headlines as ... wait for it ...\n\n\"Aeon Flux? More like Aeon Sux!\"\n\nTherefore, I gave Paramount the benefit of the doubt. \"Ah, this is just a case of the studio saying they don't care what the critics think,\" I said to myself, trying to remain positive. \"They're only concerned with how much the movie will entertain regular moviegoers. This is a movie for the people, not the stuffed-shirt critics!\" How naive I was.\n\nNow I'm not demanding the second coming of Star Wars whenever a new sci-fi film is released, but does it hurt to do *something* to stand out from the pack? Earning the title of \"2005's Most Generic Sci-Fi\" does not count. Uninspired acting, a lack of an imaginative story, no strong villain to root against, weakly-rendered CGI, and a pace that my dead pet turtle could keep up with aren't my ideal ingredients for a fun night at the theater. Sure, Charlize looks really good sashaying in her black outfit, but look where Halle Berry's ability to look smokin' hot in black leather got Catwoman.\n\nSpeaking of the unimaginative story, I'm starting to feel a little guilty.\n\n\"About what? Being so hard on Aeon Flux?\"\n\nNo, about my detailed plot description. Allow me to apologize. Reading my synopsis, you may be misled to believe that the story is fairly intriguing. Admittedly, on paper the story looks to have promise, but the paper is where the promise stays.\n\nFor example, you remember those secrets that my synopsis said Aeon would uncover? Sounds interesting, right? Ooooh, deadly secrets will be revealed! Bring on the tense plot twists! If only. The most novice of sci-fi fans will have the basics figured out within the first 10 minutes. Let me put it bluntly: Aeon wants to kill Trevor Goodchild, she figures out that something's fishy, Trevor has a brother (Miller), and we immediately see them at odds. Care to guess how this will pan out?\n\n\"Well, at least there was a lot of cool, fast-paced action and mesmerizing special effects, right?\"\n\nI wish. That's what shocks me most. I figured, \"OK, I'll go ahead and assume I won't get much in regard to story and character development. But at least the effects should impress.\" If you've seen the trailer where Charlize barely stops herself from falling in the blades of grass then you've seen about the best the movie has to offer in the effects department. That's not high praise. Everything else consists of Aeon showing off her mad acrobatic skills. Whenever you see her jump you can take it to the bank that a flip will be incorporated, and you can guarantee that the flip will serve no useful purpose.\n\nThe gunfights are of the \"Charlize stands in one spot, turns around, shoots a bunch of guys, but doesn't get hurt\" variety, while the hand-to-hand combat is an extra mild \"show extreme close-ups so people can't tell that Charlize doesn't know how to fight\" flavor. But the action sequences are only inserted whenever the director decides it's a good idea to break away from long \"Charlize slowly walking around looking at stuff\" sequences.\n\nAnd if the slow pace isn't enough to make you regret shelling out hard-earned dollars for this ticket, then I have a feeling the trite dialogue will force you to analyze future movie choices more carefully. We're treated to such deliciously uninspired lines as \"I'd keep off the grass,\" \"I like my shoes,\" and \"I've been your brother for a long time.\" The actors deliver these lines with such a void of emotion that it's obvious they know the lines aren't worthy of even a little mock passion.\n\nI'm all for superhero films with a strong female lead, mainly because I love watching hot chicks wearing cool outfits and kicking Kirstie Alley-sized buttocks. In my opinion, Kate Beckinsale in Underworld has set the modern day standard. So I was actually looking forward to Aeon Flux (surely you can't go wrong with Charlize Theron, right?). Unfortunately, its mediocrity falls somewhere between the levels set by Catwoman and Elektra, and it'll simply be known as another action/superhero movie that couldn't be saved merely because it boasts a sexy lead.\n\nAs for my napping cousin? When he awoke and noticed the closing credits were scrolling he asked (and you may wonder the same thing if you decide to skip it), \"What did I miss?\" The most passionate answer I could come up with was, \"Not much.\""

However, it is not a good film.\n\nAs the title indicates, I have issues with this Hollywood trend of hiring good looking people, passing over talented people. Charlize Theron, at least, isn't a Ham actress; there are hardly any clumsily performed scenes. She avoids this by not trying to act.\n\nWhat little plot there is, is predicated on a post-apocalyptic society. Obviously this lends itself towards social comment. This is, at best blunt. And at worst, see-through. There are no really viable comments made. Having said that, the story-line is moderately complex. There is a reason for this: The film takes on twists, Special Effects, Violence, Futuristic Gadgets and Eye Candy to disguise, make that attempt to disguise, the vacuity at its core.\n\nI wouldn't see it again, even for free.

Was the decision to build Bregna and maintain its population, while withholding critical information, ethical or scientifically justified? Was the power play between the Goodchild brothers inevitable? Was the leadership of the Goodchilds (to which the Monicans are rebelling) responsive to the needs of the people? Would a population ever accept the societal structure of Bregna? To me, Aeon Flux simply raises too many interesting questions about how humanity deals with crises and the roles of leaders and rebellions to dismiss as just a B Sci-Fi movie. Something about the film continues to capture my interest, even after watching all the Peter Chung animated shorts, which really seem only loosely related."

In the Sci-Fi world, it's a step up from Minority Report or I-Robot.\n\nMy interpretation of the negative reviews: that stuffy old white men who write the reviews (Ebert, etc) don't understand edgy movies. They didn't understand Matrix at first, either.\n\nI didn't know there was a series before I saw the movie. People who say it didn't make sense at first are too used to brainless Hollywood flicks, serving you a formulaic plot on a platter.\n\nThis plot was not difficult to understand - the movie asks for your patience the first 30 minutes, as the story unfolds. It's a futuristic mystery, people! Get real - how lazy must you be if you lose interest because everything isn't explained immediately. It's a mildly (and pleasantly) complex story. If you want a Steven Siegal or Schwarzenegger action flick, look elsewhere.\n\nAnd only the first half of the movie is the \"mystery\". It takes about an hour for the plot, the characters, and the futuristic setting to unfold. Then the movie evolves into a stunning action flick.\n\nThing I loved about this movie:\n\n-Srong female characters -Excellent soundtrack -Extremely interesting visually -Extremely creative sci-fi contributions (like the arm-to-leg transplants) -Thoughtful cinematography -A very strong cast -Artistic sets & effects -Creative weapons & futuristic props -A truly unique story - it didn't try to copy anything (which probably confused the Hollywood lemmings out there)\n\nMy only complaint - it needed more in spots. Particularly, more character development for other members of the resistance. If you've seen it...I believe they jumped the gun getting to the last \"sniper\" scene. I wanted them to invest more time developing the animosity between Aeon Flux & the resistance movement.\n\nNonetheless, I'm hoping for a sequel. And I hope Ms Theron doesn't get depressed about some of the bad reviews. This is *nothing* like Catwoman (as Ebert said). My humble prediction: it will turn into a cult classic."

I DID want to see.\n\nI always liked the animated shorts on MTV's Liquid TV. They were different, not the standard drivel. I checked the reviews and IMDb score and saw this movie wasn't rated well (mid-5). So I was taking a chance.\n\nBesides having an interesting plot or decent acting, I can tell a good movie by the way I feel when I walk out. I had to wander through the mall after this movie, and I was in a good mood. Uplifted. It's hard to describe, but you probably know the feeling. All the women I passed were attractive (whether they were pretty or not) and I noticed all the children ambling around were precious. My appreciation for life and happiness were raised, if only for a few hours.\n\nOther people have commented on the scenery, the backgrounds, and such. How drab the people look and how bland the buildings are, etc. Some have said the hair styles were too weird. I say - whatever. I am not primarily interested in the set. If you want wacky scenery, go rent The Fifth Element or if you want dreary future scenery get Blade Runner - both decent (or better) films. I am interested in the character development and the story. Would this movie have been much better if they spent $30 million on CGI backgrounds or exotic costumes? Not really. Remember the series often had a similar utilitarian look - and that look serves the story as an emotional backdrop in certain ways. So I discount those criticisms.\n\nNow, I admit I don't like a lot of the movies aimed at teenagers. I don't like a lot of gratuitous violence or sex if the story doesn't call for it. This movie didn't overdo it, it was more subtle than that. It generally focuses on what serves the story. Refreshing in that way.\n\nI see the demographics have a lot of votes for 10 (20%) and a lot of votes of 1 (13%). '1' votes are unfair in my opinion. There is no way this is the worst movie ever set to film. Obvious attempts to tank a score. But I understand how maybe some people did not care for the film - it ISN'T standard Hollywood formula junk. No car chases or anything! No over-hyped drawn out sex scenes! Not mindless entertainment! Wait, that's what I liked about it.\n\nThis movie deserves to be a high 6. It was much better than the other movies I've seen rated mid-5 here on IMDb. Those generally leave me feeling poorer by $10-20 and not uplifted at all. It may be 'low budget' and it may be 'different' but it is worth seeing on the big screen, especially if you enjoyed the series at all."

The costumes were fun ( if impractical) and some of the set designs were absolutely gorgeous.It's a shame that all that's good about this movie.\n\nAeon flux was a very edgy offensive sexually charged cartoon several years ago. This was Aeon Flux in Disneyland. A rehashed plot about a rebel group fighting a totalitarian government harboring a secret that could cripple the Utopian society. Been there... done that... about a million times, and this film adds nothing new to the formula, except a few more plot holes. A city of maybe 4000 people is recycled for 400 years and no one notices, I guess they were distracted by the couture designs. It's amazing how many varied fabrics you can get in an isolated \"last\" city on earth.\n\nThe action sequences are choppy, some of the special effects are unconvincing, and the fake twists and turns in the plot seem like afterthoughts. They should have went full tilt on Aeon. Made her edgier, more cut-throat, and more interesting. Instead we get \"catwoman 2:into the future\" There is a scene where some vital liquid technology is flushed down a drain...seems like the film pretty much followed."

I delayed and it left the theaters before I saw it. I was not overly upset since I had heard so much negative. Then I was excited about seeing Ultraviolet and it was awful so I figured I had really done good by missing Aeon Flux in the theaters but I remained curious.\n\nIt came out on DVD and I made a point to see it the day it came out. My 15 year old daughter watched it with me. The plot was a little odd but we could both follow it. I am a huge Sci-fi fan, she is only passingly interested in it so I figure that must mean that the plot is okay. That is a good word for this movie - okay. The action is okay, not outstanding but not awful. The special effects are okay. The progress of technology is okay. The explanation of the characters and their backstory is okay.\n\nThe basics are that in 2011, a virus kills 99% of the population before a Dr. Goodchild discovers a vaccine and is able to save the rest. He creates a walled utopian society and the movie is now 400 years later. There is a group which opposes him called the Monicans (though that name is never explained and that bugged me). That is the most I can say without giving away too much of the plot but the movie does a good job of following its premise (unlike Ultraviolet). It stuck with its story and did not sidetracked so I appreciated that.\n\nThis is not a must-see movie but I am glad I saw it. It was pleasant enough and was not a total waste of time and money. Maybe on the big screen of a theater, it came across better or worse but if you are in a sci-fi mood, you could do much worse than this movie."

In the Animated series, while Flux was a \"good guy\", she was also very narcissistic, vindictive, manipulative, sarcastic and had a way sexier presence than her movie version, over all she was a bitch. (this isn't to say that Charlize Theron didn't play a good part, I blame the script writers for her character f**k up) Also in the series, Trevor Goodchild is a bastard and is manipulative and narcissistic himself but he also has a bit of a soft side,if you have seen the animated series but still want to see the movie go for it, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are a big fan of the series because you will be sorely disappointed..

And they really made Charlize Theron wear some of Aeon Flux' silly outfits.\n\nThe major weakness in my opinion is the level of seriousness the movie tries to keep. It just doesn't work. They either should have thrown in a little humor or deviate more from the comic. But being as it is, the movie got a bit slow at times. At least it is not expected for you to know the comic series.\n\nGo and give this movie a try. Honestly, it's not as bad as many people say.

I didn't feel cheated in the way I was with, for instance, \"John Q\" (the political advertisement ghost written by Hillary Clinton which I was forced to pay to see and which forever barred me from Denzel's movies on principle).\n\nThe story hasn't been told before, the world hasn't been seen, the pacing is consistent, although slower than we expect for an action film (which Aeon Flux the animation was not primarily), and the special effects equal to today's standards. As eye candy, it certainly delivers.\n\nI leave the \"bad\" items to the many negative reviews already here, which are mostly technical.\n\nHowever... the worst is that a chance to establish another great franchise was tragically missed. The fact that a major motion picture starring two Academy Award winners was made based on a handful of experimental cartoons that virtually no one saw is evidence of the opportunity.\n\nAeon Flux as created by Peter Chung achieved near cult status via a few late-night showings on MTV's \"Liquid Television\" in the early 1990's. That program may have represented the last gasp of the soul of MTV, now the Wal-Mart of teenage culture, complete with taking no chances at violating marketing results. One irony of Aeon Flux the film is MTV's logo in front of its own story (to avoid spoilers, I'll let you figure that one out, but suffice to say they are the bad guy, not the good guy).\n\nWhich brings us to the sadness: The good guys and bad guys. Which are obvious and formulaic--and not what Peter Chung created. Theron and Csokas as Aeon and Trevor, whether forced by the script or from lack of imagination, are not at all, in any way, by any stretch, the characters created by Chung. And Aeon Flux the animation drew interest and accolades almost entirely on those characters.\n\nThe success of the original Aeon Flux was based 25% on its ambiguousness and 75% on the personalities of its lead characters (though less as the series neared its end--again due primarily to lack of imagination and, sorry, simply balls on MTV's part).\n\nAeon and Trevor fascinate us specifically for their refusal to be driven by external purposes. Their stout resistance to the falsity of altruistic intentions and their adherence to their own ethic and interests is fresh and exciting, demonstrating what it would be like to be truly free of cultural and political hypnotism.\n\nIn the apparent darkest of times, they are the lightest of personal characters, with a spirit of play unachievable by those beholden to history, education and the machine of civilization.\n\nThe skill of adaptation is to capture essence. To recreate the emotional and intellectual response of the original in a new medium, regardless of physical trappings--witnessed by successful adaptations set in entirely different settings and circumstances.\n\nAll that was necessary to make Aeon Flux the film into a classic was to capture Aeon and Trevor's essence and deliver it, but no one associated with this film was interested in doing that."

I could have excused the poor casting of the lead. I could have excused the heavy handed direction and the writing. I could have excused almost anything bad about this film if it just had the quirkiness and strangeness that the original series had.\n\nDon't look for oddly clever turns of common phrases from the original series (\"That which doesn't kill us makes us stranger.\")\n\nDon't look for the odd and bizarre contraptions of the future.\n\nDon't look for the irony.\n\nDon't look for the very cool stuff from the animated series that the filmmakers chose to not exploit in making this film.\n\nIt's boring and it is forgettable."

Somehow the directing and the posing softened the new Aeon character too much. Looks like Charlize was not given much range and appeared to be reigned in as to not overshadow her fellow actors.\n\nCasting is good enough, costume design and effects are very acceptable while not outstanding. Dialog on par with the range this movie allows. The fight scenes are entertaining but sometimes a bit predictable.\n\nDie hard fans of Aeon: don't expect much, die hard fans of Charlize: don't expect a great performance.\n\nIf you seek to be entertained and do not mind a bit fluff in your action, go see it.

Aeon Flux is suppose to die at the end and she's mysteriously in the next one.\n\nWhat was great about the cartoon is that it was bizarre. They captured NONE of this in the movie. I mean...hell...the first episode had no intelligible dialogue, but it had this scantly clad chick killing a bunch of guards to get to this one guy. And then she dies. The problem with the movie is that they try to explain the story. The cartoon never made sense. People talked and you had NO clue what they were talking about.\n\nApart from not being close to the cartoon, it was horrible. I went with three friends that hadn't seen any of it and they hated it just as much as I did. The plot was overused, the characters were stupid, the \"futuristic\" world was bland and has been used so many times. (Can we have something new, please?) The clothing wasn't too terribly bad. Actually, the clothing and hair style was an improvement from the cartoon, but that's about it. There's a monkey in this one part. I bet he was the writer.\n\nHere's the plan: Get the cartoon on DVD and watch that or if you want to go see something in theaters, Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe comes out next week."

Special effects are good, Charlize looks beautiful, but not her best, I believe, and the storyline exists... barely.\n\nAnyway, compared with the animated series, it's a complete sham. Even if I didn't understand most of what happened in the series, the little that I did understand shames this pitiful attempt of a script. Except the names of the heroes and some of the outfits there is nothing in common between the animation and the film.\n\nThe end is ridiculous and not even worth watching. there are some nice technologies and ideas scattered throughout the movie, but they hardly warrant a view. If you had your doubts about seeing this film or not, choose not to see it. If you are hot for Charlize, then I can't really comment on THAT :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Did you ever wish lycra-clad kick-boxing heroines could be a little more life like? How about a storyline where you lost the one you love with the hope of finding them 400 years (and many incarnations) in the future? Aeon Flux is a healthy dose of sci-fi fantasy for those who enjoy such things, distinct from Lara Croft or Matrix -type heroines (though you could also say derived from them if you are cynically non-futurist in your film tastes).\n\nThe multi-faceted Charlize Theron extends her athletic and ballerina skills to perform her own stunts in this beautifully realised (if fairly simplistic) tale of underground fighters (The Monicans) that are seeking to overthrow a dictatorship that is not always as benevolent as it would seem. After a deadly virus has struck down 99% of the world's population, the last surviving humans have been secretly cloned for many generations and exist in a seemingly perfect society. But people go missing. Monican Theron is given the mission to assassinate the leader but, as she penetrates the inner sanctums, she also penetrates plot layers revealing it to be far from a straightforward battle.\n\nWhat makes Theron stand out is that she is very much all woman. Previous female superheroes have been masculine or androgynous ciphers played by a female lead in manga-like, sexless action sequences that reduce them almost to mindless puppets. Our heroine in Aeon Flux, in between high-tech fighting scenes, is unafraid to show subtle shades of emotion (one of the main plot lines depends on her interpreting her own feelings) or her passionate sexuality. (Those of you who recall the insipid 'sex' of the Matrix Trilogy must have wondered if future societies also demand all hormones be removed before any snogging occurs.) Neither are the eye-popping year 2415 technologies cine-standardised \u0096 they show a sensuous imagination: from the flowing futurescapes of Bregna city, ingestible telepathic liquids, subcutaneous communicators and biological gardens of defence weaponry flowers, Aeon Flux has a lushness that draws you in.\n\nIt's a pleasant change to have a sci-fi movie directed by a woman, with a woman's touch. Karyn Kusama has brought her feminine insight to what is all too frequently seen as a male genre and, as she did with Girlfight, imbued it with freshness and realism. Although the studio has emphasised its comic-strip provenance, this was probably ill-advised as comparisons fare poorly and the movie should be enjoyed as entertainment in its own right. You will probably know from the brief descriptions whether this is the sort of film for you - while Aeon Flux will hardly win over any new adherents, it is a joy for cult fans and one that will withstand repeated viewing."

But she wasn't the worst thing about this piece of crap movie. How could she be when one of the characters has HANDS for FEET. That really makes a lot of sense. I'm not even going to start on why that stupid idea wouldn't work. Then there's the killing and cloning because they can't reproduce, that the memories of the cloned people would be cloned with them, the ridiculous old guy in that gay costume on the flying turd where something, I think it's the cloning, takes place, and the moronic hit squad run by some red-haired musical theater reject.\n\nAll together it forms one of the worst movies ever made.

The Tomatometer's gauge at rottentomatoes.com levels off at an extremely cool 10% approval rating; meaning 90% of the critics DIDN'T like it.\n\nMost of the bashing comes via comparisons to CATWOMAN (another bomb) or the fact that the original \u00c6on Flux was an animated feature on MTV and the translation to live-action cinema didn't work. Not having seen these animated versions \u0097 or CATWOMAN for that matter \u0097 I can't make any comparisons. But what I can do is tell you how the movie flowed, how well it was acted, and its entertainment value.\n\nCharlize Theron (NORTH COUNTRY) stars as \u00c6on Flux, a rebel in the 25th century. A terrible disease has decimated humanity and its surviving members hide behind an enclosure, cut-off from the possible devastating effects of what lay beyond (think LOGAN'S RUN and you'll be close). Within the confines of their home live the remaining five million members of society thanks to the medical efforts of the Goodchild Regime, named after Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas). \u00c6on Flux belongs to an elite group of resistance fighters known as the Monicans who's goal is to topple the Goodchild Regime. People have been vanishing. Police actions are resulting in deaths. And \u00c6on Flux is going to find out why.\n\nAs we move through the stronghold of humanity (the city is known as Bregna), we learn and see much about this futuristic yet completely alien-like society. Pills can heighten awareness and even send coded messages to ones brain. Computers look like musical instruments or a type of String Theory. Everyone feels that something is wrong with their world ...and there is. Cloning and its effects on the power-base of the Goodchild Regime are holding humanity back at a terrible price.\n\nCATWOMAN comparisons aside (yes, Charlize looks fantastic in her skin-tight leather outfit), this is a thinking person's film. There are lots of little tidbits thrown into the film that give it a futuristic look without trying too hard (the computers were a nice touch, as were filming many external shots in Berlin, Germany where new construction is the rage).\n\nThe pacing of the film was excellent. Never once did it get bogged down in the minutia of the times or the science. If you can't keep up, oh well. Leaping from action sequence to fight scene to action sequence made the 93 minutes fly by. The acting was okay. Nothing special but nothing horrible either. Charlize was the shining star, of course, and gave a relatively fine performance.\n\nFor my time, this was extremely entertaining and sexy, and full of great sci-fi scenery.\n\nOnly one question remains: What's up with the critics?!"

While it's marginally better than the utterly appalling ULTRAVIOLET, which saw Milla Jovovich up against vampire in a similar production, it's still far from great.\n\nThe problem with the movie isn't so much the story, which has plenty of potential, but rather the style. Much of the blame can be laid at the door of director Karyn Kusama, who with this and JENNIFER'S BODY has proved herself to be adept at making trash. A lot of the film is let down by low-rent martial arts shenanigans that copy THE MATRIX trilogy and never once provide originality. At least EQUILIBRIUM's 'gun fu' was something we hadn't seen before...\n\nThe typically cold Charlize Theron plays a cold-hearted assassin who soon discovers that the world she lives in is built on a lie. As twists go, this one has the potential to be good, but somehow the reveal feels diluted, there isn't enough passion or surprise in the eventual discovery. It's more of a \"oh, okay\" type moment than a \"wow\" one.\n\nThe supporting cast isn't up to much either, with only Marton Csokas making an effort. Jonny Lee Miller is as inane as ever, and Sophie Okonedo is miscast and way out of her comfort zone. Watch out for Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite in comedy cameo roles; I'm guessing they must have been desperate for the cash to appear in this knock-off. From beginning to end, AEON FLUX screams predictability and there's really no good reason to bother with it."

Also a resistance has been formed to stop this illusion. It may seem confusing at first, but you just have to \"think outside the box\" in order to understand it. Also, don't take an immature thirteen year old boy to see this, because during a scene when Aeon is half naked, my friend, not even meaning to, yelled out \"Sweet!\" really loud and the black lady sitting with her daughter in front of us turned around and told us to shut up. I'm totally serious."

Even worse, it's attached to a movie where good science is left by the curb for more action.\n\nAeon Flux is a futuristic action movie, but it never proposes to tell any science. The movie is clearly an unbelievable fantasy setting with fruit trees and grass as weapons, people inexplicably falling from planes and surviving, and people who remember memories from past lives. Not that any of that is bad, but the producers' commentary on the DVD spoke endlessly about how they made a Sci Fi movie.\n\nWhat SCIENCE does this movie have to include it in the Sci Fi genre? Movies set in the future or using an alternate reality are FANTASY movies. Fantasy is a perfectly legitimate genre in books, but somehow it gets lost in cinema. Calling scientifically incorrect movies Sci Fi gives it a bad image, so film producers should respect the Science Fiction as a separate genre.\n\nMovie review sites, like IMDb should use, should at least have a Fantasy category. Fantasy movies do not need to get lumped into Science Fiction, like Aeon Flux, a movie that uses the future setting simply to show women performing kung-fu in skin-tight costumes.\n\nIf you are looking for an action film staring attractive females, then this movie will work for you. While this is no way an intellectual movie, it has very nice sets, fair acting, and a fast moving plot set in a FANTASY setting."

It was enjoyable, it entertained, and I liked the style and art direction of the action and edgy scenes. I loved Aeon Flux's character and costume, and the plot was surprisingly well written and I did not seem to find many problems overall that I had with it and always find pleasure in watching it every time.

I thought it would be something like Elektra, or Underworld or some superhero movie.I was right about it being light and forgettable, but it was a little better than I expected.\n\nWhat I liked about this movie:\n\nWell the best part of this movie, is the last thing I would expect it would be good in this kind of movie, is the plot. It's interesting and makes sense in the post apocalyptic world it's being set. Start's slow and unpredicted, but turns out quite good.\n\nThe effects in Aeon Flux are quite ordinary comparing to other Sci-fi movies, still they look good, and clearly not exaggerated.\n\nWhat I disliked about Aeon Flux:\n\nThe major disadvantage of this movie I think is the lead role played by Charlize Theron. Though she's very sexy and compelling, and her acting is good, her elastic, eye catching, body movement betrays her role of a cold blooded assassin. She's just don't fit to this character. Her kicks and punches look soft and tender. Maybe this is not her fault ( director's one), but she really falls short in comparison with Milla Juvovich in Resident Evil and it's sequel, or Kate Beckinsale in Underworld.\n\nAnother flaw is the action. The fight scenes are too artificial and non-realistic, and most of the shootouts don't have the special touch (like John Woo's in his gun shootouts).\n\nMore minor flaw, but still an irritating one is the lack of connection among the places we're being shown. Not connection to the plot, but a passage from one place to another. We're told where to Aeon Flux is going, but most of the time we don't see her moving from place to place. One minute she's inside the Goodchild's territory, inside the building. The other minute she's at the garden laboratory inside the Goodchild's territory. How did she get there if she's never been there before?"

I stumbled across a reference to this film and without knowing anything about it or the cartoon, came to IMDb for an impartial viewpoint.\n\nIt's a shame because I like this sort of movie and after reading the reviews thought I would enjoy it. The acting is good and can't really be faulted and the story line I was happy with but it just seemed to crawl along and ended a little feebly. There was one point where I thought that it was about to get really interesting and I was excited about the rest of the movie (about half way in) but I was sadly let down as it sort of petered out with some odd action and a bland ending.\n\nI haven't seen the cartoon so cannot comment on the comparison but what really let it down for me was the terrible editing. There were so many scenes (particularly the action scenes) where it just didn't add up. It was often as if the film was skipping forward 5 seconds as something would happen, and then some bizarre thing would occur. An example is where Aeon would be jumping through the air to land face down but suddenly it cut to her lying on her back. There were at least 5 occasions where this sort of thing was blatantly obvious. It just hacked me off as it seemed sloppy whereas a little extra care may have delivered the film in a nice slick package.\n\nOn a positive note the sets and outfits were great, the dialogue was a lot better than many films I have seen and the story on the whole was good but poorly executed. This could be one of those films that gets a cult following but for me, a guy who is usually tolerant of low budget productions, it was just sloppy execution for a $62m film.\n\nI thought this was a lot like Underworld with Kate Beckinsale as the beautiful assassin but this doesn't hold a candle to Underworld in my opinion which I loved and have enjoyed many times. Both films are similar with Underworlds Gothic feel replaced with a quirky but likable futuristic aura. (Underworld budget $22m)\n\nI give it a 5 as it was a good idea, it tries hard but poor editing was too much for me. Given a good re-edit I would perhaps give it 7.5 but 5 was all I could muster...give it a try if you get the opportunity but don't get too excited."

What was not great was the camera person who did not capture their fight scenes well at all, I am truly disappointed in that because the women worked hard at doing their own stunts and the camera failed to capture them. I wonder if they will come out with a second act? They could capitalize on it and do a better camera work and a bit more intense story line. Overall, a pretty good movie."

If so, that's a real shame.\n\nAs a standalone movie, Aeon Flux has a lot going for it. It's stylish and looks good throughout. I felt it was pretty well cast, no complaints about the main characters - Theron looks great in this, although I'm not a huge fan. There were one or two minor characters I felt could have played a slightly larger role. The storyline is reasonably tight, in the mold of the classic sci-fi short story - the best kind for movies. There's certainly plenty of action, although I felt it lacked a certain something, perhaps not paced quite right, so the action sequences don't quite have the impact they could have had.\n\nBottom line, this is solid entertainment if you like sci-fi action movies, and different enough that you don't feel like you've seen it before, unlike so much Hollywood sci-fi. Not Oscar material by any means, well worthy of a 7/10."

She finally gets that chance when the leader of the group Aeon works for assigns her to assassinate Trevor. But as she soon finds out, the things that she was taught to be true start to prove to be fabricated.\n\nThe movie offers some nice action scenes in the style of The Matrix and Equilibrium, but no scene registered to me even as remotely special. The script was so boring and dull, and it also seemed that too little is revealed about Aeon's past. She is the best assassin working for the Mohicans, but what made her to be that? Why does she do what she does? I can understand how she might have felt after her sister's death, but before that her intentions of working for the Mohicans is not clear.\n\nAll in all, Aeon Flux is another summer blockbuster that offers lots of eye candies but nothing more in categories of story, character development, etc. than its predecessors."

        "review_detailed_main": "Problem: A big bunch of story from a series (ten times or so the running time of a movie) needs to be condensed into a easy-to-understand, entertaining 90min movie. Common Solutions: a)drop the series or b)overload the movie until it breaks down. Aeon Flux tries to go with both ways. It tames the series and especially the protagonist with kind of a new storyline. This leaves enough freedom in the story world for everyone to get along. But, for the b)-solution, it stumps the exposition into one solid block of story. The first 30 minutes (of approx. 85) are a nuisance of compressed, boiled down and abbreviated bits & pieces of information. This makes characters, plot and even the dystopian idea of the movie shallow and foreseeable. Therefore the script fails in the opening and nearly kills the whole movie with it. In addition, the dialogue and the camera work are cheesy and way too simple for the information the movie wants to give. Sentences like \"Once I had a live,now I had a mission\" should be forbidden and punished by the god of scripts himself. And for the camera: kidnapping victims do not drop red scarves in Technicolor and slow motion. This is not only simple, this is just cheap. And the cheap effect is sought fairly often, leading to the flat characters. My hand was already on its way to remote control, when suddenly \u00e1 miracle happened: the movie started to flow. After 30 minutes or so (with the first meeting of Aeon and Goodchild), things started to roll. And from this point on it was like watching a different movie. Characters gained character, dialogs became entertaining, the action sequences were tense and gripping (despite a bunch of bad CGIs). Even the conventional MTV-camera style of the introduction found new ways and some excellent image compositions. Charlize Theron started to become credible as Aeon and Csokas enriched the movie greatly after his first real appearances with more then 3 sentences. Even the shallow (partly foreseeable) plot gained a bit of depth and found some better twists towards the end. Everything turned into a nice action sci-fi romp. My explanation for this extreme division of the movie would be that the writers and also the director knew that the series R.O.C.K.E.D. and had a clear vision about the \"rocking\" itself but they had a hard time developing the stage for the show. So it turns out to be a good action flick in the end but falls flat on any larger scale and has its harsh shortcomings in structure and substance. The recommendation for a excellent adaption of a sci-fi series to the big screen still is Serenity. And the best Dystopia with a low budget still is Equilibrium. This is only too bad. The potential had been there to come up with something really innovative. But finances might have played a part in this, too. The movie has a hard time to shake off a \"sci-fi Xena\"-TV double episode charm. With a bigger budget for a better production and 30 minutes more to develop in senseful manner this could have been a great movie. As it is now, it is just a slightly above average mainstream movie. You can watch it, you don't need to watch it."

I am glad I did.\n\nI understand how people with expectations based on their familiarity with an \"original\" (in any medium) can be disappointed by a subsequent movie version. I had no expectations, and I found this movie to be a terrific experience in its own right. I agree wholeheartedly with one reviewer who termed it: \"Cerebral. Dynamic. Trippy. Sexy.\" I can only add that I thought that it was also imaginative, and extremely artistic in its framing of scenes. I was transported to another world depicted through the eyes of a painter. While I certainly didn't understand its underpinnings, I didn't have to in order to enjoy the experience. In fact, I was kind of glad that the film didn't really provide any explanations of the technology, and instead just took me on a fantastic ride.\n\nI thought the relatively sparse dialog was great. I thought Charlize Theron was tough, hot, hip and beautiful. Oh yeah, I also liked her acting. In fact I liked all of the acting in this movie. This movie took me on an interesting, entertaining, visually compelling trip. For sci-fi fans NOT familiar with any other Aeon Flux productions, I enthusiastically recommend this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was very excited to hear Aeon Flux was being made a while back because I am a fan of the show. I was so excited I kept tabs on its production throughout the year. When I saw the trailer though, I was shocked. There were some really cheesy and clich\u00e9 action-flick lines in the trailer and the only glimpse of her acrobatics was her crawling, rather slowly, across the grass. I thought it was going to be horrible, not including the fact that her costume and hair (for a while I was angered her hair wasn't the same as the shows, but after watching it, I think it looks fine) were completely different. The trailer made me believe it was going to be full of corniness like \"Catwoman.\" Nevertheless, I wanted to fully see how it would turn out because the behind-the-scenes footage looked decent. I was surprised when I saw the film.\n\nIt was visually stunning. I was happy they decided to deviate from the dark, urban looking future that defines many sci-fi films like \"the Matrix\" and \"Blade Runner\" (not because I was going to compare it to \"the Matrix\" as many people now mistakenly call movies with saturated colors and black clothing \"Matrix ripoffs\"... that's been done forever, \"the Matrix\" isn't the only one). It's pretty colorful and fresh-looking, somewhat like the setting of the show (okay, okay, the movie is more colorful than the show, but it's still 'new'). Charlize's acrobatics are very good. Very graceful. When Kusama, in the behind-the-scenes footage online said Charlize is very a very graceful actress, physically, I was a bit hesitant to agree... but when I saw the film, my doubts were shattered... it was pretty darn good for a live action film. Her bendy flips and all of that were very Aeon-like. Very very impressive.\n\nThe story was okay. It did dwell one some interesting current issues, but the timing of the film makes it look like 'it's been done'. (Following other sci-fi films like the Island and Gattaca.) I wish it could have been released earlier... Even so I liked how the story itself included many elements of the show. Even little nuances like the \"tongue passing pill\" kiss scene...(that's in the trailer) I recognized that from Gravity... if I remember correctly...\n\nCharacter development, like others have mention, is pretty minimal. I thought Kusama could have done a better job with this as there is lot of movie time left (this is only something like an hour and a half... could have stretched it long like \"Batman Begins\")... but I'm not so sure. Granted, there could have been a pacing problem if the story was stretched longer. Anyway, the parts where there were attempts to develop character were glaringly obvious. There would be a line or two passed between characters and you feel like there should be a bit more behind it... or you wish for it...\n\nAeon's character has been a little sexed-down unfortunately (I'm a girl, but I thought the overt sexuality of the show/personality made Aeon much more interesting)... but there are little hints of her 'former'-self, I guess you could say. They throw in a line/action or two. She's also made a little more human... I think that was done to attract a wider audience though... sometimes her ruthlessness in the show was unexplained, but seemingly allowable... This might not have worked for the film.\n\nBut even so, this is a pretty fast paced, artsy action film. I really enjoyed it. It does seem pretty shallow but it stands out from other stupid superhero/sci-fi films that have come out lately like \"Fantastic Four\". It is even and maintains a constant theme/tone and the combination of story/issue elements make it unique... much like the show. Unfortunately there isn't too much of Aeon hard-hitting dark humor (although what there is, is pretty funny ^^), but it's still enjoyable. I think it's worth your $10 bucks, or whatever you pay to see a movie. Even if the story doesn't excite you, at least the weirdness and \"What the f*** just happened?/is that?\" factor (also from the show) will keep you there.\n\nWhat I don't get is why they didn't let critics comment/preview it... I agree with Ebert/Roeper (just saw the show today :P) that even the preview looks better than a lot of other similar films out there... anyhoo, guess we'll never know why they chose not to do so...\n\n--Oh yeah I also enjoyed the Stuart Townsend cameo (Charlize's boyfriend... or is it fianc\u00e9?)... I'm a big fan of his too :)... Although his spiked hair and black eye were not very flattering... :P--"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I saw \"Aeon\" last night, and I found the movie to be more of an homage to the series, itself, than a true stand-alone feature. It seemed to me like the writers just plucked as many names and gadgets from individual episodes as they could, and laid them upon a skeleton of a storyline. As a fan, I appreciate that, as the series has been largely ignored post-cancellation, but to the general movie-going public, I can see why it would seem to be a sub-par feature.\n\nAs far as my problems with character translation, my biggest gripe is with the writers' interpretation of Trevor. In the series, he was quite methodical and quite full of himself, though he did have a tender and compassionate side to him. I felt the film version of Trevor was far too soft and innocent.\n\nI wasn't completely satisfied with Aeon, either. I felt that the film version was far more idealistic than the animated one. During the show, Aeon was an anarchist, out only for herself and only occasionally humanity. Here, she seemed to be more of humanity's great champion, out to avenge the wrongs done by the Goodchild regime. Plus, her relationship with Trevor during the show was far more contentious and love/hate than it was in the film.\n\nI thought Theron's performance as Aeon was passable, and I do appreciate her working so hard, both physically and mentally, to do her best at portraying Aeon; but, with such a weak script, I wasn't impressed. As Trevor said in one episode, \"I know cats always land on their feet, but at this point, there's really no floor.\"\n\nPerhaps if the writers had more closely followed the original subject matter, the movie would have been more compelling. However, in its current state, the film is, at best, an all right homage to the show. At the very least, it spurred MTV to finally release the balance of the series on DVD and heightened the public's interest in Peter Chung's work. As an \"Aeon\" fan, I give the film a 5/10."

(2000), a more luscious Gattaca (1997), a more updated, technically superior, well-budgeted Logan's Run (1976), Aeon Flux enters the science fiction genre as a THX-1138 (1971) for the 21st Century.\n\nThe somewhat light weight ending, the generic kill climax, and around two underdeveloped loose ends, overall Aeon Flux is a gorgeous looking, futuristic looking movie that blends the best of science fiction visualization along with a tight script, with good pacing, great action, and decent characterization and feelings."

        "review_detailed_main": "The key to enjoying this film is not to compare it to the original animation. Aside from the names of the characters and 1 or 2 nods to the cartoon (like the opening sequence of a fly in the eyelashes), there is very little in common between the two.\n\nThe original animation was a very expressionistic piece of art, without dialogue, often without any plot, and with distorted perspectives of reality. This film, in the opposite corner, has an strong plot, a good bit of dialogue and a relatively realistic presentation. I can understand the cartoon fans' outrage, but I believe a faithful film adaptation would've been impossible unless you got someone like Fellini to direct it, and then the audience would hate it because it wouldn't make sense. On top of that, you'd need a silicone-enhanced porn star to take the leading role because I doubt anyone else would agree to do gymnastics while wearing a thong the size of a postage stamp.\n\nIn other words, if a film had to be made about Aeon Flux, they might as well go in the opposite direction which is what they did here. As I said, this is a very plot-driven story, clever and at times philosophical with the theme of nature vs. science, or perhaps you could see it as chaos vs. order (Werner Herzog would be thrilled). If it were slowed down and extended an hour or two, I think this would've made a fantastic Kubrickian mindbender \u00e0 la \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", but instead they went for a more general audience by making Aeon Flux an action flick. No gripes there; there's plenty of action to keep you from snoozing, and the special effects, while being computer generated, are not obnoxiously so.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that it was far too conservative in the costumes department. Aeon's whole identity (in the animation) was based on her overflowing sexuality even though she was a somewhat androgynous personality. Charlize Theron achieved the somewhat androgynous personality, but the visual sexuality was lacking because they had her dressed up in what looked like a scuba suit most of the time. So I guess I and a whole generation of at-the-time-prepubescent-teen-boys will have to go watch our VHS copy of Barbarella for our dose of intergalactic smut. Drat.\n\nAeon Flux presents a somewhat de-sexed, female action hero which itself is a novelty. My guess is that the director purposely did it this way, perhaps to achieve a level of believability that you can't get when your star is wearing a postage stamp. In the spirit of the original Bionic Woman TV series of the 70s which had a hot actress but didn't sink to showing skin & gratuitous cheesecake, we have the same thing here with Charlize Theron. I think she pulled it off brilliantly. A very entertaining flick."

        "review_detailed_main": "\u00c6on Flux is directed by Karyn Kusama and is a loose adaptation of the animated science fiction television series of the same name created by animator Peter Chung. Written by Phil Hay & Matt Manfredi, it stars Charlize Theron, Sophie Okonedo, Marton Csokas, Jonny Lee Miller, Pete Postlethwaite & Frances McDormand. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh.\n\nPost-apocalyptic future 2415, and 99% of the Earth's population has been wiped out, victims to a virus that struck in 2011. What survivors there are now reside in Bregna, a walled city state which is ruled by a collective of scientists. An apparent safe nirvana on the surface, Bregna is however beset with problems. Enter the Monicans, an underground rebel organisation who communicate telepathically and follow orders given by The Handler. When \u00c6on Flux (Theron), a Monican agent, is given a mission to assassinate Trevor Goodchild (Csokas), the last surviving government leader of the human state, she discovers the sad truth about humanity's survival.\n\nHaving not been aware of the MTV animated series that this film is based on, it was easy for me to enter into a viewing devoid of expectation or anticipation. I'd heard that it was frowned upon by the fans of the series, and certainly in my home country of the UK, the critics were particularly scornful about it. But in for a penny, in for a pound I went. You know what? All the negative press is justified! A seriously unfulfilling dystopian based actioner that riffs on far better movies and literary sources that have come before it. Yes there's some dazzle effects work for the undemanding, and yes, Theron is lithe, athletic and sexy in the lead role; even if she looks totally miserable and lacking emotional gravitas for the character as written. But with clunky dialogue permeating the narrative and the likes of Postlethwaite and McDormand miscast and ridiculous, this is an expensive futuristic stinking flop. 3/10"

It had a very European feel to it too, which was a refreshing change from the normal pathetic attempts at true sci-fi from Hollywood (no films mentioned). Ms Theron and the rest of the cast/crew have done the impossible, they managed to make a good film adaptation that is better than the anime cartoon series it was based on. Anyone who enjoys cool science fiction and has a sense of humour should really enjoy this movie. I think there should be a sequel. To compare this movie to the horrendous Catwoman is outrageous and i'm dubious whether they have actually seen this movie."

Inheriting a film they could care less about, the talented director Karyn Kusama had the film taken away from her in post and Aeon Flux had major surgery done to it. 25 minutes were cut, characters entirely cut out and the result is a very pretty film, but a film that just doesn't make any damn sense. After Paramount's gutting, it was dumped with little fanfare and no screenings for critics. The visuals keep this watchable, but most of the film is like watching an action test pattern. Any depth on every character must have been cut out and Frances McDormand's hair dresser must have had a nervous breakdown before sending her out to the set. In it's current state, Aeon Flux plays like an outline of a film with not an ounce of emotion, heart or depth. I'd like to say a director's cut would be nice at some point, but honestly I'd rather Kusama make a far better project with better material."

At least the cartoon made you actually interested in the plot because it seems as though they just made the movie with the characters and said \"F\" the original story. Sometimes it was confusing on which direction they were taking. One minute you were like, \"finally they're going to explain this,\" then they just start fighting. Typical crappy fight scenes are quite hilarious as you watch a particular \"all hands\" fighter which is re-dick-ulous. Sorry I can't elaborate because I don't want to spoil it for you.

If you are familiar with any science fiction film since the Matrix, or those that have come from comic book origins, all the calling cards are there. The film is action packed, with lots of women taking action packed roles - particularly Charlize Theron. Some may consider the film a bit of a chick flick, but if you like science fiction, action or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, & I know I do, I think you'll enjoy this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like Frances McDormand's hair in this film this opinion piece is all over the place The comic adaptation of Peter Chung's Aeon Flux TV series is a mixed blessing of a movie. There is much to love about it, and there is much to hate about it and the two cancel each other out.\n\nThe plot has Aeon Flux trying to kill the leader of the surviving band of humans in a virus ravaged earth. The plot itself is rather straight forward even if the details are needlessly obscured. The whys and hows are all there if you're willing to wade through the violence and form over substance sequences, the question is are you going to be awake at the end to hear the denouncement? Possibly not.\n\nThe problem in a nutshell is that this film wants to be all things to all people, it wants to copy the source material but be its own film; it wants to be big and showy and have an intimate sci-fi story at its heart; it wants to be weird and cutting edge, yet wants to be normal. It looks like it was designed together sequence by sequence by committee and then given to the director to fit together. It doesn't work, or rather it works in pieces but not as a whole.\n\nI was completely bored for the first third and then I just began to take it as a series of sequences and shots that sort of went together and then I found I kind of liked it. I do not think it holds together as a film but I think on paper and in pieces it does.\n\nI can't really recommend the film, but I can't discount that undemanding sci-fi fans who like less than clear musings might like it. 4 out of 10 instead of 5 simply because I can't say try it...maybe its a 4.8, I don't know, maybe worth a shot on cable"

And generally just enjoy Charlize Theron! She is the reason I didn't go lower in my rating! She really holds up her own ... Frances McDormand ... I didn't even realize she was in this. But she is ... so there is some interesting casting choices you may be able to just enjoy.

        "review_detailed_main": "Just got back from the movie. Full disclosure: I'm a fan of the Liquid Television/MTV show, and will be looking at the film in this context.\n\nThe film eschews most of the dangerous aspects of Cheung's Aeon while the new material represents a classic \"closed loop\" story, or for McKee followers, story rather than anti-story. The biotech stuff is intriguing conceptually, but the execution is so pedestrian that none of it grabs you (I'll give a nod to Trevor's pollen as an exception). The clean look of the production design is matched by a very safe, bright photography that makes for a sterility that, while helpful in underscoring the notion of an over-controlled utopia, looks simple and more to the point completely reverses the \"lived in\" grime of the original animated universe. It will lose nothing going to DVD because there is so little detail anywhere.\n\nThe sexual aspect never had to be explicit, but it did need to have some shock or kink value to have any faithfulness to the original, easily accomplished within PG-13 constraints through innuendo - they took a pass on it. Amazing that the trailer for \"Underworld: Evolution\" which screened before the film made me think \"Aeon\" more that the film of the name (Ms. Beckinsale just has more taunt in her)!\n\nThis is a safe, linear narrative, when it should have been treated like a cross between film- noir and one of David Lynch's less accessible films. They did good by not making Trevor a villain, but they blew it by making him and Aeon heroes (and what happened to Trevor's narcissism?). WTF? Aeon Flux was a capricious conniving I-can't-even-say-it! The old Aeon did the right thing only when she thwarted those doing wrong, but the shoe was on the other foot more then once. In Aeon's world, tragedy should trump hope, and the flaw should be both Aeon and Trevor's, not palmed off on some fabricated straw man like the brother.\n\nIn closing: where's the ugliness? Hell even Aeon's vixen-self was contorted into grotesquerie half the time in the old days. Repellent fascination? This movie was neither repellent nor fascinating. Ms. Theron is undeniably beautiful, and has proved her ability elsewhere, but despite some creditable action sequences, and solid production values all-around, Karen Kusama doesn't seem to have much command of tone or mood, and this project needed to be drenched in both to call itself Aeon Flux. I should need a bath afterwords, instead I'm going out for a drink to wash the clean off."

This live version did it's cartoon predecessor proud, making the action and fight sequences slick and entertaining. A few scenes have direct elements from the original Aeon Flux except for the extreme body count, massive blood, and mountains of corpses. Because this movie is only rated PG13, these kind of scenes (and other sexual scenes) were omitted. If this movie was rated R more bloody sci-fi violence and having Theron's Aeon outfit show more skin, would have made this adaptation even better. The best part of the movie are the beautifully colorful sets and crafted scenery, the costumes are pretty sharp as well. If your a fan of the animated series, you'll be happy with this live version. Aeon Flux is a great \"tough guy\" and this movie solidifies her as a true action hero"

Makes no sense.lemme tell ya: While I was sitting there watching the movie all I noticed was aeon waking up every damn minute. It sucked so much I felt like I should be the one waking up from this nightmare of watching this movie. I mean they had flying tampons and when aeon whistles these marbles come out of the ground and blow up a wall. Aeon also kept asking all these questions about why is she in a curtain place, then I was thinking why am I in this certain place watching this stupid movie. If you have seen Dark Water and agree with me that it sucks so much then you'd know. i swear to god this movie makes no sense. shes in one place then shes in another then she wakes up then she talks about why shes here then she walk around and kisses random guys and fights a black chick with hands for feet.Its kinda like the Worst matrix movie ever."

Then people begin to have severe headaches and strange dreams, still unaware of what is happening to them.\n\nAeon Flux is part of a rebel organisation called The Monicans, they are opposed to what they perceive as an oppressive regime that restricts freedom and hides secrets from the people. They plan to fight back and eliminate the figurehead of the Goodchild Dynasty that has ruled for 400 years. Aeon's sister is killed by them and many others disappear without explanation.\n\nI found Charlize to be perfect for this role. She was very athletic, incredibly hot and fitted extremely well into the very tight spandex outfits of this future world, most importantly however she played the part very well. At first ice cold in the performance of her orders as a Monican but as unexplained things start to occur and the lines become blurred as to what she must do, the emotion starts to subtly creep into her performance and her character develops a more human side.\n\nI think this is definitely a movie that needs to be seen more than once and contains both exhilarating action and interesting issues for one to think about.\n\nIt is certainly a cut above many sci-fi films and definitely better than The Fifth Element, Catwoman, Spiderman 2, X-Men 2.\n\nFor me it was as good as the original X-Men & Spiderman films."

Very well done, very interesting directions taken, and VERY good imagery. If you're holding onto the cartoon too much, don't go see it expecting a shot for shot re-make. I think they did very well with what they were taking from - after all, \u00c6ON FLUX (the cartoon) was a strange journey, and would be tough for anyone to re-create."

        "review_detailed_main": "Was recommended by a friend with DVDs of both the TV animation and the movie.\n\nThe animation left me rather flat, almost skipped watching the movie. So obvious, so much focus on crotches with plot lines like what we dreamed up as pre-pubescent kids on Saturday afternoons. Arbitrary switching of alliances, betrayals and shifting identities. Switching to the movie I was expecting Charlize Theron running around in a chastity belt and not much else.\n\nSuch a stylish film. At first I just focused on the art direction, the look was so in-your-face and consistently fresh and brilliant. Gradually the characters and plot lines began to mesh into a coherent whole. This was actually about something and definitely not predictable. Even the art direction continued to evolve by stages, from a very California look to a distinctly European feel. Every shot very beautiful, nature never very far away.\n\nA thriller/scifi with mostly women in the action parts. How unusual. A woman producer and a woman director. And a story line with very contemporary themes we're all thinking about, anticipating in the very near future -- massive species killing diseases, cloning as a commonplace reality, the dream of denying death and what that might mean.\n\nGet this dialogue:\n\nHe: The cloning is all we have. If you do this, we end. She: We're meant to die. It's what makes anything about us matter. Nothing like this torture.\n\nWith lesser actors, lesser art direction and if placed at the beginning instead of, as here, at the summation, those same lines would be stilted groaners. In context, they actually say something.\n\nLoved it. Now I realize why it got such good reviews from the serious press. I'm looking forward to seeing it again with the commentaries."

        "review_detailed_main": "Aeon Flux managed to capture the storyline and let it unfold in an amazingly short amount of time, but didn't leave me with a feeling that I was short-changed in any way. The movie played out much like the original Aeon Flux on MTV's Liquid Television in that there were many things that happened that didn't offer explanation and you got past that pretty well because the plot wasn't necessarily why I watched the show. It was the character's unnerving feelings and her desire to figure out what was going on. She was determined and she was super sexy. The movie tones down the sexy stuff to the point where I was a little disappointed that the erotic stuff was non-existent. However, it was a great movie, a definite recommend."

        "review_detailed_main": "Critics have started calling it the Oscar Winner club, understandably. What after Halle Berry won it for Monsters Ball then going straight to the diabolical Catwoman. Hilary Swank triumphs in Boys Don't Cry and follows it with The Core. Jamie Foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the dull Stealth after scooping a gong for Ray. Now it's seems Hollywood Starlet Charlize Theron craps all over her \"Monster\" Oscar with this one of the worst Sci-fi spectacles ever made.\n\nThe film loses its audience interest after a mere 20 minutes meaning the only thing really worth staying for is the fact that despite the film being rubbish Charlize Theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a crude and laughable premise. Not only is \u00c6on Flux ultimately shallow but for an action flick it's also really very dull. It will only really appeal to comic book fans and Horney teenagers who like the idea of Theron running around half naked for 90 minutes. Flux only really succeed in failing.\n\nSet against the 2011 virus that kills 99% of the world's populace, and in the last city on Earth, Bregna, the survivors, some four hundred years later, in the year 2415, are continuing to live in the Goodchild dynasty, the name of the scientist who developed its cure.\n\nAll is not well in this utopia and it is not what lies beyond its high walls that protects its citizens from the never ending jungle but what unspoken, unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unfortunates' together that lies within these walls of paranoia, conformity and unquestionable obedience. Filmed in and around Berlin, ironically, this is a story set against a totalitarian state, a walled city, where its peoples are no longer capable of reproducing, and its sinister and most secret plot of how it sustains life.\n\n\u00c6on Flux is the assassin that has been assigned by the underground rebels to change the course of Mankind, forever. This is the story of her fight for justice, freedom and revenge.\n\n\u00c6on Flux combined lousy narratives, ropy pacing and truly dire effects. Looking more like an unrealistic video game rather than a film. The only thing that is fortunate about the failure is that no sequels are in the works, Flux might just be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history, thank god for the lousy box office takings then.\n\nMy final verdict on this truly lousy feature? There really isn't a story here just Charlize Theron jumping around in a black suit like a grass hopper. The acting is very wooden moronic and emotionless compared to the other cinemas that are out there today. It try's too much to be like an adaption and doesn't really take much from the cartoon which is what I was expecting, the only thing that was done half right that pays tribute to the cartoon was the fly in the eye scene. Avoid at all costs."

        "review_detailed_main": "I, for one, have not watched the series before arriving at the theatre, so I knew nothing of the story before watching it. The design of the sets whetted my appetite, hinting at an intricate interaction between the characters and their environment, joined by a gripping background story. Unfortunately, the next hour of movie-watching destroyed my hopes and left me more than mildly annoyed.\n\nFirst to crush my hopes was the acting or, more accurately, the lack thereof. I could not associate with any of the characters but, apparently, neither could the actors. They lacked the usual passion, ambition, or sense of urgency that you usually expect from lead characters in an action film. They were casually talking to each other about their beliefs as if discussing their dinner preferences. Neither boons nor catastrophes could penetrate their veil of detachment. Consequently, I was wholly detached from anything they did.\n\nNext was the script. I was not able to suspend my disbelief enough to ignore the glaring scientific (and algebraic) mistakes. (So much for hoping that script writers know how to use a calculator.) I am always negatively impressed by those who manage to contradict what I learned in my Biology, Physics, and Math classes. My impression is, unfortunately, long-lasting.\n\nI wasn't as much disappointed by the action--but that was because most of today's films take shortcuts to choreographing fight sequences and zoom in while shaking the camera, zooming out suddenly to reveal the foes' defeat, leaving us wondering what had happened. I've grown desensitized to bad fight scenes, but not to inelegant (needless, explicit) violence, which seemed to have been added as an afterthought.\n\nHowever, the saving grace of the film was the design, and it is solely the design that prompted me to rate this film 7/10. Camera-wise, the film crew created a pleasing film (aside from the fighting). The outfits, although clich\u00e9, were interesting and clever; the buildings were pretty; the hairstyles were sharp. A small world had been constructed quite carefully in order to make this film. The designers did not take the future for granted: watch carefully to discern a whole new culture portrayed by recreating everyday commodities. This portrayal made it possible to accept such a view of the future, and accept that it actually /is/ the future.\n\nIronically, it is the design that left me most disappointed. The fantastic world ended up being but an empty shell without a story or characters to fill it. I was yearning for some other director to run off with the sets and fill them with another story; for some fans to re-dub the film and make it more appealing. All in all, the film to me was a showcase of imagination, unfortunately filled with actors who, even more unfortunately, spoke."

Normally I strive to give thoughtful reviews to those wondering if they should spend $10 to see the movie. But I'm struggling here and I just saw it... So I guess there's your answer. I think had I paid to go see it I would have been disappointed, but as it is, a free movie is a free movie.\n\nI went with a bunch of people from work, now we're all computer nerds mind you who all enjoy a good Sci-Fi, but the general consensus was that it was a pretty bad movie. I don't think I'm quite as harsh on it as my fellow coworkers, but for a movie that seemed rather big budget and had the beautiful Charlize Theron (and who knew she could be so sexy), in the end it seemed rather unmemorable to me, and that being a key point. It's hard to explain why though. The pace seemed okay, effects were pretty good, the story was rather straight forward though nothing really original, and it tried to give you some twists and turns. And even though it was filled with a steady pace of so so action, it still seemed to fall flat somehow. But not for a lack of Charlize strutting her stuff and showing some good curves throughout. It was kind of funny in fact how much they emphasized showing her off. They should have entitled the movie \"The Catwalk, staring Charlize Theron!\" Though admittedly she is a babe and this movie if nothing else proved that. Watch out Angelina, Charlize is coming on strong!\n\nFor the movie alone I'd give it a 4, however because Charlize Theron was such good eye candy appealing to my defenseless instinctual desires, I give it a 5 out of 10. So average I suppose, but only cause it had a sexy broad in it wearing skin tight clothes."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's true, the only reason why I wanted to see this was because I just wanted to see Charlize Theron bounce around in her black latex outfit. I expected nothing. I didn't expect this to be a faithful adaptation of the 1995 MTV Oddity TV show (which is an interesting show, must see!), I didn't expect it to be a worthy addition to the Aeon Flux universe, and hell...I didn't expect it to be any good.\n\nCharlize Theron was the only reason why I plucked down $5.25 for the movie ticket. And for the most part, it was worth it. However, the movie itself did surprise me pretty well because of my low expectations.\n\nTo sum it up, the entire beginning of the film is very slow and boring. The only real characters that are developed throughout the entire film are just Aeon and Trevor, which I thought they did a real good job near the end of the film. Everyone else either can't act or weren't THAT critical to the plot and character development as much as they should've been, which made them sort of worthless.\n\nBut when that lil' ol' plot twist kicks in, the film suddenly becomes a lot more interesting which is both a good and bad thing. Good because my $5.25 was actually being paid off for something other than Charlize Theron and Bad because it took over an hour for the film to become interesting and worth that $5.25. What the plot twist is, well...find out for yourself, through the movie or from other people's spoiler reviews. I thought it was implemented pretty well.\n\nAs far as any of the action and special effects featured here, very few things are as spectacular as the trailer made the film out to be. The hand-to-hand fighting is like what I saw in the Chronicles of Riddick and Batman Begins, the camera angles were zoomed in and abruptly edited up to the point you can't see what's going on and ultimately becomes unsatisfactory. They should've hired better choreographers and camera men who don't have Parkinson's disease, then the fight scenes would've probably been actually viewable and maybe a little more entertaining to watch.\n\nThe special effects, however, were not that bad. Very few (like what was in the trailer) were impressive to look at while everything else was iffy. Most of the time the director will try to impress you with presenting a prettied up scene with a certain camera angle to try to give it a \"unique\" feel, but that effect only works 15-20% of the time while the rest of the 80-85% give you a clich\u00e9 and rushed feeling, like you've seen it before or they're trying WAAAAAAAY too hard to impress you. The actual design of the sets and costumes were mediocre as well, they tried to do a \"Fifth Element meets Equilibrium\" with the Aeon Flux-style and ended up making something that's just plain odd to look at. And not odd in a unique and interesting way, odd in a blandish kinda way. They could've added more than just a few vibrant colors to bring the Aeon Flux world to life, but I give them credit for what they did do (the marble scene was one of the more impressive scenes in the entire movie).\n\nBut despite these major gripes, the movie didn't really suck as much as I anticipated. The plot twists were enjoyable, the two main characters are great to watch once you get accustomed to them, and overall it's not that bad of a movie. It's nothing special, nothing real noteworthy, but it's entertaining nonetheless. Plus with Charlize Theron gracing some type of skin tight black outfit throughout the entire film pretty much, you really can't go wrong."

While there is not much I can do to defend this poorly written film, I never felt the urge to walk out and I wasn't constantly checking my watch.\n\nI don't know why it is so hard to make a decent Science Fiction film. There is almost no character development and the dialog is about as bad as you will ever hear.\n\n\"Aeon Flux\" is nice to look at. The film is at it's best when it is blatantly artsy and unafraid to appear utterly ridiculous. It is almost enjoyable if you forget about trying to follow the plot. Just don't listen to any of the dialog. The story and the script are at the same level as \"The Island\" and that is not meant as a compliment.\n\nFrances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite are in the film for about 2 minutes each and are made to look as silly as possible. They really had to work for their paychecks. On the other hand, Charlize Theron looks great in her Catwoman outfit (without the cat ears.)\n\n\"Aeon Flux\" will be a great film for when it comes on cable because channel surfers will be watching bits and pieces which are better than watching this mess from beginning to end. It is a real credit to director Karyn Kusama that it is as watchable as it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on all the (almost exclusively) bad reviews I'd seen of this movie beforehand, Aeon Flux was quite a positive surprise. First let me say that it really helps to be familiar with the cartoon series. Otherwise a bunch of things won't make sense. And the movie does neglect to explain just what \"Monicans\" are, and it makes no mention that I noticed of the country of Monica. In fact, the portrayal of the world in which the action took place was not as detailed as it ought to have been. A major point of the cartoon show was the trans-humanism of such a future; that people could have all sorts of weird bio-cyber-things implanted. In the movie, all we really see of this is the hand-feet of Aeon's sidekick (and that \"meeting-in-the-mind\" thing). We should have been shown how this sort of thing was integrated into all levels of society. Unless of course the movie world was different than the cartoon world, which sadly takes a lot of the edge off of the concept. So that was one thing they should have done better. Maybe there'll be a director's cut with more details. I'd buy that.\n\nThe action that made it into the movie looked superb. The landscapes, architecture, general design, etc., and the characters' moves during the action scenes were amazing. I have only seen a small handful of Charlize Theron movies before, but this is definitely the movie where I enjoyed her the most. Perfect, long-legged, athletic agility, and an amazing face. And gorgeous costumes. Eye-candy of the highest order, and that's what mainly serves to recommend the movie.\n\nThe story, unfortunately, disappointed. It was very interesting up until the clone revelation. There was this device that could transfer a person between locations, looking like it peeled off a layer of reality. And since that Goodchild character had said that nothing is as it seems, I was expecting some ontological point, akin to Matrix or Stanislaw Lem's Futurological Congress, where reality is an illusion caused by certain chemicals in the air. Couple that with the strange rebirth of Aeon's sister, making us think that there was some kind of transfer of consciousness going on, or a form of bona-fide reincarnation. With that kind of expectations in mind, you can imagine what a massive let-down it was to learn that it was all about the people being cloned (and no, there were no transfer of consciousness, just the DNA). After the recent Star Wars movies and the bomb that was The Island, a plot involving clones would have to be pretty DAMN good in order to have any real originality or entertainment value. Here it was just anti-climactic. A big downer.\n\nAnd it's worse than that. The whole Goodchild Tyranny does not make sense. If they have cloning technology, there's a million ways they could use it. To me, the clone revelation just doesn't work at all as an explanation for the effective perpetuation of that society.\n\nSo overall Aeon Flux was an opportunity wasted (yeah, another one of those coming out of Hollywood; tragically they're the rule rather than the exception), but at least it looked damn good in the overall design and the action scenes, so I'm rating the movie higher than the story deserves.\n\n6 out of 10."

Those two blokes who wrote it must stay as far away from a computer as possible, they totally suck! As for the director, her previous movies like \"Girl fight\" wasn't so bad, but this! Charlize Theron is 'n South-African, like me, but I'm so very disappointed in our Golden Girl (winning an Oscar 2 years back) The material was irreversibly bad even though I could see the editors and special effect wizards was desperately trying to save it, without success. The special effects are weak and look as though it was done on my home computer! Even \"tetris\" has better graphics! Really a disappointment in every sense of the word."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll start off by saying that there isn't much about the animated series of Aeon Flux that I remember. I watched it maybe two or three times in my life and then thought little of it later on. But for some reason, when I saw the previews for this film, I had the desire to see it. So keep in mind, this is a review coming from a person who really hasn't seen the show enough times to draw any conclusions based on comparisons. I want to review Aeon Flux as a stand alone film.\n\nAeon Flux is a beautifully crafted film. The environments are sleek and imaginative, and the people have a futuristic style that is clever and not clich\u00e9. The action scenes manage to tickle your senses--most of the time. The choice of camera angles is also impressive, and it's good to see in a generation of action films heavily influenced by The Matrix films. Bullet-time is old. Although Aeon Flux doesn't set any new standards for action films like the underestimated \"Domino\" should have, it is still a visually encompassing movie to watch. One might argue that this isn't necessarily an action film either. Aeon Flux does have a decent story.\n\nIf you manage to sit through the first hour of the film, you will come to appreciate the visuals and the story. Aeon Flux spends a lot of time setting the viewer up for the plot, which at first, seems to be a bit forced and convoluted. The viewer will be left in a state of confusion as to what's going on. Add that to a series of redundant scenes and you might find yourself falling asleep if you see the late-night show...or joking around with friends like I was. I even was tempted to walk out. But if you have the patience, you will see this movie reveal it's brilliant plot and a collection of themes that inspire plenty of critical thinking. Too bad it ends thirty minutes later. The film is short, and you will be left stunned when you realize the movie is about to end, even though Aeon claims that there is still more to do. Nonetheless, the film has an edge of your seat ending with a bit of emotion as well, something the film doesn't convey in the beginning.\n\nPurists may be very disappointed. Newcomers with closed-minds will also be disappointed. But Aeon Flux is a movie that will keep you thinking about it for a few more days after you see it, and now I want to see the TV series. It might help me appreciate the movie even more, or in turn, it may not. Take a risk, go see this at the theaters."

I am a good Marton Csokas fan, and it's imperative for me to see his movies, hehe.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the film. The directing is artsy and beautiful, the sets are wonderfully sterile and still organic, and the story is interesting. The script was rather cheesy at times, but sometimes you just have to appreciate the cheese, especially when it spouted by such gorgeous, able actors.\n\nCharlize was almost annoyingly monotone for the first half of the film, but this fits with the original cartoon shorts, which I remember watching back in junior high. Marton Csokas is refreshingly human, a break from his habit of playing bad guys very, very well. The acting does tend toward minimalism, almost to the point of being stiff, but it fits with the mood of the film and its setting.\n\nAeon Flux is by no means a great movie, but it's also by no means a bad one. It's entertaining and visually stimulating, and it's worth a watch if you are a sci-fi fan. I get the feeling that most critics are either a) not fans of science fiction and/or b) miffed that the film wasn't screened for them beforehand. IMO, they need to lighten up a bit."

From the beginning it seemed like just another conspiracy movie, such as equilibrium or Orwell's 1984, so I said to myself; what the 'heck', those were solid movies anyway, therefor I preceded.\n\nThe turnout was, however, quite shocking. I would never imagine the whole idea behind setting was to warn people of how cruel cloning can get, by controlling population and choosing which members are actually appropriate to be a part of such tyranny. Aftewards I read in one of the reviews that whole idea of a movie was a remake, of MTV's cartoon, which seemed rather funny learning they are actually capable of such minimized-Hollywood-stereotype picture. Of course there was ever present romance between good and bad, adrenalin rising explosions, and the prevalence of the righteous, but all in all it was far from being obvious.\n\nMy compliments go to Charlize Therone as well. Not only has she proved her multi orientated talent to preform in any kind of movie genre, but she looks damn hot too. I would rate this movie 'a must see' for any sci-fi enthusiast."

The plot was along the lines of The Island and those types of movies with the characters being clones unknowingly as well as Kill Bill. The plot was alright but I think what made the movie was the action and all of the cool moves Charlize Theron, as well as the other characters, did. Throughout the whole movie I was leaning over to my friend saying, \"That was so cool!\" So if you want some awesome action scenes and two hot main characters you should definitely go see Aeon Flux."

The show was pretty racy, however most if not all of that raciness has been removed for this PG thriller. But the movie version maintains the spirit of the show, as our heroine jumps, runs, fights and shoots her way through a bunch of close calls with the enemy, the corrupt government of the city fortress in which she lives. Charlize Theron apparently did much of her own stunt work, and she got herself into incredibly lithe shape to play the lead character, although personally I would have preferred to see someone with a bit more personality play the role. Jolie comes to mind, for one. The secondary roles are of little matter here, as the film is all about Aeon and her desire to avenge herself on the killers of her pregnant sister. The film was shot in Berlin, of all places, and the look of the film screams DARK CITY and EQUILIBRIUM, while Aeon herself closely resembles the title character from CATWOMAN. If you liked any or all of those films, you likely will enjoy AEON FLUX, which at its heart is a trifle and quickly forgotten."

It wasn't a bad movie by any stretch, it merely didn't entertain me as much as it should have. I did have a few moments of glee when I saw some of the elements that WERE from the cartoon, but the story differed too greatly for my enjoyment. Aeon certainly looked the part facially, but she she had as much sexual tension with Trevor as a sack of wet potatoes. There was no chemistry between the actors and no underlying tension. Further, I found elements of the plot overly predictable and rather tired. If you're a fan looking for a faithful reproduction, don't look here.

Extremely quick cut action indicates to me that actors weren't that very skilled in the arts. It tries to be fast paced Matrix-style but just ends up as a sequence of one second frames.\n\nAs for eye candy, it's colors and the whole environment gives a good opportunity, and you see the intentions for sure - but it just doesn't work somehow. Maybe too much CGI or just lack of soul? And maybe that's the way to sum it up; a movie where they recycle shots(cause they do!) may not be expected to have too much of a soul!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Remember back in 1999, before the Y2K bust, when you saw the Phantom Menace trailer? Remember when you thought that was the greatest thing you had ever born witness to, and you assumed from it that the movie itself would be one of the finest works ever forged by the hand of man? That to see the movie itself would be to take part in a glorious history that would bring Star Wars to a new age? And then you saw the movie and started asking, \"What the hell was that?\" This happened to Aeon Flux. Only in reverse.\n\nThe trailer was put together by some suit in a Hollywood suite. It was designed to entice the kind of crowd that likes generic action movies starring hot chicks. Basically, the kind of person who would go see Resident Evil even though they had no idea it was based on a video game.\n\nThe movie was put together by some rather talented individuals. They were pulling from source material that was incredibly stylized cartoon animation, as well as some mind-screwing narrative. And I mean that in a good way ;) And they were able to pull off a live-action version of the cartoon quite well.\n\nThe people who watched the trailer and said, \"Hey, I want to see that,\" are exactly the kind of people who should NEVER see Aeon Flux. They can't appreciate it. The movie that the trailer described wasn't the movie that Aeon Flux was. And the audience that would have appreciated Aeon Flux on its merits was either repulsed by the trailer or are Aeon Flux cartoon zealots who cannot stand visual alterations necessary for such a conversion. And the latter group wouldn't have liked any kind of translation, so they're irrelevant.\n\nSo, the trailer ruined any chance of this movie doing well at the box office. So, what was the movie like? Very well done. The greatness of the Aeon Flux cartoon series, to me, was in the characters and in the narrative. And at this, the movie's conversion works very well. If you want to see the stylized visuals of the cartoon series, buy the series on DVD; you're not getting it from this movie.\n\nAt its core, Aeon Flux the film is a futuristic action movie with a plot. Not only does it have a plot, it has one that is constantly shifting. For the first hour, if not more, you will be left wondering who the bad guy is, why the bad guy is doing what he appears to be doing, and whether the bad guy is even bad at all? Now, the movie does a great job of explaining everything so that, by the end, you do understand the truth (this, btw, is one of its failings. The cartoon almost never let you know the whole truth by the end).\n\nAs an action movie, it's pretty good. However, some of the directing choices in certain fight scenes should perhaps have been considered more; there is a 1 on 1 fight between Aeon and another woman, and it's hard to follow exactly what is going on. Granted, this is the era of the ridiculous quick-cutting of fight scenes, so that is unfortunately to be expected. But even that is a problem in only one scene. Everything else action-wise seems to work pretty well.\n\nVisually, the movie works enough for me, but Aeon Flux purists will likely flee in terror. Charlize Theron in no way embodies the physical being of Aeon Flux, but she does an excellent job of embodying the spirit of Aeon. Likewise with most of the rest of the cast. I suppose that the movie could have been closer to the cartoon visually, but it's certainly good enough for me. And doing so might have been off putting for some who would have otherwise enjoyed the film.\n\nIf you're a fan of the narrative aspects of Aeon Flux, or if you're a fan of action movies but would like something more cerebral, give it a rental.\n\nOh, and any comparisons to Catwoman are flat-out wrong."

When an action-based fantasy movie with a touch a of science fiction in it fails to find an authentic way of presentation of its characters and their struggles, it naturally turns into a charade of funny demonstration. To put it simply, this is not even a bad movie, but a summary of it."

But it's fine for sci-fi fare, and very faithful to the *spirit* of Aeon Flux in many places. It would have been a great sci-fi film if they had just changed the names and filed off the serial numbers to protect the innocent. This is not an Aeon Flux film. It's a pretty decent science fiction film that is sort of inspired by Aeon Flux.\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nI would have liked to see them tackle the issue of the \"split city\" that was the whole point of the original series on MTV. But the ending, with the wall coming down, was just great. :) And it was fun to see the subplot about the Relical, which featured in the Herotodus File book that came out around the same time as the Flux \"talkies\" in 1995. As a fan of the original silent shorts on Liquid TV, I was pleased that this was made into a film at all. I just wish they hadn't changed so much."

The locations were outstanding and really gave the movie a real futuristic feel.\n\nI am a fan of the original Peter Chung animated series, and feel that this movie does the character and plot justice, even though Mr. Chung was disappointed in the movie.\n\nI really don't get some of the earlier criticism of the movie. This movie is every bit as good, if not better, than some of the current action figure movies such as Spiderman and Iron Man.\n\nSo if you are looking for a good science fiction movie with a consistent plot, good acting and visuals this one will work just fine."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really enjoyed \"Aeon Flux\". I was expecting to watch it for half an hour before turning it off bored, what with how it was trounced by critics. I'm happy to report I turned it off (out of boredom) a mere five minutes before it was over. It's better than most of the sci-fi action dreck out these days. Certainly better than the the last two \"Matrix\" movies. And a lot more interesting than the first two Star Wars movies, both of which had me yawning by the half-way mark.\n\nBASIC STORYLINE: Sometime in the future a virus kills off most people on earth. The survivors move into a walled city and live in relative peace for the next 400 years under the rule of some kind of dictator or monarch or something (but for a dictator he's an awfully nice guy). A group of rebels, Aeon Flux being one, seek to overthrow the current political regime. All kinds of sneaking around and double-crosses, and gun fights and stuff ensues.\n\nI always found the original \"Aeon Flux\" cartons dull and weird and nonsensical. Aeon herself was very sexy but it was never clear just WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON. Even at fifteen minutes long they strained my patience. I like the film much better. The ideas have been fleshed out and given a shape. The whole thing moves and breathes in a nice way.\n\nWithout divulging much, I will say the basic idea behind \"Aeon Flux\" is Eastern. By that I mean not Western. By that I mean it may be difficult for Westerners to fully grasp or appreciate the concepts at work. It involves the notion of reincarnation and the suffering of beings born again and again.\n\nI love the colors the director uses for this film. So vivid and bright and alive. Extremely delicate, like flowers. I like all of this. It's also a consistently inventive film. There are about twenty little visual inventions in this film that are really cool and fun.\n\nThe film has a couple of flaws. Aeon's best friend has hands instead of feet (whose idea was that??) Charlize Theron is a great actress but she seems strangely miscast as Aeon. She has the physique for the part but she seems too grave. Too serious. I think Charlize Theron is better in more serious roles. Also, some of the action relies on quick cutting instead of giving a clear idea of what is going on.\n\nHave to say, though, I was surprised by how good this was."

I'm not going to spoil it for you and I'm not going to go on a lengthy rant about what Hollywood does to material it adapts into movies. Finally I'm under no illusions that I'm a film critic. I've seen the animated shorts and liked them. I've seen the movie and wasn't impressed. Here's why:\n\n1. If you loved the animated Aeon Flux you won't find much in this to enjoy. Aside from some names of people and places and a general \"look\" to the characters and the buildings this isn't Aeon Flux. You won't find her here.\n\n2. If you are like me and you just \"liked\" the animated Aeon Flux and remember the show then it's not so bad. With no particular investment in the characters and places you can enjoy the few high points. This is standard Action/Adventure with lots of shooting and a few attempts at memorable lines thrown in from time to time. It's not the worst movie of this type I've ever seen but I doubt I'll remember much about it in a years time.\n\n3. If you have never heard of Aeon Flux or know nothing about the original material then this is probably going to come across as a run of the mill Action/Adventure movie that might come across as a little \"flat\" depending on how much you like movies where dozens of people fire thousands of rounds at one another but rarely hit anything. If this makes you happy then you might really like this movie. The formula is pretty obvious and most of the people in the theater will have figured out what's going on long before the characters on the screen get to the big secret. If you're a \"Guns we're cool!\" and \"Did you see that bomb go off/ Whoa!\" kind of viewer (not that there's anything wrong with that) then you won't be mad about the price of the ticket."

Some risks are simply too great.\n\nAeon Flux is one of the dumbest futuristic/dystopian/heroine- somersaulting-around-in-a-sprayed-on-spandex-thingy wastes of two hours I have seen. Flux (just saying it makes me chuckle at what the movie makers tried to do to me, as in, rhymes-with) is an old- fashioned 70s-sort of idiocy that reminded me, a bit, of John Boorman's Zardoz.\n\nIt actually wants to be taken seriously, but how am I supposed to do anything other than mutter \"jeez-louise\" when Frances McDormand pops up wearing a Julia Roberts fright-mane, another character shows off her surgically implanted hands where her feet were, and Theron, demonstrating athleticism instead of dramatic talent, looks as if she's suffering from a stunt injury?\n\nI saw Aeon Flux on the Scify channel a few days ago. I admire how it appears that the network was able to cram the movie into 88 minutes without losing any crappiness. I don't admire how a cynical piece of garbage like this could get green-lighted. The cynicism comes in the form of assuming that audiences would just flock to see a live- action comic book with Charlize Theron non-acting in a whole-body Speedo.\n\nIt's a decade since this movie came out; just enough time for the principals to forget their involvement. I'm not so lucky."

The writing and editing was not as tight as it could have been, but it is still crisp and fresh; and the film is all the more interesting because much of the plot is provided through images and frame composition, scene cuts and facial expressions, rather than dialogue. The crew aimed for \"organic\" technology inspired by plant life and nature. There were some really beautiful and inspired location choices in Berlin both architecturally and naturally which evoked an absorbing futuristic world. Across the board the acting is excellent, and even the small roles have great scenes."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was such a dog that I am sure someone was shot after it flopped. And so they should have been. Aside from ensuring Charlize Theron would don an increasingly ridiculous \u2013 but form fitting \u2013 series of outfits the plot was never going to be any better than banal; 'another virus has wiped out 99% of the population and the survivors live under the tight control of an oppressive regime'. Really? Again?\n\n'Outnumbered but determined rebels take on the oppressors, but find that perhaps not all that it seems. They turn to the mysterious leaders who pass them information for the truth'.\n\nSeriously? How is any of that going to ever be more than average?\n\nHere's what you will remember about Aeon Flux if you're lucky: - Charlize Theron's gratuitous side-boob and wacky loose strings sleepwear. - Her offsider having replaced her feet with hands \u2013 it's never effectively explained why. (Does she need feet/hand manicures? I assume she needs four gloves and no socks when it is cold.) - If you're really lucky = nothing. You'll repress any recollection of having seen this. But 'cause you gotta laugh, here are some things that might be worth pondering: - Why on top secret missions when she can't afford to be spotted does Aeon wear luminous white at night and black during the day? - Why in every future do people dress like absolute dicks, have ridiculous hairdos that went out of fashion in the 80s and walk around to a bad techno soundtrack.\n\nThat's about it. Aeon moves about like a video game character throughout the film even when there is no reason for it and they spend so long introducing everyone and clumsily getting things in order that by the time something finally happens you're either too confused or simply don't care.\n\nPut another way, the biggest drawback is that the filmmakers took this all seriously, a few 'boing' sound effects and a few net nerd jokes and this could be passed off as a bad MTV joke. But when the lead characters take everything dead seriously and all walk around spouting inane dialogue and looking perpetually confused, what chance does the viewer who remembered Aeon Flux as a cool 4 minute cartoon on telly have?\n\nAs a result Aeon Flux is like the rest of MTV to me these days, expensive looking, full of bright colours and pretty young people (Yeesh Charlise in the bodysuit!), loud, noisy and unnecessary.\n\nFinal Rating \u2013 4.5 / 10. Those that label Aeon Flux as 'the worst of' anything are wrong. There are worse movies every year. It just sucks."

Johnny Lee did a good job with his villain from a shade, a fanatic with greed for power, maybe in years this roles will be his trade mark... Film is fine directed with a good \"future\" atmosphere made with shots angles and appropriate scenography... To conclude: A good action film with fast but heartless story and with fine actors.

For the fans of the cartoon, the movie has tried to capture the same style and quirkiness however the sexual deviancy of the cartoons is far less pronounced in the movie.\n\nCharlize Theron despite looking not much like the original Flux, does quite a good job portraying the perverted and strong character of Aeon. Although I believe that she could of done with less dialogue.\n\nThe action scenes are superbly done and the visual styles of the movie is incredibly original as is the mood. This is unlike any action movie I've ever scene. It feels both stylish and artsy similar to the type of furniture you see at IKEA :P Overall it's definitely worth seeing.

With that in mind, I should say that the visuals were fantastic, the plot was somewhat very straight forward. Although,...at the beginning there is really no reason for the rebellion of these secret members....later on we learn what's wrong with the society.\n\nFrom a technical/genetic point of view, the plot is seriously flawed, as it is the case with The Island and many other such movies. Memories are not imprinted in our DNA. Long term memory is just a process of changes in release of biochemical molecules in the brain that have nothing to do with the DNA. Therefore, memories cannot be propagated via reproduction OR reproductive cloning. So, even if in the future humans can be cloned, their lifetime \"memories\" cannot.\n\nCharlize Therone was an unusual pick for this role, but I must admit I liked the depth that she brought to Aeon's character due to her own superior acting skills. Someone like Mila Jovovich, who has limited talent for acting in my opinion, always appears angry and without a soul in her roles. So, I disagree with someone who commented here that she should have played this role instead of Charlize. I was a bit prejudiced in watching this movie because I had Ultraviolet in mind, which I found to be much much worse than Aeon Flux- perhaps due to Mila's poor acting and unnecessary fury!\n\nOverall, this is not my favorite recent science fiction film, mostly because sometimes during the movie it is obvious that the creators have run away with the visuals and have left the plot lagging behind!! this causes the viewer to neglect and forget about the \"purpose\" of the movie and to just become stunned with the graphics. Which ultimately takes away from the effectiveness of the story-telling."

A movie where more or less all ambitions have failed and most of the time the ambitions are not even evident. Aeon Flux is unfortunately such a movie.\n\nI can see what the filmmakers wanted to do here, i really can. A good-looking fresh take on the superhero-genre, a comic-book adaption with style and flare. I see this as an attempt to go where Kurt Wimmers \"Equilibrium\" went. But this movie falls so shamefully short that it's an embarrassment.\n\nFirst of all the story is poorly explained and even when i think i get the hang of it, it's still completely without sense or logic. It's a mess of cloning, a repressive society and underground movements. I would seriously doubt the effectiveness of this government though. Considering that the human world is now only consisting of a single city spread out over a quite small space, and yet the authorities are unable to find the dissidents.\n\nAeon Flux, played by a Charlize Theron who isn't nearly as hot as she usually is although she spends most of the movie dressed in tight leather, is an agent for this resistance movement. How she got the superhuman strength and agility she possesses is never explained, but she jumps, kicks and fights with great intensity. The fight scenes i guess is what could have saved this movie. A weak storyline, poor character development and a non-existent logic to the whole thing can almost always be countered with a nice amount of violence. But here the action is just so poorly made that it fits right into the rest of the movie. People fly this way and that, there is kicking and shooting and none of it raises your pulse a single beat.\n\nThere are always a bunch of people that are going to tell you that crap movies like this one are \"a lot better than people say\". To me though this movie lived up to it's poor rumor completely. When i try to find positive points (i always do) i can think of only two. First of all the movie is not bad-looking. There are some nice sets (very good use of beautiful architecture) and the special effects are not bad. Second the actors are not all lousy although the characters and script they have to work with are so bad that it's hard to notice.\n\nMy recommendation would be: stay away.

The reason for this is, that the man kind is slowly trying to climb out of a pit caused by a disease that same 400 years ago. But there is something rotten with the government and Aeon is a part of a terrorist cell trying to over throw the power.\n\nVisusally speaking 'Aeon Flux' is very interesting. The city scape and design is very well made and the over all look is well executed. Also the action scenes are well made and are a pleasure to watch.\n\nNow plot wise the movie is a different matter all together. There isn't anything wrong with it as such, but it is so clich\u00e9 ridden, that it serves next to none surprises or aces in sleeves. The movie flows pretty much as you could expect of a movie like this. Also the length of the film could have been a tad longer, as now many things were just waiting to be fleshed out a bit more.\n\nWith a bit more effort 'Aeon Flux' could have been a lot better movie, but as it was MTV movie production maybe that wasn't even their goal. I can't say how much of the original there was brought in with the script, but I was surprised how serious the whole film was. I was expecting even a subtle humor that is present in almost every great action film, as that clearly was the main goal the direction was aiming for."

The way personal loyalties vs obedience to authority was worked over is a case in point for me.\n\nI can't comment on the original Aeon character, but then again, even comparisons to the quality of Blade Runner don't stand up for all people who have read and enjoyed PK Dick. However, Aeon has its has interesting elements, and for my money was better to watch than seeing the Matrix for the n'th time."

Yes it's not true to the cartoon series, yes its not 'original' as some say, but hey, this is a good action film. I am one of those that used to watch the Aeon Flux television series in the early-mid 90's and after seeing this film, there's seriously nothing wrong about it, I thought the 'twist' was pretty clever also. The only downside I thought was that the director didn't express the storyline effectively. With that story there could've been more emotion. The way it was directed just didn't make you 'feel' for the characters and didn't leave an impression that it should have. To sum up, its an enjoyable action flick using the 'Aeon Flux' title and characters, watch it without any expectations, it's a much better film then first expected."

The action was horrible, lacking excitement or intensity.\n\nPersonally, I blame the director, this movie wasn't told well. it had no visual contrasts and the performances were lull. I don't care about the cast, I'm a firm believer that a performance is more the character written, than the actor. Anyone could of played Aeon, they just needed to be tall, athletic, white and female.\n\nTo be blunt, this movie sucked.

Her target is Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), the leader of what's left of Earth. But before Aeon can pull the trigger, something strange happens. A memory is sparked of a previous life when she knew Goodchild. She discovers that for the past 400 years everyone on Earth has been infertile. The human race has carried on through an intricate system of cloning. Trevor tells her that he is near to finding a solution to the problem. But there are some who would have things stay as they are. Trevor Goodchild's brother, Oren (Jonny Lee Miller) has plans to overthrow Trevor to maintain the status quo. Aeon changes her mission - now she must protect Trevor, stop Oren, and end the cycle of cloning.\n\nI'm really starting to hate the modern brand of action movies. What happened to the good old days when it was all about shooting people and blowing things up? Why do filmmakers feel the need to hide their action movies behind a faux sense of intelligence? Despite all the weird flashback scenes, the annoyingly vague character motivations, and the intentionally muddled plot points, Aeon Flux is no smarter than any other action movie. In fact, all this pseudo-intellectual garbage does is confuse matters to the point the movie becomes incredibly dull. Scene after scene of people talking nonsense does not make for a good action film. And that's just what you get in Aeon Flux. Add to that some of the most uninteresting characters I've seen recently and you've got the makings of an infuriatingly boring movie. The worst offender in this regard has to be Jonny Lee Miller (though if truth be told, no one comes out looking good - and that includes Charlize Theron). Miller is so dry, so white bread, he's hardly menacing at all. Laughable would be a better description.\n\nAnd why do filmmakers today feel the need to make every action movie look like The Matrix? I'm no physicist or human physiologist, but people and things don't move and/or behave in nature like they do in these movies. There's a scene where Aeon is about to fall on sharpened blades of grass (oh, how clever). The way she holds herself just inches above the ground with nothing but the insides of her feet is impossible. I'm so tired of seeing this kind of thing.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'll rate Aeon Flux a 3/10."

But it's a little more interesting that that. A plague has reduced the human population to 5 million and they all now live in single hi-tech city. Furthermore, things aren't quite right in both the government and the people...\n\nI won't spoil where the plot goes, but the story that's revealed is pretty interesting. In fact, the special effects are pretty good too. However, the movie as a whole is a bit of a mess.\n\nJust 10 minutes into it, I was rejecting a lot of things. For example: giving an single person the task to bring down the entire surveillance system of a 25th century government. Ya - right. And then just do it while dressed ridiculously differently than everyone else and with face exposed and leaving fingerprints and DNA. I'd like to see someone do it today, let alone in 400 years and a small population.\n\nThat pretty much sums up the kind of thought the filmmakers seem to think is OK. Furthermore, there are other ideas pushed at the viewer towards the end as moralistic (if you agree with the lead character/writers) when they actually seem rash and wrong.\n\nIf you're a sci-fi fan and are willing to sit through some bad-movie-making in exchange for interesting ideas, you might like this.

Perhaps if I'd seen the original show, I would have thought more highly of it.\n\nThe characters in this film feel very fake, scripted with weak dialogue, and in general are not very moving. You don't feel much of an attachment with them, and half the time they're going about doing things but leaving you wondering just why and how. It almost feels like the cast was pulled out of Beverley Hills 91210... There are not many 'maturer' people in the cast, the leaders and most of the public in the film are all in their early twenties, having perfect hairdos that would naturally requires hours of maintenance every morning.\n\nOne of my main gripes is that you get the feeling the characters in the film know exactly what they're supposed to be doing, there is certainly a lack of spontaneity and the characters go about doing their thing as if they know exactly what they're doing, what they will face, and never show signs of trepidation and this may lead you to feel that the film is utterly surreal, scripted and poorly thought out. There are scenes that are a lot like ideas used frequently in a computer game, and it seems like a lot of inspiration has been drawn from tomb raider, but feeling a lot shallower.\n\nThere are certain touches to the film that excel, the city and scenes in the film are truly quite special. The character clothing, lighting and the various sites in the film are captivating and exceptionally well done...\n\nWhile that is a bonus, it doesn't really make up for it, as I too felt some of the cast selection was rather weak, it felt a lot to me like young adults trying to be serious and this I could not take seriously. The editing was really bad and particularly in some parts of the film, and there is noticeable jumping of the character around, while it's helpful to speed things up it just doesn't do much good for the continuity.\n\nA lot of the story could have been clarified, too..\n\nWhen you're watching a film and wondering how far into the film you are, and getting constant reminders that you're watching a story that's been badly executed, you actually feel sorry for some of the cast and the people that really did a top job on what is an otherwise mildly captivating film. See it if you're into pretty art, predictable action scenes and a little bit of a rather skinny storyline."

When it comes to the Flux on the movies we find that the beautiful look -added by Charlize Theron- left out the soul that Peter Chung give to Aeon, but it seems that Chung get himself flush out of Aeon Flux. Just a end movie credit names him as character creator. Also, say goodbye to the great stories you see in TV, if you are fan of the movie. The filmmaker team took a few ideas and make a construct of what they think will work fine in the box office. If you didn't know any of Aeon before, then you can see the movie as something new, probably in a corn-pop Sunday, but don't bother to sacrifice any other activity to see this movie. Nice storytelling, but the story taste soul less. Basic acting, but Theron looks gorgeous -as always- and a fight scene editing that doesn't let you picture what is really happening.

Very visually appealing and, despite a few plot twists, was easy and fun to follow. I had no idea where it was going to end up and I like that in a movie.\n\nCharlize was fabulous in the role. She was sexy, tough, vulnerable and simply a joy to watch. The others in the cast, especially Marton Csokas, were just as good (and made the movie even better) but it is clearly Charlize's vehicle.\n\nI enjoyed a lot of the filming techniques as I sometimes felt I was watching the graphics of a video game. I also, at times, almost felt I was playing the game. I found myself talking to the character suggesting certain courses of action. I even felt, when things did not go well, that I wanted to revisit a plot twist and change it. Like, I said, it was a fun movie.\n\nHighly recommend even to people who are not sci-fi fans.

        "review_detailed_main": "Aeon Flux is a prime example of a film in which the filmmakers decided on a look, and forgot about the rest of it. The film is supposedly based on a cartoon, and the Mtv logo that comes before the movie starts is very fitting as this film takes in all the flashy photography and silly action scenes that you would associate with the popular music channel. Actually, I think this sort of thing would work well as a cartoon, but as a film; it's laughable. We start off with a bit of back-story, which is the common 'virus has wiped out humanity' sort of thing and then we move on to a series of shots of the central location - a futuristic city inside an airtight dome - and it all looks rather nice. Everything is going well up until the lead character introduces herself, and we realise that like the back-story; we've seen all this before. The plot follows a mysterious assassin working for an organisation calling themselves 'the Monican', who hope to bring down the central rulers governing the city. However, as the agent infiltrates her target; several secrets about the founding's of the last city on Earth begin to emerge\u0085\n\nThere is a scene in this film in which our heroine finds herself in a jail cell. She escapes by whistling through the air vent, which causes a load of metal balls to spring up from somewhere and blow the door open. This scene sums the entire movie up, as the writers seem to think that the audience will either accept everything that is thrown at them, or somehow know why and how it has happened. Obviously, you have to expect some crazy inventions in a futuristic world; but everything just seems far too covenant. The lead actress is the Oscar winning Charlie Theron, who gives a dull and forced impression of the title character. Her performance relies largely on her good looks and lean form, however, and she does look the part. Support comes from Jonny Lee Miller, Pete Postlethwaite and Frances McDormand, all of which fail to make any kind of impression. The twist mid-through is well presented, although it's as unoriginal as the rest of the film. Despite the director's eye for beauty, which sees picturesque scenes set among blossom trees and in bright white rooms; none of it comes across with any artistic value as the action scenes are dull and uninspired, while the script lacks any real characterisation. Overall, Aeon Flux is simply a bad film, and one which I cannot recommend."

AEON FLUX has an opening caption saying in 2011 a virus has killed 99& of the world's population . That would mean out of a population of almost 7 Billion the world's population would instantly shrink to 70 million people scattered across the planet . This wouldn't be anywhere enough to maintain a civilization that we know today . Of the 70 million who have survived many would fall by the Darwinian wayside with the survivors living in self sufficient communities similar to those seen in the Bronze age . Eventually things would progress and trade across the continents would follow then the cruel necessity of industrialization and eventually a world like we have today . However this would take many centuries not just over 300 years as seen in AEON FLUX . If I remember this illogical process of apocalypse quickly followed by technological regeneration is one of the major flaws of THE HUNGER GAMES\n\nThat said you very quickly realise internal logic is not a priority with this film . You might notice that one of the production companies is MTV Films and that tells you all you have to know . The gossamer thin premise involves mankind being crushed under the fascist jackboot of a dynasty and it's up to a rebel called the Monicans to defeat them . Shades of BLAKES 7 or LOGANS RUN perhaps but at least they developed plots that the audience understood . This movie doesn't even try to paint a convincing picture of the future because everything is about hot chicks in general and Charlize Theron walking in slow motion or being involved in breaking bad guys necks whilst wearing skin tight PVC . Everything about the film screams MTV as it jumps from one under explained action set-piece to the other along with blink and you miss it editing and in your face camera movement . One feels slightly about the collective intelligence of humanity that this film has a relatively low rating at the IMDb"

Yes, Charlize Theron looks great in the outfits and is a good athletic, if somewhat one dimensional, action heroine. The futuristic city and costumes look good, but what really interested me was the performance of New Zealand actor Marton Csokas playing Trevor Goodchild.\n\nCsokas managed to squeeze every last intensely romantic drop out of his underwritten role. As he said in an interview about the film - the way he performed the role was to play Romeo to Aeon's Juliette. It is always a pleasure to see actors do good work in films where you don't expect them to. For me, Csokas was definitely the best and most interesting thing in an otherwise somewhat forgettable film."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 2011, a deadly virus kills 99 percent of the Earth's population. Four centuries later, the entire human population, around five million people, live in a single walled city, Bregna, while the rest of the planet has been reclaimed by nature. Bregna is ruled by an autocratic government headed by the Goodchild family, descendants of the scientist who eventually found a cure for the virus. Opposition to their rule is growing, however, and a group of rebels known as the Monicans has sworn to overthrow them. The title character \u00c6on Flux is a member of this group, a young woman with advanced athletic and martial-arts skills. She is tasked by the group's leader, the Handler, with a mission to kill Trevor Goodchild, the ruler of the city.\n\nSo is this a \"government bad, rebels good\" piece of sci-fi along the lines of \"Star Wars\"? Not quite. The real situation is more complex than that. \u00c6on discovers that Trevor is something quite other than what she had believed him to be and that the Monicans are being manipulated by a group within the government which want Trevor dead so that his more hardline brother can seize power. She also makes some startling discoveries about the origins of Bregna and of its population, including herself.\n\n\"\u00c6on Flux\" is a film which has come in from a lot of criticism on this board, in the press and elsewhere, much of it coming from devotees of the American animated television series on which it was based. Even its star, Charlize Theron, does not seem to have liked it very much and Peter Chung, creator of the original animation, seems to have disowned it. I have never seen the TV series- as far as I am aware it was never shown in Britain- so I am not in a position to make comparisons, but my view is that the film is not that bad.\n\nI must admit that I liked Theron better here than I did in the very overrated \"Monster\" from two years earlier, the film for which she unaccountably won a Best Actress Oscar. \"\u00c6on Flux\" is not the sort of film for which the Academy hand out Oscars- science fiction is not their favourite genre- but Theron makes a cool, stylish \u00c6on, psychologically more complicated than your standard sci-fi hero or heroine. She is someone who has to reassess her entire world-view when she discovers that the cause to which she has given her life is essentially based upon a lie and that the man she has been ordered to kill, far from being an evil tyrant, is himself a well-intentioned idealist and, moreover, someone with whom she is starting to fall in love. The lovely Charlize copes well with the challenge of portraying such a complex figure. (I would have preferred it if she had kept her trademark blonde hair, but she had to become a brunette, apparently to make her look more like the \u00c6on of the cartoon series).\n\nIn 2005 the concept of a deadly viral pandemic must have seemed like a tired sci-fi cliche, the noughties equivalent of all those nuclear Armageddons from the Cold War era. Since the Covid outbreak of 2020, it is starting to look a lot more scary. The film also taps into modern concerns about genetic engineering and government conspiracies; it may be an action thriller, but even action thrillers can ask pertinent questions. \"\u00c6on Flux\" is never going to be regarded as one of the great science-fiction classics like \"Forbidden Planet\", \"Planet of the Apes\" or \"Blade Runner\", but when you consider how many dreadful films the genre has given rise to, you realise that it could have been a lot worse than it is. 6/10."

Of course, this is what you would expect, given the incredible cast and direction.

The film isn't really a blockbuster action flick, but more like a really bizarre film noir with a lot of guns and flipping.\n\nFans of the show certainly won't be disappointed, nor will people who just love sci-fi in general. The acting is solid and so is the story. The thing that may put non sci-fi fans off from it is that it's not a \"Matrix\" style action flick where guns are blazing every five minutes to cover up the plot holes (although the film's climactic standoff does get the adrenaline rushing.) On top of that, there's no bones about it, this movie is just plain weird. All of the rebels have crazy implants that let them do stuff like heal gunshot wounds with skin from their neck, everybody's monitored by a liquid surveillance system, an oh yeah there's this zeppelin with tentacles floating about the city.\n\nNot that I'm saying there's anything wrong with those things. In fact all of those things make Aeon Flux a dazzling spectacle to enjoy, and would probably be better enjoyed if it weren't going up against Narnia and King Kong."

There are a group of rebels fighting to bring down the dictatorship, ie Trevor Goodchild, and Aeon Flux is the most gifted of the rebels.

She can perform all kinds of flips and has superhuman strength as well as have this giant black eyeball she can bring up and see tiny particles floating in water.\n\nShe discovers a conspiracy as to why certain woman are killed by the government. And because she won't kill Goodchild, she is now a target. The parts with the Handler made little sense to me.\n\nSpecial effects were OK, but nothing outstanding.

        "review_detailed_main": "99% of humanity has been wiped out by a virus; now, 400 years later, some five million people live in the only remaining city on the planet, headed by the benevolent Goodchild family. A band of rebels, wishing to overthrow the Goodchild dynasty, sends an assassin named Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) to kill Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas). But Aeon finds that things are a little more complicated than as first surmised. Turns out there are mysterious things afoot, and when Aeon learns this, the rules and her mission change dramatically.\n\nSuperstylish and straightforward, the movie is an extension of an old MTV animated short. It's a lot of fun to watch, and even the plot isn't boggy or otherwise incomprehensible. And that's saying something, because so often these movies tend to have some kind of intentionally murky plot, the better to distract people from the fact that it's badly written. This film doesn't quite perform that little parlor trick; in fact, even though the special effects are the main attraction, the storyline does stand up to close scrutiny.\n\nTheron, as usual, is fantastic; she brings spirit and panache to a role that would have been much less effective with a straight-ahead action femme. She comes across to the viewer as commanding, strong, and mentally and physically tough. In short, an outstanding performance by a wonderful actress.\n\nShe doesn't get much in the way of support, but it's not really because the other actors aren't as talented; the film is, after all, called Aeon Flux for a reason. Csokas and Jonny Lee Miller as Trevor's brother are both a grade or so better than bland. They're not particularly colorful characters. Sophie Okonedo, as Flux's compatriot Sithandra, fares a little better, but her role is even smaller.\n\nThe visual effects in the film are a real delight, particularly the land around the inner part of the city, where the reigning family lives; there's supersharp grass, trees that fire upon intruders, and so on. Inventive, even mesmerizing, each scene is brilliantly woven with the next, creating a tapestry of oh-my-goodness images.\n\n(Side note: The group for which Aeon works is called the Monicans. Now, that can't be related to American pop-political culture, can it?)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Although I was a fan of Aeon flux and own the complete animated series, I was hesitant to see this film in theaters as I heard and read so many horrible reviews. Normally if reviews are great to mildly mediocre, I check the movie out for myself, but the ratings from 1-10 that IMDb have given to this plot are quite ridiculous and relatively unfair. After finally viewing this movie for myself, I'm ashamed to have listened to the ratings and reviews of my fellow peers. When I looked at the votes on this movie, many were 10, and many were 1. This is why this movie got such a mediocre rating. IT would appear that some people who weren't expecting a movie that wasn't spoon fed a coherent, well-structured plot within the first 10 minutes couldn't handle watching the movie through, or at least keep an open mind long enough to delve into plot before writing it off as horrible. I fear that some people feel foolish when they don't comprehend or understand something, be it plot, storyline, or otherwise. Rather than trying to figure out what they don't understand, they become offended that they don't comprehend it at first glance and thereby rave about how horrible it must be (to give themselves closure and not feel inadequate). Such was the early cases of movies such as 12 monkeys and Matrix. These are the same folks that walk out on credits, walk out ten minutes into a movie because \"they don't get it\" or \"its not funny\", fall asleep half way through movies with any form of character development or dialog (without an explosion going off every 5 minutes or someone showing their breasts in a scandalous scene). These people are fans of many genres, its not to say that they are incompetent, immature, or have bad tastes. But it is to say that they are a bit biased and ignorant. The problem with Aeon flux is that it combines a dramatic mystery with a popcorn action flick. What we have is children and huge popcorn ADD ridden action buffs that don't know what the hell is going on between explosions, and snooty film critics uninterested in trying to utilize their pompous minds to dissect the plot long enough to realize that its not just a bunch of random futuristic hogwash and explosions that they can snoot their noses to and claim to be somewhat of a ripoff of \"cat woman\" or \"i robot\".\n\nWhat I'm saying is: While this movie may not be something that you're used to, are you truly doing it justice with votes within 1-5. That being said, have any of you ever seen a movie that truly deserved a rating that low? Movies that have the feel of B movies but had the budget and acting talent to be so much more. I found this movie to be very inventive, the graphics and action crisp, and the plot full of twists and quite complex. Even so, if one took the time to pay attention (sorry ocd/add moviegoers) to the general storyline of the movie long enough to release your biases and expectations as to what you think a good movie should be or what should be happening in the plot; you might just find yourself enjoying this film and becoming interested with its unique storyline and character development. This film, like memento, matrix, 12monkeys,fightclub, Is not meant to go down smoothly, it is meant to make you think, to pay attention, to appreciate every scene and piece together the plot rather than having a generic regurgitated script unfolding before you. It is meant to take you out of your comfort zone and think outside the box, to push the envelope. Come on guys, those of you who claim that its completely worthless, is there truly nothing you can appreciate about this film? The budget was only 50 something million? Compared to ridiculous budgets in the 200 millions given to movies like x-men 3 \"final stand\". An ironic name for a movie that spent so much time trying to hint at sequels rather than work on closure from the first two films or a little character development in the new characters introduced. (not that I'm saying that movie is bad, but thats an entirely different topic)."

Let's look strangely calm and collected while we are running for our lives! Yay!\" The storyline in general wasn't all that interesting. They presented the plot so confusingly that you really didn't understand until at least halfway through. I believe in subtility, but not tell the viewers and make them guess what is happening doesn't do as well.\n\nThe whole thing was just not well written. The theme of the story weren't presented until the very end. It seemed like basically throwing it in at the end like, \"Oh, this is why we told you this great big story and made it all confusing,\" which completely devaluized the movie itself.\n\nWhat I did really enjoy, though, were the visuals. They were intriguing and well-edited, and vastly fitting for the epic adventurous movie they were trying to present. If it weren't for them, I might've fallen asleep.\n\nOverall, this movie had a lot of potential for the epic it bragged. However, I feel it's a mainly faulty script that made it go awry.

With Aeon Flux, no matter how much it stayed true to the source material, is not visual stunning. In fact it's not a lot of things, good is being the prime example. I must ask this question though, what is it with Best Actress winners doing the most horrible pieces of crap right after their Oscar win? Swank, Berry and here we have Theron. Is it some kind of code they must take?\n\nThe film is not as big as it could have been or wanted to be. It has an epic scope written all over it, but comes up really short in it's delivery. The film opens with the usual sci/fi fare, with text written on the screen explaining to us what happened to lead us up to these events. Is this a requirement now for every sci/fi film? It's cool ideas within the plot are neat, but fail to capitalize with anything else, are get dragged down with the rest of this heap.\n\nThe film is a short one, clocking in at a whopping 90 some odd minutes. It's as if they just gave up half way through the film and decided to end it as soon as they can, this is evident in the poor acting, directing and overall feel of the film.

The martial arts are uninspired and lack anything that would make the lead character dangerous. Sure there is a scene or two were the visuals do seem good, but given what the source material is, they could have done so much more.\n\nI found myself rolling my eyes at the horrible dialogue given by the horrible actors. Marton Csokas, who you may remember as \"THAT GUY\" from xXx, The Bourne Supremacy and Kingdom of Heaven brings the film down so much with his monotone voice projection that you laugh at everything he says and does. Theron seemed to be only interested in the check that came her way and the fact that she got to look good after being uglied up for Monster.\n\nSkip this sci/fi lite film, it takes good talent and wastes them (McDormand, Postlethwaite and yes even Theron). All the action scenes are juvenile, the acting horrendous and the script laughable. Pass this one when you see it sitting on the video stand and thank god that you will never have to watch it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Boy, seems this film is getting dogged by critics, the fact they didn't allow it to be viewed by critics before release, (which is far more often then not a very bad sign), however not here in my opinion.\n\nLook... if your interested in this kind of film at all, you'll probably like it. Yet it was a two pronged fork for me. Meaning, at times it seemed I was watching a decently budgeted Sci-Fi flick. Yet at other times, it seemed it was a Sci-Fi Channel wanna-be-a-bigger-film.\n\nThe fight scenes...a let down. Charlize didn't pull it off and the directer obviously didn't believe in her or a bigger budget for the fight sequences. Far too much quick cut editing during the fights to cover up the weakness of them. However all together, the action wasn't too awful bad.\n\nThe STRONGEST point of this film to me... the STORY. It actually had a pretty good story. Not as graceful most of the time telling it as it could have been however quite interesting and overall done well. In addition, the creativity of the plot, gadgets, background and conceptual design are well worth mentioning.\n\nOne stickler to me was the acting of Marton Csokas, (Trevor). I like this guy however it seems when he plays 'nice' or 'sympathetic', he doesn't sell if for me, least not in this film. He's a strong presence on screen and I look forward to seeing more of him yet in this role I just didn't feel it from him when he turned to the good guy.\n\nSo with some of the problems of this film, I'd guess they would weigh more toward the director, Karyn Kusama, as there are too many common denominators that could have been far better done yet for some reason were not. Instead of getting someone who's directed only one other film, Girlfight 5 years prior, they should have invested a little more for a director with the caliber that could have made this film much closer to what it 'should and could' have been.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this film. Yet if you have an expensive pair of shoes with dirt all over them, it's hard to see the shine it could have. Even though muddied, it's a good film yet again, it could have shined far more than it did. Too bad too."

This film is quite flashy, high on style, and has some excellent set design. Among the stylized violence, bizarre sexual overtones, and great action set pieces, there is a very interesting plot here. Its a shame the film looks as if it was cut to ribbons in order to receive a PG-13, thank you Hollywood for once again conforming to a younger audience! (If this happens with the Silent Hill film that is currently in the works, I will boycott Hollywood, and get many, many people to join me, trust me I know a lot of people.) From the evident cuts in this film, it looks as if much violence was cut, including the scene in the trailer with the double machine guns! Why? Simply because Hollywood sucks, and will continue to, as seen with every remake that is in the works. This film is definitely a fast moving, intelligent film, but the fact remains that it looks as if its been cut, badly. Heres hoping to a directors cut DVD!"

I have to say that,given my rating,I wasn't really knocked-over by this,but I am willing to acknowledge that perhaps this is due to my lack of real running knowledge about the MTV series and comic book.\n\nHundreds of years into the future,in a walled-society that traced back to a vague \"industrial disease\" that killed off 90 percent of the human population back in the 21st century. This society,once Utopian,had now grown restless with rebels who wished to leave the city and spread out,who were in turn treated as menaces,thus starting an endless war between the Goodchilds(descendants of the man who both created a cure for the disease and the society for which they live)and their followers,and the resistance.\n\nAmong the resistance is a long-legged,attractive and athletic woman(Theron,who can act,but here is just inserted to be merely eye-catching and sympathetic)who is-of course-the title character. As she tries to get closer to the truth as to how and why she is in this war,she discovers she has some sort of bond with none other than the leader of the enemy himself,Trevor Goodchild(Marton Csokas).\n\nA decent spate of scenery chewing from Jonny Lee Miller(another great actor,Pete Postelthwaite is almost an afterthought here) and vividly colorful scenes and photography make this show certainly palatable,but I'm afraid if you're either not too familiar with the series or are a stickler for Sci-Fi that ISN'T wrapped around some rather neat and tidy plot concepts,you're probably gonna come away from this film feeling flat. But I suppose I could say in its defense that maybe,if this show's concept intrigues you at all,to see it for yourself and you be the judge."

The dialog was strange, the characters were strange, generally, just a show one watches if they enjoy weird sci-fi. I think the movie was done well, especially because it focused on strange characters, esoteric costumes, body movements and scenery. Nothing had a real feel to it, which might make one question the believability of the movie (many movies having bad CG), but the movie did such a great job of portraying the weird, it took my attention away from any plot holes or the like. I think with what they had to work with, the movie was good. That, and Charlize Theron is incredibly beautiful."

Charlize is one of the world's most beautiful women and would be a perfect video action figure actress, but for this I don't know, she didn't work for me. Maybe it was just the movie, I did however really enjoy the sharp grass sequence. The effects were pretty cool and very much for Matrix lovers.

I was impressed as an art student at the set designs and locations where they shot. The movie also keep true to Peter Chung(Matriculated from the Animatrix, The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury and more) style. It really felt that it was like watching anime at times with the terrific style. But for the story, I felt that the story was great, it had several turns and no plot holes like some movies do. I was pleasantly surprised and the story kept me guessing what was the back story and how did things come to be. It also makes you think, what if the elements of the story could come true, or maybe they're already happening...? So if you'd like to see a solid movie with a great plot that makes you think and entertains you, then see this movie. One other thing, Charlize Theron did a wonderful job portraying Aeon. She's strong, smart and sexy without being too sexualized."

For those of you who have not seen the series this is a very well made action sci-fi movie with a decently deep plot. Think a watered down matrix combined with a watered down 2001 ASO.

The action toward the end of the film was hardly engaging either, despite the film starting off with an action-oriented mindset and some interesting ideas. The worst thing about the film was the romance incorporated into the film toward the end of the movie, and its explanation that the romance held in terms of significance in the story.

If that is what the future will look like i cant wait to live in it hehe.\n\nThe acting of this movie is top notch but sadly Charlize Theron looks out of place playing a hard hitting,tough heroine, something that only one or 2 women of her beauty have been able to achieve (Milla Jovovich being the prime among them), her out-of-placeness had definitely affected this movie. Special mention goes again to the 2 villains and Marton Csokas in particular who was definitely the best actor in this film. I was not to happy with the casting of Sophie Okonedo as the other assassin as well.In fact the overall casting of the movie was mediocre.\n\nThe movie also lacks in the department of the big action scenes and the end again left a lot more to be desired.\n\nThe best part of the movie indeed was the middle of the movie where Aeon enters the enemy fortress and is captured and then escapes.\n\nThe science fiction of the movie was interesting but also left us with a lot of plot holes.\n\nThe effects as expected were first rate and i really loved the scene where the steel balls help her escape.\n\nThe movie also has very few funny one-liners (but the ones that are there including the non-funny ones were great) and overall this movie lacked humour which may have been on purpose.\n\nThe background sound were run of the mill and again could have definitely been better.\n\nThis movie may be predictable but its definitely not boring, the visual brilliance, the interesting fiction, the beautiful actress and the handful of action scenes keep you interested throughout this short movie.\n\nGood time-pass if you are an action-sci-fi fan but don't expect much."

The plot twists are all obvious but if you can forgive the characters being a little slow on them that's not a big problem for the film. Visually the film is excellent and the action is good too. The dialogue and acting is all pretty reasonable. So if your after a bit of excitement and a good visual experience you won't be disappointed. However, if your after a clever sci-fi film that makes you think, you probably should avoid it.\n\nI think that explains the surprisingly low voting this film is getting.

That's the only way I could explain such a low rating. Charlize does an excellent job in the role of Aeon, and portrays the adept assassin, as well as the troubled citizen, very well.

Great settings and fight sequences were marred by perhaps the flattest, dullest performances this year, a poor ending, lack of character and substance in the script and unnecessary betrayals of the characters. None of the actors delivered particularly memorable performances (save the Keeper guy, who was old and dressed in a weird suit, whose eerie deliveries made his performances pretty good), and Trevor Goodchild was so unbelievably dull and forgettable that the bloke who played him should be shot. This film has great ideas, but they need to be entwined well into the story, unlike on this film. Along with a total lack of any character, you really don't identify with any of them, including Aeon, and by the end of the film, you don't really care whether they live or die. It just didn't have character, like \"I, Robot\", and lacked hugely in substance and suspense, like \"The Matrix\". This film should have been so much better. It may have had an Oscar winning lead actor and an evidently big budget, but it really didn't cut the cheese, and ended up as a rather sub-par action flick. The fact that a virus killed 99% of the world's population was revealed in a way that shows that nobody really cared about that and just wanted to get on with the eye candy scenes.\n\nBut there are also good things about this film. It is without a doubt stunning to look at, and includes fight sequences that surpass even those of \"The Matrix\" in skills and thrills. A little-known director has done a truly huge achievement in these amazing fights. And the effects are amazing, and the film will not bore you in any way. However, there should have been more action sequences, and they were slightly over-the-top in parts. But this only makes it better. However, the movie-going public want more than just carnage - they want meaning and talent in their films, and aside the beautiful looks, there really is little else to be offered by this film. The boring, rubbish performances and repetitive, inexperienced script hamper a film that could have been great.\n\nIt would be wrong to call this film a disaster of epic proportions - it is a beautifully made and put together film, with a fast pace and great fights. But if the actors had actually cared about their roles, thus making us care more for them, this film could have been better. Much better. This film is not going to win Charlize Theron her second Oscar, and it certainly won't get the bloke who played Trevor Goodchild any offers - he was absolute doggy-dos in this film. He didn't care when his life disappeared before his eyes. On the whole - Aeon Flux is a definite one to be reckoned with in eye-candy terms, but in terms of depth and character, it fails to engage. 5/10"

The four have a tense and deadly confrontation, and have to play it without proper buildup. Probably, they should have had original writer Peter Chung become more involved with the feature's script.

        "review_detailed_main": "Way back in the 90s MTV ran a nice little cartoon series call Aeon Flux where we were in a future where most people are dead and the military rules with an iron hand. Aeon is the scantly clad people's hero constantly fighting against the evils of chairman Goodchild who is sometimes even on her side. Of course there is a lot of fighting and a lot of death.\n\nWell now we are in the age of the new Aeon Flux which is all live action and a slight bit different. This one takes place in the future with very few surviving people where many are mysteriously disappearing. A group of rebels called the Monocans are trying to assassinate the leader of the ruling group (Trevor Goodchild). Well things get quite complicated as they don't go as planned and thus the fun begins.\n\nAeon Flux is a futuristic movie that is quite different from many other future type movies in the sense that the background seems quite different and the feel is different. Unfortunately it doesn't quite have the same feel as the Animated series. The Plot is a fairly decent one and it makes for a fun movie. The Acting quality isn't overly good but not terrible either. Visually it is by far the most pleasing aspect as the architecture and costume design are very well done. As far as Sci-Fi Action Pieces Go Aeon Flux is a fairly good film but nothing to run out and buy."

        "review_detailed_main": "1st watched 8/6/2006 - 5 out of 10(Dir-Karyn Kusama): OK tale of a supposed perfect future world with rebels like Aeon Flux trying to prove otherwise. Aeon, played by Charlize Theron, is charged to remove the power at hand, Chairman Trevor Goodchild, played well by Martin Csokas, but is unable to do so and starts to learn more about herself, her past and the truth of what the current world consists of while hanging out with Mr. Goodchild. Things become more complex when a power-hungry brother tries to remove the current Chairman so he can reign and the rebels start hunting Aeon sensing that she's defected to the other side. There is some nice sets of the colorful new world and a story that keeps you interested, but Theron doesn't seem suited for this type of role and her weakness in the lead smothers what could have been a good movie. A well-intentioned attempt is made to make the story more important than the action but it doesn't quite give us enough to hold the movie together as a complete entity."

This is another middle of the road movie your going to see on peoples shelves from time to time, if they like Theron.\n\nStrengths: Nice Flow of events. The plot truly unraveled without becoming to stagnate, predictable, or confusing. After the first major plot twist I found myself predicting it wouldn't be the last. I'm never wrong. There are also decent special effects. You won't find any cheesy Catwoman/Blade2 computer crapola. Also my date enjoyed it, so that's a plus.\n\nWeaknesses: Where's the in depth character progression? I found myself unable to relate to main characters that were having life altering revelations. Who are these people? The intro was one like Underworld's brief narrated one. However, Underworld had one redeeming characteristic that this movie falls entire to short of. Kate Beckinsale wrapped in the most seductive skin tight leather I've ever seen. Theron's outfit made her shoulders look broad and wasn't the eye candy I was hoping for. There's really nothing to come back to see. Other than the plot, this movie is just a run of the mill action."

I no longer go into movies that were taken from Comic books, Graphic Novels, Animations, or Video Games with high expectations because I have had really high expectations previously only to be disappointed, then later came to the conclusion that some of the movies were actually pretty good, just not as good as they could have been. So I didn't go into this one with high expectations, I was just hoping they wouldn't blow it, but they did blow it. They took an original edgy intriguing story and characters and homogenized it into some mythical commercial movie template. They tried to turn the push/pull relationship between Aeon, and Trevor Goodchild(the villain in the Animation)into a 'love story' and Devillianized Trevor. They made up the envious little brother as the bad guy and put Trevor as a victim They also changed other things for no apparent reason like no monitors, instead everything is reflected on water? WHY? the weapons when Aeon and Sathandra were changed from mechanical to biological? The movies was 'mainstreamed' enough from the original animation to make it not nearly as interesting as the the original Animation, leaving a hum drum sci-fi that doesn't really peak the interest of the Sci-Fi fans, and certainly didn't capture the interests of the mainstream movie go'ers(reflected in the fact it was a 30 million dollar loser at the box office). I kept waiting for it to get really good but it just never did. Congratulations Hollywood on blowing another good story.\n\nThis is what happens when you take a great original edgy SCI-FI story and 'change it to be more mainstream' you alienate the SCI-FI genre fans, the Aeon Flux Fans, and you failed to capture mainstream appeal, Congratulations to the producer/director/writers you blew it on all accounts."

I see that a lot of people have already keyed in on many of the points I wanted to make, so I'll only touch lightly on those and focus on some others.\n\nThe production values were great.\n\nThe cast was great.\n\nThe special effects were great.\n\nIt's worth seeing the movie once on a big screen just to take in those aspects of it. It's a technical marvel.\n\nThe overall movie, however, was skeletal. There was very little meat in this movie.\n\nThe TV series was this way, too. But the TV series worked because in each episode, we were treated to various non sequitur sights of weird technology or odd behaviors (remember the disclaimer that always came on before each episode?) which filled in the gaps in the otherwise simple plot for the episode.\n\nThe movie treats us to a few of these non sequiturs, but mostly on the technological side, not on the behavioral side. They needed to inject a lot more of both in order to fill in the gaps in the story. It would have made the movie work a lot better. The same trick that made the series work would have made the movie work, too.\n\nAs a true \"Aeon Flux\" fan, I was expecting a lot of the non sequiturs in this movie, and I was left feeling empty when I walked out.\n\nIf I had to guess, I would say that the makers of the movie got scared and erred on the side of conservatism when translating the story from the animated TV version to the live action movie version. The movie version tries too hard to explain Aeon's world and circumstances in concrete terms. The TV series just presented her world and left it up to the viewer to take it all in and make sense of it.\n\nTo sum it all up: Unrealized potential."

It seems to be more Interested in Fashion and Fights, both Highly-Stylized and Frenetic to keep the Audience Distracted from the Vagueness of it all.\n\nThe Movie is Easy on the Eyes just like Aeon (Charlize Theron) but is Lacking Something, that is to say, almost Everything that makes this Sort of Thing Entertaining. It's Shallow, Plodding, Confusing, and Dull most of the time and might be more Accessible to those Familiar with the Series.\n\nIt's Not Much Fun, and Fails to Capture that Sci-Fi, Action, Modern Vibe that it is assumed was its Goal.

Some of it was so clich\u00e9 and unnatural, one would never believe real people spoke that way. As far as editing goes, though it was long, some parts of the plot were not explained or ironed out. Yes, some producers like to leave a little mystery for contemplation at the end. But it's obvious to me that major portions of the plot needed to be developed for continuity.\n\nMost science fiction/fantasies suffer from bad storytelling these days and no bells and whistles can lift them from mediocrity. With that said, effects were great as usual, but give me great storytelling that develops characters, builds to a climax, and takes the audience on an emotional roller-coaster, ala Star Wars (the first one made), Lord of the Rings, etc. I'd say wait for the video."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was actually a fan of the cartoon on liquid television long before the movie was even a thought.\n\nCritics did indeed write this off too soon. I have to say that the theater's are the real culprits in weather a movie succeeds or fails these days . When it costs 28 $ for 2 people to see a movie that they can wait and buy on DVD for the same price there is a problem and I think people are seeing that math.\n\nAeon Flux is one of those little surprises that I like. I wasn't expecting a whole lot as the original cartoon series wound up with Aeon dying horribly in almost every episode. I think part of the allure of the short cartoons that were on liquid television was the fact that we never really knew what Aeon was fighting , or if she really was the good guy ... that kept us watching to learn more ...\n\nI think I only saw perhaps 2 of the half hour episodes that were later released.\n\nThe film itself is good ... a twisted and at times hard to follow plot , but one that fits together later in the film. I could likely have done without some of the \" Ooh lets get a shot of as much of Charlise's body that we can legally get away with \" pieces of the film. I don't remember the cartoon having Aeon walking around in a beaded bathing suit . Although she was a little risqu\u00e9 with her PVC looking outfits.\n\nThe action is well done and the effects are, though not totally ground breaking, still very gripping. I think my favorite 2 are Xathandra's \"Legs\" and the marbles that Aeon so lovingly calls her \" Boys\" .\n\nI don't want to spoil it , rent the movie and see for yourself ... it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be and there is way worse ... look what they did to \"Ultra Violet\" . Another tragedy all it's own.\n\nI think people expect way too much from this film with no reason ... keep in mind this thing started as a bunch of fillers MTV used to break in between commercials ... although they were good ... most were less than 2 minutes ..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Aeon Flux is set some 400 years in the future, long after a 2011 plague decimates virtually the entire population of the planet Earth. Only a last minute cure has saved any of humanity. Earth's one remaining city \u0097 Bregna \u0097 is perfectly landscaped. Its citizens are uniformly well taken care of. And yet there's ugliness beneath the surface as the government itself is suspected of kidnapping and worse.\n\nA secret group of rebels calling themselves Monicans is working to both mitigate and expose government wrongdoing. Among the Monicans' most stalwart and skilled operatives is Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron). Though she maintains some semblance of normalcy as she visits with her sister, Una (Amelia Warner), she's also covertly in contact with her Monican \"handler\" (Frances McDormond). As she completes yet another assignment successfully, she returns to her usual life only to find tragedy has struck in her absence.\n\nNow angrier than ever, Aeon is grimly satisfied to get her next assignment: the assassination of government head, Chairman Trevor Goodchild (Martin Czokas). Along with his brother, Oren (Jonny Lee Miller) and a small committee of others, Goodchild maintains the walled city with an iron fist. While most don't even know enough to question the beneficence of the government, Aeon and the other Monicans know too much.\n\nIn short order, Aeon finds herself a partner (Sithandra, played by Sophie Okonedo) headed into the very seat of government. Overcoming the many security measures of the complex, however, turns out to be less of a problem than the knowledge not everything is as it seems. When some of Aeon's most worrisome questions are finally answered by a man known only as The Keeper (Pete Postlethwaite), her perspective is changed forever. But surrounded by enemies and with a mission still to complete, what can Aeon do about it? After an Oscar\u0099 win for Monster and a probable second nomination on the way for North Country, nobody can possibly doubt that Charlize Theron can act. In Aeon Flux, however, we see less of Theron's stellar abilities than we do her incredible good looks. In fact, Theron appears in one skin tight costume after the next (and wait until you see what she sleeps in, boys!) which are so overtly intended to be sexy that they actually begin to take away from what Aeon really is and what Theron is otherwise capable of doing. Sophie Okonedo's Sithandra actually fares a bit better here as she's allowed to be exactly what she and Aeon are supposed to be, that being highly trained agents of revolution.\n\nMartin Czokas comes off well, appearing earnest and natural before the cameras. Jonny Lee Miller, though, smirks his way through the film with a \"look at me, I'm in the movies!\" attitude, while the brilliant Frances McDormond (who gave a terrific performance opposite Theron in North Country) is woefully miscast.\n\nThe storyline is relatively thin, though I'm not sure we should have expected more than from a film based on some MTV animated characters. The inexperienced director (Karyn Kasuma, who has only one small film under her belt) was in over her head as evidenced by two-dimensional performances from even the best actors as well as choppy edits.\n\nThe film's writers may have aimed for \"surreal,\" but would have been better served had they set their sights more toward just plain \"real\" since much of the dialogue tried much too hard to seem like the people talking might be living in the distant future. Overt inconsistencies also mar the screenplay. Meanwhile, the film's costumers fell into an identical trap, making collars stick up and cutting fabric asymmetrically with a \"look, we're in the future!\" wink as they did so.\n\nThe cinematography, though, was quite good; so was the set design. The stunt work was impressive to say the least (Theron performed most of her own stunts, and looked just fine doing so). And, not surprisingly, special effects are everywhere. Fortunately, they're very, very well done.\n\nAs a whole, Aeon Flux is all right if you're feeling \"science fictiony.\" As eye candy alone, it's frankly worth the price of admission. But missed opportunities to be so much deeper and, as a result, better, make Aeon Flux as a whole a disappointment at best.\n\nPOLITICAL NOTES: At one point, Aeon Flux notes that the residents of Bregna \"gave up freedom for life in a gilded cage.\" While Bregna is lovely and no one is homeless or hungry, it's just as true that everybody is watched on a constant basis, and that armed patrols on the streets make it clear that the beauty is only skin deep. That's a valid point, and one I appreciate the movie having made. Far worse for our own present day reality, however, was the reaction of one amateur reviewer who took issue with anybody railing against a government that took such good care of its citizens. It's that attitude that will make the gilded cage scenario all the more likely in our own future, and we can bet that it won't be nearly so pretty as the on screen Bregna when it happens.\n\nFAMILY SUITABILITY: Aeon Flux is rated PG-13 for \"sequences of violence and sexual content.\" That rating seems about right to me. Small children will be scared by some of the action sequences; they also won't understand even the most basic portions of the plot (such as it is). Teen (and even older) boys will love the film based solely on Theron's costumes, and I can see their point; science fiction fans will also have a little something to whet their appetites until the next big (and hopefully better) Hollywood offering comes along. In the main, however, if you've got Christmas shopping to do, you might want to skip the movies this weekend and hold out for the upcoming Chronicles of Narnia instead."

This movie is not nearly as bad as one might guess, considering the facts that (1)it was produced by Hollywood hack's hack Gale Anne Hurd; (2)it is an adaptation of a cartoon, which studios notoriously ruin in film versions; (3) it was not screened for critics, which almost always means a movie sucks, but definitely means that a studio has almost no faith in it. For further evidence, consider when it was released, prime movie season, and what it was going up against, a year's worth of fantasy franchise entries (including Harry Potter and the Narnia movie) and the usual late-year Oscar contenders. The movie has its points. The acting is good enough. The set designs are phenomenal, worth the price of admission alone for architecture aficionados. The story was not quite as bad as what I am accustomed to, considering it deals with human clones (which must be in the played-out sci-fi hack's field guide). The character of Aeon is not as strange as in the cartoon, and the movie suffers for it. It is simply not very interesting without the Aeon Flux we all know and love, by which I mean the character, not the identically-named character played by Theron. Why didn't they make this into a cartoon movie? Also, a lot of morons are probably comparing this to The Matrix, which is unwarranted. This movie most recalls Logan's Run and Barbarella in terms of story and set design and Aeon's character, respectively. In fact, I'd list Barbarella as an inspiration for the cartoon character. Also, The Matrix is obviously the superior movie, albeit no less derivative. I thought this movie was also a little boring. The original was great (by which I mean fun to watch) because it didn't need coherent story or consistent characterization to be entertaining and engaging. This movie missed that critical point."

It's all good.\n\nYou've got to understand, I have never been a fan of the visuals-driven movie. Occasionally a film is so revolutionary (Blade Runner, Edward Scissorhands, The Matrix) that you simply have to applaud, but most of those movies have other things going for them. Far, FAR too much crapola gets filmed these days and passed off as 'art' when all it really is is 'flashy.' The worst offenders have always been genre flicks (fantasy, horror, sci-fi), and the worst of *those* have been supposedly \"futuristic\" science fiction films which take their 'vision o' the future' oh-so-seriously, yet fail to understand that the future's changes will be more than simply grim recreations of 1930's Germany (Equilibrium) or a rather glitzy version of an L.A. mall scene (Ultraviolet).\n\nFinally, with Aeon Flux, there seems to have been some real care taken. The clothing, the architecture, even the foodstuffs have a slightly-slimy, neoprene 'wetness' to them which goes right along with the core themes of bio-engineering, yet manages to avoid ripping off either H.R. Giger or the Watchowski Brothers. Kudos to them for producing what is, yes, an effects-driven film, but one in which those effects serve the mood and purpose of the narrative.\n\nOh, the plot and characters and whatnot?

One thing that was good about it was when she was walking down that hall way when she first got in the building she was dropping those things from her ring and than when she started whistling they came up and became balls and blew her out of the cell. another thing that i liked was that her friend had hands for feet that was sweet and when she almost fell on the spikey grass, and her friend saved her."

According to the notes, Charlize did most of the fighting and stunts, which may have hamstrung the amount of action, but the lack of CGI actually made you concentrate of the story, heaven forbid in this type of movie.\n\nI liked that they chose real locations in Germany. It was part of that make it seem real, which probably turned off a lot of people.\n\nThe movie was a good over all concerted effort, but did not play to the audience, which would be drawn to a Comic book/animated movie cross over."

Fits the mold of the 2000's terribly over produced film perfectly. Watched it to get it off my watchlist and have no intention to revisit it."

From what I understand, it's better and/or much more complicated than the movie. Throughout watching, I didn't really dislike this, not as such... it certainly has its moments, and tends to entertain. The plot isn't horrible, and has an idea or two of interest... it does come off a bit like an agenda-driven piece, at times(to say what exactly I'm referring to would be revealing spoilers), and whether or not you agree with the message(if it is well-delivered, on the whole), well, there are other forums for expressing such, and it wasn't really evident that it was going to be such... and if you spend about an hour and a half watching something, you ought to take more away from it than something that could be summed up in the words \"*insert word* is bad\"(but I would say that I did). The writing is hit-and-miss. Dialog does have some lines that are reasonable, but the poor ones are, at times, awful. The story does perhaps feature an instance or two of the scene that they *really* wanted in there being put in even though it contradicts something else in the film. \u00c6on is almost/maybe *too* strong and skilled, and is too seldom in true danger... a flaw that this shares with Ultraviolet, but that picture has the advantage of some utterly unique, stylized imagery(and some *unbelievable* action), and where this does have, well, somewhat stylish visuals, there could still have been more tension in the action scenes(on the other hand, much of it is pretty cool... though there are occasions where the camera doesn't realize where it should point until it's too late). The editing and cinematography are fairly standard, which isn't necessarily a bad thing... except for when there are such odd angles and cuts that it takes you out of the experience, which is. The technical aspects seem rather marred by there being cut too many corners(why all the reused footage?), to the point where it more or less gets difficult to ignore or overlook. The special effects vary, but some are good. The look is nicely done, costumes, props, all the way(possibly more the design than the actual execution). Pacing is decent, I was never really bored. All in all, it is definitely watchable. Worth watching? Well, if you know what to expect, and the film is what you want... I enjoyed it, not everyone will. Don't go in thinking you'll be treated to mind-blowing sci-fi, action of Matrix proportions or execution, or something that will make you re-think your life... instead, just know that the action is awesome more often than it isn't, and that not-rid-of-clich\u00e9s plot is not as stupid as that of an awful lot of sci-fi action fare. I recommend this to those interested in what I describe immediately preceding this sentence. Fans of the show may find themselves disappointed. 6/10"

This movie focused too much of its time on \"cool\" sci-fi effects like those ridiculous steel balls and that woman with the hand-feet.

        "review_detailed_main": "The cartoon was awesome because it left so much to the imagination of the viewers and in place of unanswered questions, it had humor and graphic violence. Although, I do believe that the film answered these questions well and in the manner that the original author (Peter Chung) intended, it lacked somehow. First off the beginning dragged, and the rest of the film seemed to be more of a showcase for gadgets and Aeon's acrobatics (which were at best convoluted), than a solid believable sci-fi flick with true morality at its core. In addition to that there was practically no humor, and the performances were borderline. Not that I expected all that much though, since it was such a big production. I guess my main complaint is that it didn't stay all that true to the original cartoon. In the cartoon Monicans were supposedly a whole other civilization that existed on the border of Bregna, for crying out loud. However, being a huge fan of science fiction I practically required to like this movie. All in all it was not that bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "But its for people who like science fiction, but never got too attached to the anime.\n\nAeon Flux zealots will most likely dislike the movie. Lord knows, I was ready to pass on it, based on the rumors (many true). I believe the reason for this is the themes are different between the anime and the movie. The movie actually has a plot, has a human element, (more) dialogue, and its easier to follow. While the original anime had a strong kinky sexual vibe, lots of social commentary undertones, and lots of gratuitous violence. Think of it as a (semi) original sci-fi movie with Aeon Flux grafted to the title.\n\nYeah, Theron isn't in the scantily clad combat outfit, but if you can forget about slavish adherence to detail, she still looks damn good in Lycra. She does look too chubby to be Aeon (a long faced, sinewy anorexic), but has the vocal tone and facial expressions. Marlon does not vaguely resemble Goodchild, but the story is different, so his acting matches the movie rendition.\n\nBut part of the problem (besides Theron being too pushy for her own good), is that you get the sense that Kusama either had no clue about the aesthetic of the anime, or was set on abandoning it to pursue her vision of AF. So while I can give it kudos for the re-visioning, it just does not capture the feel of the anime. The action sequences are not that good, and the tone is BLAND. It needed more frenetic activity, like The Matrix. There is no sense of cinematography adding atmosphere to the movie. (A Kubrick or Verhoeven would have addressed that better.) It feels like a chick director wanting to make an inherently male oriented cartoon more palatable to chicks as a chick flick. Robert Rodriguez (Sin City) would have been more faithful to the anime, and probably would have done a better job.\n\nI find it incredible irony that a movie production decides to inject \"plot\" into a cartoon, improves it from a content point of view, and yet fails horribly at the box office. But its not a HORRIBLE movie. I'd kinda put it in The Island or Sky Captain level sci-fi movie."

The story was swinging all over the place. Believe it or not I fell asleep in the theatre! for 5 minutes until the pointless bass and sfx woke me up again. I wanted to run away from the theatre in the middle of the movie but did not for some strange reason.\n\nLong story short.

        "review_detailed_main": "When Charlize Theron starred as sympathetic serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster, I decided to myself that this actor can do ANYTHING! When she got cast as Aeon Flux in the live action adaptation of the MTV animated series of the same name, I was more than ecstatic. I had no doubt that this actor could do this character justice and play her believably and realistically.\n\nUpon viewing the film, I was right. Theron's Aeon sounds and acts just like the animated version; the movie looks and feels just like the animated series, right down to the weird camera angles and all; and the storyline is multi layered and up for personal interpretation as well. Just like the animated series.\n\nAll involved obviously had a huge love for the series, but also made sure the movie stood on it's own. The movie could easily be seen as an episode of the series, as well as a stand alone feature.\n\nAs usual, Aeon is trying to kill Trevor and as usual, she can't because she loves him. The movie includes one other character from the series - Sithandra, who has two hands where her two feet should be - and introduces Aeon's sister - Una Flux - who becomes a central plot point in the movie.\n\nWhat sets the movie apart from other action movies is that the action is secondary. The plot is central and really does drive the actions of the characters. While there is plenty of action scenes, they are usually set against really beautiful backdrops: a cherry tree garden, a secret minimalist room, the city of Bregna itself.\n\nCreator Peter Chung was a little more displeased with this product, but that's expected, especially considering he had little to no involvement with this piece. Director Karyn Kusama, who also directed Girlfight, really strives for the look and feel of Peter Chung's creation. While there is talk of extra scenes that were exercised out of the film, the finished product feels like a classic all on it's own. A real treat for fans of the series, fans of action films and those looking to watch a movie that makes them think.\n\nBut a note to creater Peter Chung. How about making your own Aeon Flux film? Animated and all? http://neonboy619.blogspot.com"
