        "review_title": "An effective remake showing how horror should be done",
        "review_detailed_main": "Good, contemporary horror films are scarce. Only a handful of exceptions avoid the bin containing wasted efforts; those horrors that are too often comprised of tired clich\u00e9s and cheap, ineffective scare tactics, denying them any chance of lingering in the memory and opening the doorway for a slew of pointless sequels of varying crassness. It's easier to search for old classics from the 70s/80s for worthy genre entries. Ones that come to mind are The Thing, The Omen, The Wicker Man, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, plus others, for their ability to be equally shocking, subversive and entertaining. Perhaps a less viewed horror - yet with a well-known title - is 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' (1978 remake), a profoundly disturbing tale of alien possession that knows how to scare its audience without trying too hard.\n\nThe plot: spores from outer space begin duplicating the human race one by one, perfectly copying every detail except for being entirely devoid of emotion. It's a straightforward story that commences immediately with the main threat beginning its quiet invasion. It's up to a few survivors - led by Donald Sutherland's health inspector and his female colleague - to evade a chilling fate, while trying to figure out a way to stop something seemingly unconquerable. Who will survive? Will anyone survive? How can the remaining humans win? Questions like these haunt the runtime, and 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is so effective because it feels strangely plausible. The narrative funnels you down an increasingly claustrophobic path with no outlet, no room to breathe, then snares you into an ending you won't soon forget. It's an inevitable conclusion, but it's a no less intimidating final image just because it had to happen; a chilling kicker that touches primal fears of isolation and the unknown. Co-starring Jeff Goldblum, Brooke Adams and Leonard Nimoy, everyone does a commendable job of conveying panic, distrust and anxiety.\n\nDirector Phillip Kaufman employs gritty camerawork that further manipulates viewers emotions: low angle shots, tremulous zooms, lingering wide shots... these techniques all contribute to the unfolding chaos - the unbeatable alien menace - and ramping up the dread that becomes overwhelming halfway through when survival is paramount but improbable. It's not your typical alien invasion, but the stealthy attack is all the creepier for it, as these plant lifeforms take over family and friends with reckless biological instinct. Seeing people as emotionless automatons is a flesh-crawling prospect, and the screams they illicit when discovering and chasing a survivor owes a lot to the eerie sound design which consistently complements each chilling image.\n\nOverall, 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' succeeds on very simple ingredients. It digs under the skin, coils tighter and tighter as proceedings play out, and relies on paranoia to generate its terror without needing violence and gore. Combined with strong direction, impressive practical effects (for the time) and a nerve-wracking sound design, this is true horror in its simplest form; a terrific blend of sci-fi and horror planting its roots deep for an unsettling experience modern genre efforts should try emulating.\n\nScore - 8.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Invasion of the Body Snatcher (1978)\n\nThe original 1950s version of this movie is such a favorite of mine, I hesitated to watch this one. But fear not. This is great, too. It's got the same theme, but very richly and creatively rendered, some superb photography, great night stuff, and most importantly, great acting by the key 3 or 4 people.\n\nDirector Philip Kaufman works sporadically as director and writer (he hit it big with \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\") and he clearly has a unique and somewhat fearless vision that remains rooted in Hollywood sensibilities. That is, this is no independent film, yet it's creative.\n\nAnd it's scary. Between the development of fear over the actual biological invasion, and the old fashioned chase and hide sequences, this is a tense movie. But yet it's convincing, given the realistic, nuanced acting by the main couple, Donald Sutherland (as a Health Department official) and Brooke Adams (as a lab analyst in the same department). Of course, what happens isn't believable at all, somehow, but it's so close to feasible, and in fact so close to what we live with already (some people without feelings, out for themselves, part of a conspiracy, etc.), it isn't hard to pull it off.\n\nCinematographer Michael Chapman is about as good as it gets in the Hollywood vein, polished and with amazing, varied lighting (he also did \"Raging Bull,\" \"The Fugitive,\" and \"Taxi Driver,\" for starters). So this movie works on every level. The one thing it isn't, of course, is original, but as a remake, we have to take it for how it handles it, 1970s style. Impressive."

        "review_detailed_main": "Invasion of the Body Snatchers is the remake of 1956 movie by the same title and considered to be, by many fans, to be the definitive and the best version of the story.\n\nThe movie begins with images of plasmas from an alien world floating out into space towards planet earth. Then the rain comes and we see an odd organism growing on plants' leafs. Before too long, people start to act strange, they group and exchange plants, they act indifferent to their surroundings, they are emotionless, almost robotic. A group of characters who are not affected soon find themselves a minority in a world that is changing rapidly.\n\nOne of the greatest appeals of this movie is its socio-political resonance. It can be interpreted as a state of minority versus majority, us versus them and individualism versus social conformity. It shows how we try to turn the others into a version of ourselves because we can't tolerate the otherness. And maybe this is a universal common trait of all beings whether alien or human. Even though the commentary is about humans, it is actually alien organism that takes over human bodies (snatches human bodies - hence body snatchers).\n\nThe movie also questions how much we should sacrifice to achieve harmony in society. Should we preserve our individuality at risk of conflicting with other members of the society, or should we just join the majority, think like others, walk like others and talk like others do? Like all great science fiction movies, the story is social commentary on the state of the world. This is probably the reason why there are so many versions of this movie. And most recently in 2007, another version was made called \"The Invasion\" starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig."

        "review_title": "Surely the superlative 'Body snatchers' film",
        "review_detailed_main": "The 1956 film is an enduring classic; Abel Ferrara's 1993 picture is extra jarring as it emphasizes the horror element. Even as the concept has been explored time and again to various ends throughout different media (the two episodes of sci-fi comedy show 'Eureka' preceding the series finale is a favorite example of mine), somehow I've missed out all these years on this 1978 rendition. Now that I've finally caught up I can't believe it's taken so long: this is utterly phenomenal.\n\nFrom one variation to the next each adaptation of 'The body snatchers' takes a slightly different approach. The 1978 movie is noticeably longer in its runtime, and more drawn out in its pacing - with the payoff of being distinctly haunting, and arguably more deeply frightening, as the course of events develops. This remains true even as the narrative is slightly more scattered, bouncing around a bit for a time between different scenes and characters, and that's at least in part thanks to the sensibilities of cinematic storytelling that changed in the intervening 22 years: this 'Invasion of the body snatchers' progressively shows us much more as the narrative advances, and whether it's just more creepy and unnatural behavior, or the specific effects and fabrications realizing genre elements, the cumulative effect is intensely unnerving.\n\nThat is to say that 'Invasion' successfully builds incredible, pervasive atmosphere that never once yields; I'm rather reminded of the films of John Carpenter, a master of horror whose bread and butter throughout his career has been that same dread air. In some such features it might be one aspect or another, or some combination, that helps to achieve that aura; here, it rather seems that every single facet is discretely bent toward it. Relatively few are those pictures in which sound effects so emphatically contribute to the viewing experience, yet in this instance they are crucial and arresting. From subtle makeup to more advanced prosthetics and special effects, the visuals are all but excruciating (again recalling Carpenter, I say as a major fangirl), bolstered by very careful cinematography, lighting and shadow, and precise orchestration of every shot and scene. At all times Denny Zeitlin's score strikes exactly the right chords - discordant or sweeping, light and sparing or heavy and foreboding - to give further shape to the proceedings. The acting from this terrific cast is perfect and focused across the board; among others, Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum, and Veronica Cartwright impress with what I'm inclined to think are surely among the best performances they've ever given.\n\nOutstanding production design and art direction adjoin superb filming locations to foster a horrific sense of how solidly rooted and wide-ranging the conspiracy is. Where some scenes pointedly echo the 1956 classic, the rendition here is unquestionably more visceral, more explosive, more fiercely engaging and invigorating. Conversely, Ferrara's treatment is more closely centered on a particular setting, and makes the most of 90s notions of horror within that space - but for as vivid as it may be, to my astonishment the 1978 film still comes out on top in terms of the feelings it imparts, the reactions it elicits. Characters feel more complete and sympathetic, dialogue is more vitally charged and relatable, and at every turn the scene writing and narrative resonate more powerfully. As much as I love Don Siegel's picture, and Ferrara's, from top to bottom this is a more absorbing, spellbinding, menacing, disquieting, fulfilling viewing experience - and outright superior.\n\nEvery now and again one watches a movie that so wholly entrances us that it's difficult to find the words to elucidate the joy of watching. We talk in circles, we trip over ourselves, in our exuberance we lose track of some of what we might want to see. 1978's 'Invasion of the body snatchers' is one of those movies. I had high expectations when I sat to watch, for all the reasons, and still they were handily exceeded. What more is there to say? This is a must-see, and that's all there is to it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a solid horror/sci-fi story with good production values. Those values include outstanding direction by Philip Kaufman, camera-work by Michael Chapman and acting. The cast of main characters was comprised of Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright. Of the group, Sutherland had the most lines and was the most impressive. All of it added up to a pretty classy film, a lot more than you'd except reading the movie title.\n\nThere was some profanity and nudity so maybe it wasn't totally classy, but the profanity was light and the nudity was a few shots of Adams' breasts.\n\nThe movie clicked because it built up the suspense beautifully, and proved you don't need a lot of violence and gore to scare the viewer. Too bad modern filmmakers of horror films can't seem to understand that. In fact the scariest thing of the movie - and it WAS scary - might have been the eerie noises emanating from the \"re-born\" humans.\n\nThe photography is good and I loved the facial closeups and interesting camera angles. The film is a visual treat. The original film in 1956 is a good one but it's generally conceded this re-make is superior. The star of that first film, by the way - Kevin McCarthy, makes a cameo appearance in here. That was a nice touch."

Also, the fact that it is a little more drawn out and conceptualized, it makes for a better night of movie making than the original."

It would have been interesting to watch a version in the sixties, ten years after the Don Siegel's film, made in the fifties. Maybe it would have been also different.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have never been a fan of horror movies or remakes because they are usually not good. But when done right, they can be special movies. Invasion of the Body Snatchers happens to be both a remake and a horror movie, so I had my doubts. Luckily, this is a really good movie. This film is based off the 1956 film of the same name, and I hear it is a good movie. So when a remake at least equals the quality of the original, then that means you did something right. Most people seem to agree that this movie equals the same horror tone as the original, but it passes it in terms of conception. There are many themes this movie expanded on. Such themes include paranoia, the idea of dehumanization whether it's mentally or quite literally in the case of this movie. You could also talk about the idea of the lack of trust of people in an increasing complicated world. The original had roots in communism as the 1950's were known for paranoia as the Cold War escalated. You could easily see the transfer of those ideas in this film. Paranoia is rampant as these invisible alien creatures take over human bodies and minds. These ideas really created the tension and horror that the movie needed.\n\nThis science-fiction remake is sent in the city of San Francisco, California. One day, Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) complains to her good friend Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) that her husband has been acting very strange. Bennell originally dismisses the thought as marital problems. But when more people start complaining, he becomes increasingly concerned. When writer Jack Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum) and his wife Nancy (Veronica Cartwright) uncover a mutated corpse, Bennell realizes that the world has been taken over by an unseen force. Now it's up to him to beat the clock before the whole city turns into mutants.\n\nThe film does have a good cast, and they all turned in solid performances. Donald Sutherland is a great actor, and he showed himself some range here. Brooke Adams made a name for herself earlier in 1978 with Days of Heaven, and she turns in another good performance. Jeff Goldblum is an amazing actor as you will see in future movies, but he is really good in one of his earlier roles in this film. One of the best performances in the film comes from the amazing Leonard Nimoy. You might know him from his iconic role as Spock in the original Star Trek television series. He is usually typecast as similar characters in his movies, but this role as Dr. David Kibner gives him something fresh, something different. He plays more of a villainous character, and it's a welcome sight.\n\nThe production design adds to the horror elements. The look of the movie is creepy and sometimes downright scary. The pods where humans are transformed are wonderfully scary. When the movie shows how these humans are transformed is the ultimate prize when it comes to being scared. Any fan of horror would appreciate this.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers much to my surprise and delight. It succeeds in giving me the creeps, but in such intelligent ways. It's a thematic film touching on concepts of paranoia-which was a very popular concept considering what was going on in the world at the time. So remember if you see any pods nearby, well lets hope it is not an invisible alien making you its next prey. After all, I became a little paranoid for a few days after I saw the movie.\n\nMy Grade: B+"

If there's one thing this hopeless remake/ re-adaptation has, it's one heck of an ominous atmosphere. From the moment the movie begins, there's just something off about it. There's already a fifty-fifty chance that the people on screen are at the very least incredibly creepy, if not entirely otherworldly (an early cameo from Robert Duvall as a child-watching priest stands out amidst a sea of cold stares and random running and blink-and-you'll-miss-them bystanders who are just a bit too interested in our protagonists), and that chance only increases as the picture edges closer and closer to its seemingly inevitable final movement. Although it is rather slow, especially during its transitional mid-section, it's ultimately a rather scary affair that may not always be conventionally enjoyable but is arguably better for it. It's the kind of film that unapologetically moves at its own pace, and I can't bring myself to criticise it too harshly for that even though I also can't deny there are areas in which it could have been tightened up slightly. The success of its overall effect outweighs its occasional in-the-moment sluggishness, and makes for a distinct experience that never threatens to dilute its striking central premise with notions of overly Hollywood-style storytelling. It's a really strong update to the 1956 original."

Before long, more and more people are claiming the same thing about their friends and relatives. Just what is going on? Although not quite as good as the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), this remake is very interesting and well worth a watch. Some things it does better than the original, although slightly more is not done as well. But it is full or intriguing ideas, some beautiful cinematography, and quite a few quirky charms.\n\nOne oddity about this film is that it seems to assume that very few people will watch who aren't already familiar with the original. Scripter W.D. Richter and director Philip Kaufman give away the \"twist\" immediately, and there are a number of statements from characters in this film (such as the first time we hear the advice to not fall asleep) that only make sense if one already knows from Don Siegel's original just why they shouldn't fall asleep. For this reason, I strongly recommend that anyone interested in this film who hasn't seen it yet should make sure they watch the original first.\n\nThe opening shots, which firmly set this remake into sci-fi territory, are a great idea, even if the execution is somewhat questionable. I'm not sure that Kaufman's \"art gel\" works, and the way it moves through space, as if blown by trade winds, is slightly hokey. But I'm willing to forgive a misstep if it's in service of a great idea, and especially if the misstep is the result of budgetary limitations.\n\nEarly in the film, the major asset is the cinematography. There is an excellent, slow tracking shot down a hallway, where we only see our main character by way of her feet and a slight reflection in a window. There are a lot of great \"tilted\" shots. There are a lot of subtle lighting effects to set mood, and a just as many subtle instances of symbolism for the horrors to come.\n\nThe cast, featuring Adams, Donald Sutherland, Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy and Veronica Cartwright, is an interesting combination of stars who tend to give idiosyncratic performances. Kaufman exploits the collection of personalities well, although occasionally gives us odd \"everyone talk at once\" scenes which can verge on the brink of annoying. Although I'm not usually the biggest fan of Goldblum (in some roles, such as The Fly, I like him, in some roles he tends to irritate me), I noted an odd similarity between him in this film and an actor and performance I'm much more fond of--David Duchovny and his X-Files character Fox Mulder.\n\nSpeaking of that, there is a strong X-Files vibe to this film overall. Whereas the original Invasion had thinly veiled subtexts of fear and doubts of \"The Other\"--whether politically-rooted (the common analysis is that the original Invasion was a subtext for U.S. fears of communism), religiously-rooted (some see it as a parable about cults, or religions in general) or simply about personal identity (in a philosophical sense of \"Who am I/are you?\" \"What makes one oneself?\"), Kaufman's take has stronger subtexts of encroaching mental illness--fear of losing one's mind and a generalized, \"clinical\" paranoia.\n\nGiven that difference, it's perhaps odd that there are so many similarities between the two films. The character structure and relationships are largely the same, with some mostly insignificant differences, including slightly different occupations. There are many scenes taken almost verbatim from the original film, often only with differences of setting, but staged the same, with similar scenarios and occasionally identical dialogue. There is even a wonderful moment where Kevin McCarthy, star of the original film, comes running down the street, screaming that we're all doomed.\n\nA number of quirky moments push the value of Kaufman's film up a notch. These are sprinkled throughout the film, but some highlights are a Robert Duvall cameo as a priest inexplicably on a swingset next to toddlers, the \"mud bath\" parlor, a brief spurt of marvelous, Zappa-sounding avant-garde classical as we witness a chase down a staircase, and a greenhouse in a shipping yard, through which Elizabeth eventually strolls naked, casually walking by employees. The \"creature\" effects may be better here than in the original, but they are not more effective for that.\n\nBut overall, this is a great film. Just make sure you don't miss the superior original."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is not a remake, but rather a reboot because, although the premise is identical and the films share some common moments, the story is elaborated quite differently. These are completely different characters, with different occupations and mutual relations, a different environment, and the development of events. Although the 1978 film has an impressive cast and better performances, a more complex script and better technical aspects, the original has a better atmosphere and it left a stronger impression on me. Maybe it's partly because I saw the original first, but I don't think it's just that. This story works well as a psychological drama and mystery thriller, but not as an explicit horror. This film made mistakes that its predecessor skillfully avoided, and with too much action, violence, and explicit effects, it spoiled the atmosphere, broke the tension, and made the story unconvincing and ineffective. What could have been a powerful psychological drama was almost turned into a corny B horror in the manner of the eighties. I also resent it for the completely unneeded introductory scene, which at the very beginning dispels the mystery and the potentially strong surprise effect. It is the fact that, since this is a remake, this movie is spoiled by the first one, but why ruin the surprise and mystery to those who did not watch the original ... The only thing I really liked about this film was the \"cameo\" appearance of Kevin McCarthy, in which he \"replays\" the final scene of the original.\n\n6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is a well-crafted sci-fi horror masterpiece drenched in paranoia and intense sequences and bathed into a conspiracy driven atmosphere. Thanks to its frightening premise, this is one outstandingly unsettling production that creates an exquisite experience of terror and paranoia that will honestly make your skin crawl. This wonderful remake is well and truly a must see of 70's horror cinema.\n\nThe Plot = Mysterious pods begins to grow and invade the city of San Franscisco. A health board field investigator named Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) receives multiple reports that people are acting strangely without any emotion and the more it happens, he and his small group of friends realize that they must escape the city before its too late.\n\nRemaking an already classic sci-fi horror flick can be a daunting task as it will be instantly and constantly compared to the original. However, this late 70's iteration is an unforgettable masterpiece that stands on its own and, in some ways, improves upon the original 1956 classic of the same name by relocating this remake into a contemporary American city instead of a small town, which adds an even more terrifying angle. Thanks to the flawless direction by Phillip Kauffman the movie carries a haunting foreboding tone throughout its runtime with no shortage of eerie and disturbing moments scattered in there for good measure. The special effects work here are also brilliant and adds another layer of greatness to this already iconic 70's horror flick.\n\nThe acting performances here are fantastic with Donlad Sutherland turning a great performance as the leading man, with such outstanding conviction he gives it his all gives in his all in the heroic role. Brooke Adams gives an excellent and genuine performance as the female lead. Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright each give strong performances in their respective roles. Leonard Nimoy also delivers a great performance in his interesting role and rounds out the enthralling cast nicely.\n\nOverall 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is one of the best remakes ever made, whether you think its better or worse than the 1956 original is up for debate, but you can't deny how impressive this masterpiece of 70's horror cinema really is."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is one of my favorites. There were so many films from the 1950s that involved an alien threat menacing small town Americana, but 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' was one of the few standouts because it took what it was doing seriously. Not another in a long series of man-in-a-rubber-suit movies, its tactics were more psychological. We, like Dr. Bennell, are uncertain what's going on or even if there actually *is* anything going on until its too late. Then the walls close in on the doctor and Becky, and nowhere is safe, there is nowhere to hide. Added to this is the film's ambiguous subtext, and you end up with a movie that really is much better than it should be.\n\nWhile I don't think the remake was bad necessarily, I don't think there's anything remarkable about it either. It was good for what it was, but it lacked any real suspense because it began by revealing the threat and then rushed to get that threat underway. Setting the film in a large city was a mistake. One of the strengths of the original was the confusion and horror the characters felt as they slowly watched the people around them, the people they had grown up with and known so well, become strangers. That element's lost when you set the movie in a place where nearly everyone is a stranger to begin with, where you wouldn't know if the person walking down the street is different today than they had been the day before. I also think the third act is overly long and drags out.\n\nKudos to the man-faced dog, though. That was great."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film begins with a short sequence that explains how a parasite from outer space gets on Earth, taking over humanity, with no chance to win over it. It duplicates and kills people while they are sleeping. For sure this is not your average alien invasion, and the events are narrated in such a realistic way, with no over the top, unjustified violence. There are so many original elements: the alien species takes the shape of a peculiar and apparently harmless flower. Humans start to collect them, attracted by their beauty, like a carnivorous plant that sets traps for mosquitoes. The movie makes you constantly doubt: is this invasion really happening, or is it a mind trick Elizabeth due to the stress? Who is still human and trustworthy? Who is already duplicated and trying to lure the protagonists? This constant tension kept me on the verge until the very end, as I wanted to know how humanity would handle this threat. The cast is formed of many great names such as Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy famous for portraying Spock in the acclaimed sci-fi franchise of 'Star Trek'. Because of his physical presence this guy was always suited for science fiction roles. Despite his limited screen-time, he covered an essential role that give the plot an interesting twist.\n\nThe special effects are simple and well made. The production used a lot of practical effects that look great and integrate seamlessly in the various environments. The few CGI shots are incredibly more advanced than a lot of modern productions that have more tools at their disposal and for sure also bigger budgets than \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\". It is truly a movie made with passion and it shows. For Cosmic Horror lovers, this is a must watch and it gets a solid 7.5 rate."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start out by saying that I am very fond of the original movie of 1956. But the biggest difference between the two films is the handling of the characters and the use of camera angles that ring of film noir. The characters of the 1956 offering are just a little bit generic. Dr Miles Bennell is an \"ordinary\" doctor in an ordinary town. Handsome and amiable, he does seem a bit \"typical\". The two couples that become the main focus are a little bit less defined, which was true of B-movie horror/SF flicks of the 1940's and 1950's in which the horror of the plot trumped character development. By the 1970's, horror had to some degree become more mainstream, and character development became nearly as important as the shock value in some of the higher-budgeted offerings. \"Rosemary's Baby\" and \"The Exorcist\" come to mind.\n\nThe four characters of the 1978 film are quite distinctive individuals. Matthew Bennell (played by Donald Sutherland and essentially the equivalent character to Miles Bennell) is a bureaucratic FDA inspector who gets his car windshield smashed when he tags a restaurant for sub-standard quality. His best friend is Elizabeth Driscoll (Brook Adams) who is a fun-loving woman with a rye sense of humor and married to a sports fanatic.\n\nBoth of the Jack Bellicec characters are writers, although in the 1978 offering, Jeff Goldblum's take on the role is as a very frustrated writer/poet who is jealous of the likes of Dr. David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy), pop-psychologist, writer and lecturer. Jack attends one of Kibner's lectures and book-signings. Nimoy plays his character to the hilt, acting like he has the answer to all people's problems. Goldblum at one point says \"His ideas are garbage. Pure garbage.\" response: \"How can you say that about a man like Kibner?\" Goldblum: \"Not a man like Kibner. I'm saying it about Kibner.\" We never find out what the character wrote about in the 1956 offering. Nancy Bellicec played by the incomparable Veronica Cartwright in the newer offering becomes a much more important character than in the 1956 film. She's the one, not Bennell, who realizes how to fool the \"snatched\" people by exhibiting no emotions. She has one of the best lines when she says \"Well why not a space flower? Why do we always expect metal ships?\n\nTheir lives start to fall apart when Elizabeth Driscoll claims her husband Geoffrey is not her husband. Before he is snatched, he is an amiable guy who enjoys watching sports events with headphones to hear the announcers. After he's snatched, all he watches on the television is a video of a stop-watch, as if for him life has stopped, and he's just marking time. She recounts to Sutherland how she followed him and that he was meeting all these strange people. Sutherland encounters others with similar dilemmas, particularly an older Asian couple who own a Laundromat. The older man claims \"she not my wife.\" The build-up in the 1978 offering is a little slower and more deliberate.\n\nJack's wife, Nancy Bellicec (Cartwright), discovers a duplicate body of Jack in a back room of their mud bath. At first the body seems to have almost no detail. But gradually it begins to look like Goldblum. Is there any connection with this body and this epidemic of people claiming that their loved ones are not their loved ones? In a particularly brilliant if not disturbing sequence, Bennell tries to call some of his contacts in the US government. The camera angles work well to literally dizzying affect as Bennell begins to realize the snatchers have infiltrated the government.\n\nAn incredible take on Jack Finney's original novel about the horror of losing one's identity to an emotionless collective, sort of akin to what it would be like to have to spend eternity with either Jehovah Witnesses or Beaurocrats! You are no longer you but simply a clone among the collective, a terrifying thought."

        "review_detailed_main": "Phillip Kaufman's adaptation of Jack Finney's classic novel had a lot to live up to after the classic 1956 take on it - and I think it lived up to expectations. Though not as great as the more politically orientated original, Kaufman's film is still a lesson in suspense and the central story has lost none of the intrigue that it captured in the original. The story follows an alien life form that has come from outer space and taken residence here on earth. Not content with living in sibilance with humans, the aliens become 'body snatchers' and make duplications of people while they're sleeping. These duplicates take the original host's place and are everything their originals were, only all forms of emotion vanish. Our story takes focus on Martin and Elizabeth, two workers at the US Health Department. After taking home a supposedly new type of flower, Elizabeth finds her boyfriend acting strangely and later discovers that she's not the only one with relatives who aren't quite themselves...\n\nThis film works because of a constant sense of paranoia. In the 1950's, this was tied in with the then 'reds under the beds' idea of communism spreading through capitalist America. This film seems to have dispensed with that idea, which gives way to more opportunity for sci-fi horror, which is more than welcome in my opinion. The special effects on display are bold and lavish, and therefore exciting to watch. They are a little hokey, but still not bad at all - the parts where you see the alien duplicate forming are fantastically gruesome, and also rather frightening. The whole idea of the film is frightening, even in spite of the fact that it ever happening is very unlikely. The idea that an alien race can take over almost an entire city in one night, and without anyone realising it, is not one that I'd like to have if I was a paranoid conspiracy theorist! Then there's the notion that they'll get you if you sleep as it's like one man in the film says...\"gotta sleep sometime\". Invasion of the Body Snatchers is also notable for featuring a great cast, which not only includes the excellent Donald Sutherland and the beautiful Brooke Adams, but also Jeff Goldblum (in his first of two successfully good remakes) and Leonard Nimoy, a.k.a. Captain Spock from Star Trek. Also watch out for cameos from original Invasion of the Body Snatchers director Don Siegel and said film's star."

It involves a health department and scientific research team investigating why people are becoming zombie-like shortly after going to sleep. I liked the beginning of the movie the best. The viewer is drawn into some clever outer-space camera shots. One feels that this is going to be good.\n\nBut than, it dies. The dialog is predictable and corny. Even the good actors can not make up for them being forced into B-grade Sci-Fi acting. Invasion of the Body Snatchers seems to drag on and on with very little to excite the viewer. In fact it was on one of my local stations last night and I kept falling asleep missing the last half hour of the movie! To achieve a great sci-fi effect that is everlasting to the viewer, there needs to be a suspense or build up that is maintained throughout the film. A few screams here and there over some strange corpses would be something that you would expect from a 50's horror film. This would be good for its time, but not enough for a 1978 film, which incidentally is a remake.\n\nWith this film coming out the year after Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the Star Wars phenomenon, one would expect better pacing in this film. IOTBS appears to have been put together with several characters that don't get into a weak plot, combined with a 50's type script. Good special effects can not save this weak movie.\n\nIt's too bad that the quality cast ensemble didn't have a stronger, faster-paced, script to showcase their acting abilities so that this film could have been better."

Donald Sutherland has never been better. Jeff Goldblum was allowed to be as unhinged as possible. Brooke Adams is absolutely lovely. Cute as a button, and those eyes! How she does that 'trick\" with rolling her eyes is a mystery to me. And Veronica Cartwright was as loony as she was in \"Alien.\" She's terrific. It's creepy, which is much more effective than \"scary.\" Yet when it wants to, it can scare the pants off you. (Think of the banjo player and his dog.) There's little things that require repeat viewings; such as all the garbage trucks, or people behind translucent glass doors simply watching as Sutherland and Adams talk in a hallway. The weird floor polisher, who just happens to be Michael Chapman, the film's cinematographer. Its cameos are so clever, they're brilliant. Kevin McCarthy screaming \"You're next!\" obviously recalls the later-added bumpers from the original. And Don Seigel even plays an odd cab driver! I love it. I like Philip Kaufman's other movies, but he never made another film as perfect as this. To paraphrase Ms. Kael, it's as close to perfect as a movie can get."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a lot of great sci-fi thrillers made in the 70s, but Invasion of the Bodysnatchers should feature highly on any list. That title alone is bloody brilliant, even if it's taken from the novel. The trick like with so many films like this, it's almost plausible. Granted we've got an invading alien species, but it's subtle, natural, organic. Quite literally. Spores rain down from outer space and begin to grow in San Fransisco. Initially no one knows where they're from, but it doesn't take long for concerns to be raised. Matthew (Donald Sutherland) is a health inspector. Making enemies with the local restaurants. He works with Elizabeth (Brooke Adams) who's recently been flower picking and brought something exotic home. The next day, her usually amorous boyfriend doesn't seem to be himself. She knows something's not right, following him around town she watches some odd behaviour and soon Matthew clocks that others are behaving weirdly too. It feels like a well paced slow burner, but it's not short on drama and it's not long before things begin to ramp up. Partly due to the menacing score and eerieness of an increasing cast of zombies slowly exchanging glances, but also Jeff Goldblum! He's Matthews friend Jack and with Goldlum's default manic delivery he's the perfect vessel to add fuel to the building conspiracy. His arch nemesis is fellow psychiatrist and writer Kibner (Leonard Nimoy), he thinks he's got the explanation for the rise of seemingly broken relationships... he's wrong. All this adds meat to the bones though and weight to the characters that would otherwise be wooden... like the bodysnatchers. We know what's happening, why it's happening (sort of), but not quite how and more importantly, how to stop it. As the snatching starts to affect the main players, things start to get freaky and we start to see the big difference between this remake and the earlier 1956 outing. It's much more visual with its make up and effects, including some body horror that would tick Croenbergs box. It's fantastical stuff. Kibner doesn't buy it. Elizabeth and the others see it though and even if Matthew thinks it crazy, he sees the danger. There are some illogical jumps, but with a story like this you've got to go with it. Don't overthink it, just enjoy the building paranoia, the gooey pods, the hopelessness and those terrifying gaping mouthed screams! Not many remakes are good, but this one is great."

Ostensibly the same as the human predecessor, these aliens display a withdrawn and distant emotion which is ultimately the key to detecting their false identity. In the chaos that ensues, Sutherland teams with Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright, while Leonard Nimoy makes his most significant acting contribution outside of \"Star Trek\" as the offbeat psychiatrist with all answers.\n\nSome memorable scenes and dialogue delivers suspenseful moments (the laundromat husband concerned about the changes in his wife's demeanour is pretty chilling) and overall it's a terrific sci-fi thriller. Probably a bit overlong, there' still enough suspense to entertain, and in the context of a remake (and in particular, one that remakes a classic sci-fi), director Kaufman has not disappointed."

This slow burn eventually switches gears into an anxious thriller with our protagonists caught up in a desperate chase. You think you know where this film is going, but you really don't. And I gotta tell ya, it is exciting.\n\nThis is a remake that forges its own path, stands on its own, and left me completely stunned as the silent end credits rolled. I don't wanna dwell on which is the better Body Snatchers (it's this one) but between the anxiety and the shock value, I enjoyed this film immensely.

Fortunately Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1978) is one of the truly great ones, one of those rarities that not just lives up to the original film but almost beats it.\n\nThe only reason why it doesn't quite is because the 1956 film does more with the change of the townsfolk. That said, it is a very well made film, with the special effects enhancing the mood rather than distracting from it and the scenery and cinematography striking. The make up is also outstanding.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers also has a strong score that just adds to the tension and suspense, a compelling story especially the ending, in fact for me I marginally preferred the ending here, the dialogue is intelligent and well-delivered and the direction is very fine.\n\nThere is some great acting too. Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams are strong leads, while Jeff Goldblum steals the scenes he appears in. Overall, a great film and worthy remake. Anybody who has not seen the Invasion with Craig and Kidman, it may be a good idea to keep it that way. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "An update of the classic from 1956.\n\nThe plot is basically the same with strange pods landing this time in San Francisco. Soon certain people are not quite who they were before lacking all emotional touch they used to have. A small group of people not yet taken by the pods, figure this out and try to do something, but the situation looks hopeless.\n\nAs with most remakes the film suffers on many levels. First and foremost anyone who has seen the first will not be in for much surprises since the plot and development is all very similar if not the same. The pods are even shown landing in the beginning of the film, which was a poor move since within the first 2 minutes people who HAVEN'T seen the original will know more than they should to totally enjoy the story. Much of the ambiguity is unnecessarily made clear in those moments and the original was ambiguous well into the film and you never knew more than the characters. Here that is not the case. Even as the pods begin to \"awaken\" (for lack of a better word) there is a pretty big focus on special effects with all sorts of tentacles going up peoples' noses and ears. I don't know about you, but if a slimy tentacle went up my nose, I think I'd stop breathing and sort of notice. The purely mental connection from the first one was more terrifying. As is small town setting where everyone knows everyone. The big city seems like a good place to place an update of the original, but the spread and suspicions as well as the fears of the protagonists aren't nearly as intense as they were in the first. Perhaps it is due to the general lack of suspense I felt since I have seen the original. First time viewers of the \"Body Sntachers\" films will undoubted have more to be tense about.\n\nHowever, this version does deserve credit for some innovation. The twist on the dog scene from the original is a REAL GOOD jolter. There is a fairly big consistency from the original that has been fixed in that we learn what happens to bodies after the pod clone is born. And the special effects aren't bad, quite gruesome actually, but they almost outrun themselves. --- 7/10\n\nRated PG, pretty generously, for violence and horror. Ages 13+."

        "review_title": "A Hip, Stylized, Reworking of a Timeless Classic",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is probably one of the most disturbing PG rated horror movies that I have ever seen, and one of the best remakes of an old classic. This movie is basically about the world being taken over by alien pods that replicate people, and then their clones become emotionless drones. A small group of survivors now must band together and stop them before they too become infected. There is one major factor that makes this movie so good and that's the way that it was written; in my opinion, remakes now a days don't have this kind of writing. This movie had a great cast of characters with excellent performances and a great theme that goes with the story. But, I cannot stress the fact that it is the best remake of its kind.\n\nThe acting in this movie was very well done and performed by top notch actors and actresses. This movie had two great performances by Brooke Adams, who plays Elizabeth, and Veronica Carthwright, who plays Nancy. They both did outstanding job acting extremely paranoid and overall scared, which I think heightens the emotional intensity of this film; something that the clones in the film obviously don't have. There are outstanding performances by Donald Sutherland, who plays Matthew, and Jeff Goldblum, who plays Jack, whose somber yet paranoid performances encourage the overall theme of the movie. There is a good supporting cast by Leonard Nimoy, who plays Dr. David Kibner, and Art Hindle, who plays Dr. Geoffrey. There performances give this movie that extra bone chilling kick that makes this film so good. It's just an overall great performance by all the actors and actresses.\n\nAs I said before, this movie is one of the best remakes ever, mainly because of the well-crafted writing and the plot structure that gives respects to the original movie. Because of the writing, there were a lot of disturbing undertones and scenes that the original movie could not accomplish, because of it's time, and those scenes are the \"larval\" stages of the clones, the slow build up of how the clones eventually take over everybody and just the way that the pods take over people. It's hard to explain, but the clones aren't just people running around taking over people, they are well organized, intelligent, systematic and horrifyingly emotionless. There screams haven't change that much, but in this reworking they are more of a horrible air raid siren. When you watch it, you'll notice that the clones and the progression of the alien take over is vastly different from the original and has a flavor to it that makes this movie raw, so to speak.\n\nLike the first movie, the central theme of this film is paranoia; however there is not allegory for real live events that would have caused this theme to work. However, what this movie does accomplish that the original one did not do is provide metaphors for what the world is experiencing. Case in point, there is a scene in which Sutherland is driving down a city block and we see a POV shot with a cracked window; this shows how the world we see is about to be shattered by the newly arrived guests. There are plenty of paranoia scenes, mostly dealing with Elizabeth and Mathew, but the one sequence that shows Mathew's paranoia is when he is calling all the emergency agencies and they all refuse him while he is vision is blurred with paranoia. There is plenty of third-characters that heighten this theme even more than the main characters and secondary characters. A good example is when an old man jumps on Sutherland's car and screams about how \"they\" are taking over the world. This old man is played by none other than Kevin McCarthy from the original movie.\n\nOverall, this movie is one of the best remakes ever; I really cannot stress that enough. This remake had things that remakes now a days don't have and that's a well crafted plot, great performances and a hard hitting central theme. This movie's plot structure pays tribute and respects to the original 50s classic. This is one of those few cases were the remakes is equal are better to its predecessor. I would strongly recommend this movie to any horror fan as well as any beginning horror fanatic. Those who are a fan of the original and cult classics would enjoy this too; ultimately I think any kind of horror fan should see this movie because it is very memorable. As for me, this is a movie that I can watch again and again because it's just very well made."

All the ideas were already in Siegel's version,which renders the new one predictable,really that crowns it for a movie which focuses on suspense.\n\nSPOILER * SPOILER* SPOILER IN THIS PART: A good trick is to be credited to the script writers.At the end of the movie,Sutherland becomes like \"them\".The director did not use the cinematographic codes:he did not show Sutherland's surrender,and as he leaves his office ,we think he's always \"normal\".That kind of ellipsis ,which will rarefy as the cinema makes its way across the eighties,shows that he assimilated at least one of the Master Alfred's lessons.END OF SPOILER.\n\nThere will be a third version(Body snatchers,Ferrara,1994).I agree with M.Maltin when he writes:\"Setting the story in a military base when everybody's is supposed to act alike...not a good idea \" Stick up with Don Siegel's version,without color,scope,stars,but with a genius going for it."

One day she announces that her husband is not the same person anymore after she brings in a strange flower she finds on the street. With a few more incidents on similar lines, Matthew takes it a bit more seriously and finds out the human beings are being replaced by Alien clones and the entire government and public services are already replaced. With him, Elizabeth, Jack (Jeff Goldblum) and his wife being considered fugitives, they become desperate to find a way out.\n\nOne of the poorly executed science fiction movies of the time. It neither worked as sci-fi drama nor a thriller with a good central idea but a very dumb way of implementing it. The unnecessary gimmicks in photography, very loud background score, an irritating nerd of a Jeff Goldblum, poor pacing - everything about it felt wrong. Brooke Adams is very inconsistent with masterful dialogue diction at times and unnecessary screaming and whining otherwise. Donald Sutherland just looked uninterested with the whole mess happening around him. Since the script was originally written in the 50s, I don't think this version didn't seem to upgraded itself (cannot confirm since I have not seen the original) as the technology looked outdated even for its time to be a science fiction.\n\nClumsy, outdated, overrated, slow and dumb."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently watched the original 1950's Don Siegel-directed movie on which this remake was based and firstly would like to say how cool it was that both Siegel and the star of his movie, Kevin McCarthy got their own noteworthy cameos here. Long-regarded as one of the superior remakes of an established classic, it successfully updates the action to contemporary San Francisco, ironically in a style similar to that employed by the latter-day Siegel in his gritty, realistic crime dramas of the late 60's and 70's.\n\nSure you have to swallow a huge credibility pill to engage with the narrative, but here the matter-of-fact direction by Philip Kaufman and unfussy acting by his leads, Donald Sutherland Brooke Adams and a young Jeff Goldblum keeps the film grounded even as the situation escalates out of control. I'd also venture to say that in the wake of the recent Covid pandemic, it now seems to have a topicality giving it extra resonance.\n\nHere we have that rarity, a new take on a familiar story which pays ample respect to its source, as I certainly recognised scenes and dialogue from the original, but goes its own way by not going the sensationalist route, building the tension gradually and yet still having enough savvy to drop in the effective final scene which the Production Code didn't permit Siegel to use back in 1956.\n\nThe film still has its own quirks, like the ominous synthesiser and percussion-based soundtrack which adds greatly to the atmosphere, the offbeat characterisations provided by Goldblum and Leonard Nimoy in particular as well as the unusual locations utilised such as the private baths owned by Goldblum and his wife and the tanker ship where Sutherland makes his big play to thwart the alien invasion.\n\nI think this would be a great subject for another remake in the wake of all our collective experiences in recent times but it would have to go a long way to surpass this fine example of how to make a good thing better."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never seen the original Invasion of the Bodysnatchers but I've long known of the basic set-up through its prodigious influence on genre cinema and writing. Its a terrific idea and endlessly adaptable, which is why there have been three remakes thus far and I'm sure more to come. This one is situated in late 70's San Francisco a fast moving affair with terrific effects work, fine performances and taut suspense steeped in the chilliest of post hippy bad vibes. Donald Sutherland is the hero of the piece, a Department of Health worker who gets involved in an ever escalating nightmare after his co-worker reports her husband acting, well, not himself. Sutherland is good value here, Democrat, skilled cook, able to laugh on his job, model public servant who smacks of free thought, while Brooke Adams is an ideal partner, bringing more of a early rising driven fear to the films earlier stages. As things move along they are joined in their growing awareness by Leonard Nimoy, Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright and the film offers some of its best moments here, quirk coming to the fore as the four players spark off each other. Apart from the largely stoic Nimoy, each brings a crackling live wire paranoia to their roles, Adams fearful, Sutherland methodical and Cartwright lively and loopy. Her character is the most far out of the group, an ancient aliens believer and she brings a memorable brightness to the role. One could hardly wish for a more engaging set to meet an individuality sapping menace and they do a great job of powering the film during some of its chase scene longueurs. Those slight lapses were my only real problem with the film, its action is never as interesting as its build up or its wondrous science fiction horror visuals. Fortunately the score keeps the atmosphere up even when the film seems to lag, with lots of nifty disturbing drones. Thematically the concern seems to be with the aftermath of the 60's, radicalism tapped into the mainstream, free thought consumed by quick solutions, societies encounter with such elements actually taking away its freedom. Notice that the aliens first spawn in the form of flowers, and especially the manner of the pod-peoples birth, illustrated in graphic fashion in a great, creepy sequence of obvious symbolism that I shall not reveal here. Altogether I thought this very fine stuff indeed, nightmarish situations, chilling atmosphere and powerful playing, virtually a must see for genre fans."

        "review_detailed_main": "Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a rare example of how remakes equal their originals. Now, having never seen the 50s original and only seeing the modern remake 'The Invasion', I was sceptical about the acclaim this received. How many times can the same novel be adapted and still be enthralling as the source material? Turns out several times. This was incredibly eerie and edgy for its time. A health inspector and his colleague are in the midst of a gradual alien invasion where the rest of society start to act differently than before. The epitome of portraying totalitarianism (I've always wanted to use that word in a review!) and how easily manipulated society can be at conforming to new regimes. It's a timeless and always relevant story that seamlessly blends sci-fi with politics. Creating true order from falsified order. The inability of the freedom to act, the relinquishment of feeling...just the loyal obedience to the \"bigger picture\". That being a flourishing gelatinous alien race taking over planets by duplicating their hosts once they fall to sleep. It plays out like a classic sci-fi, but the horror elements crop up occasionally. The first five minutes were surreal and entrancing, it reeled me in immediately. The slow revelatory build up during the first two acts were extremely well paced. The survival instincts in the third act kicked in and then executed one of the best twist endings in the history of cinema. Sutherland performed very naturally, his character was very lifelike in terms of the actions he took. Adams was slightly over the top and sporadically annoyed me as she stated the obvious consistently. Nice small roles from Nimoy and Goldblum also. Kaufman's gritty and experimental camerawork really was the stand out. His technique has resulted in a film that has aged impeccably well. Oh, and the evocative sound effects that range from screams to synthesised sci-fi noises were deliciously haunting. The screenplay feels derivative in certain aspects, as it tries too hard to detail character development. All I know is, I now need to watch the original!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The 1956 B-movie classic is given the big-budget Hollywood treatment--which means more money and bigger names--and would you know it, they actually managed to improve on the original.\n\nCommunist infiltration and Cold War paranoia is SO 1950s, so this time around the story about pods from outer space replacing earthlings with mindless automatons is set in the urban atmosphere of San Francisco and feeds off of the conspiracy theorist paranoia of a post-Watergate America. Director Philip Kaufman owes Roman Polanski a beer for borrowing the \"everyone is watching\" jittery camera work and wacky jazz music Polanski used to make \"Rosemary's Baby\" so nerve wracking, and I'm guessing the scene of Donald Sutherland panicking in a phone booth while suspicious strangers lurk outside is a direct homage.\n\nSutherland, with his afro and bug eyes, seems only one step removed from a space alien to begin with. Jeff Goldblum is present as well, and he becomes more normal after being cloned. One has to conclude, therefore, that the movie doesn't make much of a case for the human race being much worse off after an alien invasion. But it's a lot of fun, and does succeed in creating some creepy scenes, unlike the first one.\n\nAnd because this is the 70s and not the 50s, we get some extra bang for our buck: like some gratuitous boob shots (which come to think of it actually makes sense though, since it's not logical that replacement humans would be spit out of a giant seed pod fully clothed) and a bizarre scene featuring a dog with a man's head that licks his lips suggestively at our heroine. O.k. so that one's not really explained, but what finally IS explained in this version is what happens to the original human bodies once there's a cloned version of them walking around; they deflate like a punctured air mattress.\n\nNot really that scary, but a fun movie nonetheless.\n\nGrade: B"

It is a bit too slow, resulting in a sort of slump, which leaves time to notice some poorly thought sequences and precarious narrative devices.\n\nA very solid entry in the sci-fi genre nonetheless, and quite a fitting critique to our society."

There's also some truck outside their apartment for half the movie that is messing with their phone line or some stupid thing so it's as if they are somehow the only people in all of San Francisco that haven't been infected?

        "review_detailed_main": "I haven't seen the original 1956 version, but I saw this one last night, and I can tell you, it was a scary good time! Starting off with what I think is a scientifically brilliant alien invasion, the movie kicks off with Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) picking a flower and bringing it home. The next morning, her husband is \"different\", as she says. Many people begin to notice their spouses are \"different\" in the same way, and she goes to her friend Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) for help. As more and more people begin to get affected by this disease, they feel alone, and the suspense tightens, and the first appearance of a pod really puts things \"out there\".\n\nAll the performances are good, and I thought the two lead roles with Brooke Adams and Donald Sutherland were fantastic. They are part of a foursome that feels isolated, and these \"emotionless zombies\" seem to be closing in on them, and things are getting a little too hot for them. And they are aided by a mysterious psychiatrist who dismisses the whole \"alien invasion\", but for all they know, he could be one himself!\n\nThat's what makes the film so good. You don't always know whose good and who is bad. A lot of the people have obviously been \"snatched\", but some of the snatched seem to be smarter than the brainless zombies that are beginning to parade through the San Francisco streets, and that's where the film gets you thinking and gets you worried. While a lot of horror/thriller films are unsuccessful when they reveal their \"faceless\" monsters, this film is all around scary. The births of those who are being snatched is disturbing and disgusting, and the suspense of isolation is a dark tone that purges the film, making EVERYTHING scary.\n\nIt's not PG though. Yes, that's what it's rated, but in no way can it be viewed as a PG movie- it's really more like a strong PG-13. There is frequent scary scenes, disgusting and disturbing images, and some nudity. I thought that with this being PG it wouldn't be scary, but it was.\n\nI was excited to see the film, and was pleased when all was said and done. One of the best quotes in the film is when Nancy says, \"Maybe they are from outer space...you know they don't always have to come down in metal ships\". If there ever were an alien invasion and war on mankind, it wouldn't be in the form of giant metal ships that blast us with their ray guns. No, it could be something like this, and that's another reason why this movie is so terrifying and brilliant. It gave me chills. 7.6/10."

This might just be my own subjective experience however, as I am really used to watching movies that are more exploitative and shocking and over the top. Then again, it's almost two hours long. The camera work is absolutely gorgeous, very artistic and swift, and the locations are beautiful. It almost feels English for some reason. Another complaint I have is that it feels a bit like a soulless machine... gorgeous but without any real conviction or personality. And this is actually a problem I have with most Hollywood films from this decade. So many are like this, and it turns me off to them. But regardless, this would be one of the better ones.\n\nI do have to say that I feel like the cheap grindhouse films of the 70s are the better ones as far as American movies of the decade, they have more personality and touch.\n\nOverall though this movie is very good, it seems to be slightly more intellectual than the average hollywood thriller, it has some meat to it, even though it is fairly straightforward. Almost unbearable tension."

I personally felt that this took what the original gave us and made it even better. To be fair, though, this was the first one that I saw, and as a young boy, it captured my imagination and ran away with it - so, yes, it does hold sentimental value to me.\n\nOur main protagonist, Matthew Bennell (Sutherland), is a Health Department Inspector who's colleague, Elizabeth (played by Brooke Adams), believes that her live-in boyfriend is not really her boyfriend. We, as the viewer, are already clued in from the opening scenes that something has permeated Earth's atmosphere from outer space and attached itself to the vegetation creating a red flower - one of which Elizabeth takes home and places in a glass near their bed. As they come across others who make similar claims, it isn't long before Bennell, Elizabeth, and a young couple they are friends with, are all running for their very lives.\n\nThis was one of my favorite movies growing up, having just found a love for horror/thriller films. I was immediately pulled in and completely enamored with what I was watching onscreen. The acting was excellent, the cinematography was gritty but well done (and fitting to the overall feel of the movie), the story held my attention throughout, and the ending ... wow, what a great ending! Haunting and memorable. And that weird thing that Brooke Adams can do with her eyes? Yeah ...'nuff said.\n\nThis comes at a very high recommend. I loved this film. To me, it is clearly the best of the bunch and one I have seen numerous times. Besides, Leonard Nimoy was in it, and he plays such a despicable slimeball - LOL. And the original film's star, Kevin McCarthy, has an awesome cameo in it. I own it with pride and it is a classic in my home. 9 very strong stars out of 10 - an almost perfect film."

The film goes from a psychological thriller to a zombie movie in essence.\n\nThere were a couple strange and haunting moments sprinkled throughout but getting to them is the biggest problem, and then they aren't even long enough to care about. There's a romantic subplot that isn't very well-done. None of the characters are really likable.\n\nThe ending payoff isn't really great either.

        "review_detailed_main": "It seems like Donald Sutherland always chose these nice atmospheric horror films in the 70s and I congratulate him for it. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an enjoyable watch for its moody portrayal of San Francisco. The messaging, as far as I can tell, is a critique of corporate America - the idea of emotionless people replacing humans, claiming that it will advance civilization beyond its present state. The monsters also screamed like pigs to alert others when their conformity was challenged by a real human refusing rank and file. Whatever your analysis it works in an urban landscape full of yuppies, including the lifestyle of the main characters. They're all young urban professionals experiencing a bourgeoisie life but at what price?\n\nHowever, I have to stop there and cannot lavish praise too highly. In 2024 the plot is a bit thin and trite, seemingly reinforcing conspiracy theory types, so it isn't great. The enemy is vague enough in this film to be problematic. Also, the banjo dog was completely unnecessary. Suddenly the spell of the movie was broken; I was like \"hold up these are not serious people.\""

And along with a top notch cast, this almost makes you forget that you are in fact watching a horror flick. As the supernatural concept starts taking over - literally - the suspension of disbelief is somewhat challenged, but slowly but surely the film makes its way to your gut, not least thanks to exquisite prosthetic effects. Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams give committed, nuanced performances. And the director Philip Kaufman adds some hypnotic touches, especially in what turns out to be an exhilarating finale. There are fun cameos from Kevin McCarthy, who had played the lead as Dr. Miles Bennell in the original, and Robert Duvall as a crazed priest on a swing in the opening scene."

To caricature, let's face it, it's a bit like the Democratic version of Siegel's Republican film!\n\nBut Kaufman is keeping his initial goal in mind, namely to deliver a sophisticated, intelligent, efficient SF film that respects the basic material. The Donald Sutherland/Brooke Adams duo works particularly well. A good remake. 7/10."

The updated version really doesn't strike me as a veiled treaty on some important point, just a nice, scary film that will leave you terrified. And you know what? I'm very happy with that!\n\nThe cast is uniformly excellent, Brooke Adams, Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy all give great performances in much different roles. A mysterious organic substance comes to earth, and slowly begins to infect humans, first cocooning them, then releasing them into the world, as soulless zombies. Effects are great, acting is great, and the final 15 minutes might give you a heart attack! You'll know when you see it it is THAT well done. An all time classic!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Donald Sutherland, Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy, and. Brooke Adams (probably my all-time celeb crush. I can't breathe when she's talking on screen. She is so beautiful, cute, and energetic and sweet. ;_;). Anyway, all these stars and it's also shot in 70's San Francisco with tons of iconic shots. Just amazing visually.\n\nAnd yet, I didn't really enjoy the movie. For me, movies, books and TV shows exist because of stories. I like stories and I like a good story. \"Aliens invade earth\" is not a story, nor is it a plot. It's an event, it's a premise. The film lost my interest after about halfway through. First of all, there is no mystery. We know who has been body snatched and who hasn't, because the pod people don't have emotions. So there is no wondering about that. The only mystery is, will they somehow be able to avoid getting body snatched? Well for one thing, I don't really care. There wasn't enough time in the start of the film for the audience to form a meaningful attachment to the main characters. They are just good looking, talented actors to me. Obviously I know that they can't kill them all off, so to speak, but whether they become pod people doesn't concern me a ton.\n\nSo I have to say that I zoned out during the middle and I don't think I missed anything. Usually when I zone out in a movie I go back to see what I missed. In this case, because there was no story, only a premise (initial conflict) I knew I didn't miss anything because there is nothing to miss. I know the rest of the movie will be them trying to avoid becoming pod people and trying to either save the city / entire country (seems impossible) or at least escape.\n\nWhen I stopped zoning out, D Sutherland was smashing their base, which looked like a greenhouse with vines growing in it like we're outside a home depot. Wow, so easy, just smash some stuff on the rafters to save everyone. It's like a video game!\n\nThe reason why Get Out was so popular was because it broke the traditional stigma of the horror genre not having a story. It's not supposed to have a story, it's supposed to be campy and fun and something you don't have to pay attention to and can laugh and talk about while watching with friends.\n\nBut it's still a movie, and movies are stories, not just premises."

The film still stands out for its interesting cast including Donald Sutherland, Jeff Goldblum and Leonard Nimoy (who plays, to all intents and purposes, Mr. Spock without the ears); and for all its limitations, it still has some merit compared with modern equivalents that hide their lameness behind a gallery of superfluous special effects."

        "review_title": "The remake is never as good",
        "review_detailed_main": "My comments are directed to a comparison of this film and its original 1956 version, directed by Don Siegel. I've seen both versions twice, most recently on television, back to back. On second viewing, I liked the original more than I did the first time, and the remake less. I now think that the original is a near masterpiece, while the remake is much inferior. [new para.]\n\nOne reason is that the remake is a full 35 minutes longer than the original, which was only 80 minutes long. Of course, this is very typical of how movies have changed in those two decades: an audience today would feel cheated if they spent $14.00 for a movie less than an hour and a half long. The fact is, however, that for the telling of a single narrative about 90 minutes is plenty and nearly two hours is too long. [new para.]\n\nThe premise of both films is really quite simple: aliens invade earth in the form of spores, they grow in pods, they take over the bodies of humans and replace them, and their plan (presumably) is to take over the whole human race. The plot centres on the discovery of the conspiracy, and on whether or not the heroes can escape. [new para.]\n\nAnother reason is that the remake is full of special effects not present in the original, which has very few - and those few are not especially good. However, and this is another of my prejudices, there is almost an inverse relationship between F/X and dramatic impact. We know the body snatchers are hatching in pods. How they actually do it really doesn't matter. What is scary is that humans are becoming non-humans: they are losing their vital spirit, their emotions. The shots of half-formed pod-people is just yucky stuff; it's not truly frightening. [new para.]\n\nA third reason is that the musical score in the original is much superior. This is surprising: music in the 1950s usually was overdone. Here it's the more modern score that is overblown and calls attention to itself. Indeed, the sound effects and camera tricks indulged in by Philip Kaufman - although some are effective - are mostly distracting. Technically, I think Siegel is the better director, even though his style is much more traditional. Compare the chase scenes: Siegel's are better. [new para.]\n\nLastly - and this is the most important reason - the original has a resonance that simply cannot be attained in the remake because of the time in which each was made. It is crystal clear, regardless of the intention of the author of the novel, that the theme of the original is related to Americans' fear of Communism. That invests the plot with a terror that is much more convincing than the superficial one of aliens from outer space, which is all the remake has. There are clever cultural references in the remake to bring it up to date - particular having to do with pop psychology, but also with health and environmental concerns, and some crackpot scientific theories - but none carry any great weight that take the remake outside the genre. The ending, though creepy, thus cannot compare to the horrifying scene of Kevin McCarthy screaming \"you're next\" to disbelieving drivers on the highway, unaware that their freedom is about to be stolen."

The darkness was obviously on purpose, as it contrasted sharply with the brightness of the scary ending, but if I can't see, I can't give a darn.\n\nBut Donald Sutherland's performance is good and Jeff Goldblum is uncharacteristically understated.\n\nThings to watch for: the un-sexiest nude scene ever"

Where as the 1950s version was a standard B-movie, the remake features an excellent cast and film direction that raises it above the level of a typical sci-fi horror movie.\n\nIn particular, the film owes a heavy debt to the paranoia thrillers of the early to mid 1970s, such as Klute and All the President's Men. The use of camera angles and music to create an atmosphere of genuine dread is extremely skillful. Denny Zeitlin's synthesizer score is classic, and makes one wish he had done more film scores.\n\nThe cast, as mentioned above, is a stand out, and plays a major role in raising this film to the level of a classic. Donald Sutherland, as usual, gives a bravura performance, while Brooke Adams makes an appealing female lead. However, the true stand out of the cast is Veronica Cartwright, who plays a smarter than she seems sci-fi buff who knows an alien invasion when she sees one. The cast as a whole gives their characters an empathy which makes the viewer care."

Usually, I think it would be a mistake to monkey around and update a true classic. But here is one of the rarest of treats: a competent and artistic remake. Maybe, the best. The location change to San Francisco is ingenious. Even inspiring. Underrated Brook Adams is wonderful and carry's her own special effect around in her hip pocket: rolling and darting her big brown eyes back and forth like crazy ping pong balls. Amazing. Meanwhile, Donald Sutherland has his best part since he played \"Hawkeye\" in M*A*S*H. There are a slew of clever touches: breezy pinwheels, recoiling telephone cords, and upright dry cleaning presses; all of which fill the soundtrack with scary jolts and sharp noises. The Transamerica Pyramid looms over the entire film. In 1978, special effects were mounted in very real terms--nothing phony could be used to dress up a shot. Veronica Cartwright, a child actress who gave \"Beaver Cleaver\" on television his first smooch, has a beefy and star making turn as a ditsy urban dweller. Leonard Nimoy scores as the logical psychiatrist. No surprise there. And a youthful and lanky Jeff Goldblum jabbers away like a man on speed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Don Siegel's '50s sci-fi classic gets the '70s remake treatment, with Donald Sutherland starring as Matthew, a San Francisco health department inspector whose close friend Elizabeth (Brooke Adams) believes that her boyfriend Geoffrey (Art Hindle) has somehow been replaced by a duplicate devoid of emotion, and that others in the city are also not what they seem to be. Although sceptical at first, Matthew is convinced after he is called to examine a partially formed clone of his friend Jack Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum). As more and more people are replaced by unfeeling doppelgangers, Matthew and his pals correctly surmise that the planet is under attack by aliens.\n\nInvasion of the Bodysnatchers is a lesson in how to do a remake properly: the film takes the basic premise of the original, but smart changes here and there keep things fresh and interesting (the most notable being the switch of location from a sleepy town to a major city). The result is a creepy, ominous and occasionally freaky film (the dog with the human head has haunted me for years) that is hugely enjoyable, even for those who are very familiar with the original. The movie also benefits from a terrific cast (Leonard Nimoy, as psychiatrist Dr. David Kibner, proves that there is more to him than a pair of pointy ears, and Veronica Cartwright is excellent as Jack's wife Nancy), an unusual but effective score, great special effects (courtesy of Tom Burman), and a well-developed sense of unease that really helps to crank up the tension."

Alien pods are replacing human beings with robot-like replicants, and Kaufman does a great job at setting the scene: following believably eccentric San Franciscans through the city as mysterious flowers begin popping up all over the place! Curly-headed Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams are very companionable co-stars here, and Kaufman's energy-level starts high, but the film seems to get weighed down with its own minutiae. W.D. Richter's screenplay is hectic and muddled, and the picture scrambles around for an ending. Kaufman is vigilant that his version of this story will not conclude happily (as the studio-mandated original did); that's fine, but his conception, while at times admirable, is also dispiriting--and ugly instead of scary. **1/2 from ****"

There is a brilliant simplicity in the original, low budget but tight & effective. This remake shows you what can be done w/ money. Everything hinted at is seen in '78. Yet the plot & the tension take on commensurate sophistication and artistic ambiguity. Nimoy's gobbledygook explanation of why this horror is not really happening is one of the greatest things in the movies. It's a brilliant satire on self-help and feel-good pop psychology. Lord, do I wish Hollywood would come up w/ something so brilliant again..."

There's just something deeply unsettling about the whole movie, not to mention the ending, which will probably remain etched into my brain for the rest of my life. Makes me uncomfortable just thinking about it. Together with \"Jaws\" and \"Gremlins\", this is one of the films my parents shouldn't have let me watched. Anyway, there are so many movies today that are worth watching and probably better than this, but I'd still recommend it for a boring Sunday afternoon."

No, it does not, but this is a very, very good remake. Clearly, it's technically superior and the overall acting is probably better, but its problem is that it wants to be bigger and more in depth than the original and most of that involves one character, the psychiatrist. This remake follows the original very closely other than that character who feels more like filler here than anything else to me with all of his psychiatric mumbo jumbo trying to explain what's going on. Of course there is a reason for that, but that doesn't make it interesting. The original was lean and to the point and this is the opposite. There is much to enjoy here from the excellent cast to the incredibly eerie and effective sound effects throughout the film. Donald Sutherland is excellent and Brooke Adams has never been more appealing. Add in Veronica Cartwright matching her strong supporting turn in the film Alien and you've got a winning team. The small addition of Kevin McCarthy is perfect. This has been remade two other times, at least, and they are both musts to avoid. The tension is high here."

        "review_detailed_main": "Surrounded by friends and family and loved ones, but you're all alone. The world is being taken over and there is nothing for the characters to do but run. This suspense filled horror is a sweaty palm ride from start to finish. You don't know what is going to happen the movie gets you so wrapped up in what is happening you can't stop to think of the possible outcomes. In the city of san Francisco everyone is living their everyday lives but they start to notice something wrong with strangers and then friends and then family. The paranoia starts to build as you don't know what is going on and then the conspiracy against them is rising. There is a large rising fear along with the enemies among the crowd. Added to the list of favorite horror films. This movie does such a great job of leaving you as blind and scared as the characters not knowing if anyone you are talking to you can trust. It was really good with the exception of a few things. The character development is fine and it works for the film these are characters that are contempt with their lives but have that feeling of just wanting different or more and they end up getting that in the worst way possible. It worked for the film and I felt for them but it took a bit to get there. Another part that bothered me a little bit was the soundtrack. To me it felt like a video game soundtrack just a same tune that would intensify in danger. Where as films like The Thing, Jaws and The Shining all have great soundtracks that help carry the feeling and theme of the movie. So I thought it felt a little lackluster. The setting and costumes throughout the film was very real though. It all felt like it belonged and nothing was out of place, there were a few strange shots but that was because strange things were happening everywhere. A big part of this movie that I wasn't expecting to see a whole lot of was the special effects. It was very prominent for a lot of the scenes and it looked very alien and foreign and I guess since we haven't actually seen anything of the sort I cannot say that it doesn't look real. There was a scene or two of blood that felt a bit cheesy but it was effect nevertheless. One of my favorite parts of this film was the slight monotone voices of some of the background characters. It left so much in the air early in the film, making you question everything that is going on. A filming technique that I picked up on was the silence a lot of the time. There was some strange music throughout a lot of the film but there was a ton of silence just before the music. I enjoyed this very much it made for a very eerie feel for a lot of the film. One technique that I understood but felt was a bit out of place in the movie was the scene in which Donald Sutherland's character is trying to talk to someone about what is going on and the camera is zooming around creating a distressed feeling for him. I liked what it was going for but it felt out of place in the film. \"Jack Bellicec: It's a big conspiracy. Matthew Bennell: What's a conspiracy? Jack Bellicec: Everything.\" (W. D. Richter 1978). A huge message in the film was conspiracy and how it was you against the world with not escape. This feeling was shown very well through the constant worry and distress shown through the lead characters. Paranoia is a huge theme and feeling that is throughout a large portion of the film, it has so many little things that go on the just catches the eye of the main characters for a second making you stop and wonder what exactly is going on. I believe the main theme deals directly with the quote from the film that I used to title this review; Survival. All everyone is trying to do it survive and fit for their independence and be themselves. This is throughout the entire film they even start to lose hope that they will be able to fight back against the invasion but the characters know that they must continue to fight. This Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978 film has some technical flaws here and there but overall it is a very good horror film and it has one of the best movie endings I have ever seen, right up there with Keyser Soze from The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense. On a grading scale of A+ to F, I would give Invasion of the Body Snatchers a B+."

You really are wondering, who has been \u0091snatched' and who has not. OK this is neither an big explosion nor an extremely thrilling vehicle, but it keeps your attention. The best things in this film I think is the scene when Donald Sutherland falls asleep in the Yard and the end. The end really made me like this film and it was easy for me after it to give this film a 7, but I won't because as I said the rest of the film was not as convincingly good and it was not good all the time. But in the end I was extremely terrified. So this all summons up to a\n\n6,5 out of 10 (something is missing in this film)!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The second film version of Jack Finney's chilling sci-fi novel stars Donald Sutherland as Matthew Bennell, a public health inspector in San Francisco who becomes aware that a different sort of alien invasion is taking place. People are being replaced by emotionless duplicates that hatch from pods. He first becomes aware of the disaster when his good friend / co-worker Elizabeth (Brooke Adams) frets that her boyfriend (Art Hindle) is not the man he used to be. They hook up with Matthews' friends the Bellicecs (Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright) who discover one of the duplicates at their place of business, also seeking help from a pop psychiatrist (Leonard Nimoy).\n\nThe theme of the fear of the loss of individuality and of becoming part of a hive mind is still extremely resonant, with this adaptation (scripted by W. D. Richter, and directed by Philip Kaufman) slotting just as neatly into its decade as the first film version slotted into the 1950s. After all, the 1970s was a time ripe for themes of paranoia and conspiracies in motion pictures. The result is a story that is damn entertaining as well as intelligent, with this adaptation actually going the original one better in terms of its creepiness, imagery, and \"yuck\" factor (the excellent special effects were done by Thomas Burman and Edouard Henriques). The urban setting also injects some freshness into the tale since the first film version had taken place in a small town. \"Body Snatchers\" '78 does exceed the first films' running time by almost forty minutes, but never feels that long: this is one story that moves along VERY well, with no filler and one riveting sequence after another. The creepy music score by Denny Zeitlin (his only feature film score credit) is another asset.\n\nThe cast is uniformly wonderful. Sutherland and the lovely Adams are engaging leads. As always, Cartwright is one actress that does a superb job of conveying hysteria. Nimoy is aptly cast as a pragmatic, Spock-like character. Goldblum is fun to watch as usual. Fans of the first version will be quick to note the cameo appearances by star Kevin McCarthy (seeming to pick up where he left off) and director Don Siegel. (Robert Duvall, who'd co-starred in Kaufmans' first studio picture, \"The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid\", has a QUICK, unbilled, wordless cameo as a priest on a swing.)\n\nA worthy update of the material in every way; some fans even prefer this to the 1956 version. It would be followed by two more official adaptations, \"Body Snatchers\" in 1993, and \"The Invasion\" in 2007 (which also features Cartwright).\n\nA must for sci-fi fans. It's not to be missed, especially when you consider THAT ending / image, one of the most memorable of its kind.\n\nNine out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "On the short list of truly great horror/sci-fi remakes, one that often gets left out is the 1978 version of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\" Pre-dating John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" and David Cronenberg's \"The Fly\" (two films that set an extremely high bar for all other remakes), Director Philip Kaufman's take is the second adaptation of Jack Finney's novel, \"The Body Snatchers\" and is a real head-spinner, even forty years after its release. It's influence -- while not widely reflected on -- can be heavily felt in the sci-fi leaning pop culture landscape that would sprawl out in its wake.\n\nBoasting eye-popping special effects that still look amazing (and, at times, repulsive) even today, \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" is no doubt a cut above the average studio horror fare of the time, carrying an air of weight and sophistication that puts it in line with a film like Ridley Scott's \"Alien.\" Kaufman slowly but surely raises the tension and paranoia with a steady hand, effortlessly engaging the viewer from beginning to end with characters that look and feel real, caught up in a surreal experience that looks and feels like a waking nightmare. The film is as dread-filled as it is, at times, visually arresting. Of course, the film also boasts an impressive ensemble cast, lead by a heavily permed Donald Sutherland and a down-to-Earth and charming Brooke Adams. Rounding out the cast are Veronica Cartwright (also of \"Alien\"), Jeff Golblum giving it all the Jeff Goldblum he can give, and Leonard Nimoy, stepping away from Spock for a change of pace. All five main leads look and feel real, selling the dread perfectly, thus sealing the deal.\n\nThe kind of film that will leave certain images (and sounds) burned into your brain for years after the fact, \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" is absolute, must-see viewing for genre fans of all shapes and sizes. Kaufman's efforts have surely stood the test of time, and the movie just grabs you by the jugular and refuses to let up until its bone-chilling, music-less end credits. The term \"they don't make 'em like they used to\" sure gets thrown around a lot, but in this case it is more than apt. One of the best remakes of all- time and definitely one of the most criminally under-rated movies of its era in general."

Leonard Nimoy gives his best non-Spock performance as Dr. David Kibner, a psychiatrist (psychologist? I always get them confused) who doesn't believe in their wild stories even though there's really nothing that wild about them on the surface.\n\nSo, yes, everybody's changing. And it's all thanks to plantlike aliens that migrate to Earth on solar winds (explained here in a visually stunning opening sequence). Sadly, the action occasionally shifts to clunky, and Kibner's attitude really begins to irritate after a while. But kudos to everybody-- particularly Cartwright-- for helping to make this a highly memorable invasion."

They increasingly suspect that people are somehow being duplicated and trace the problem to alien plant pods. Leonard Nimoy plays Matthew's pop psychologist friend while Jeff Goldblum & Veronica Cartwright are on hand as a couple who run a mudbath parlour.\n\nThis could be viewed as a sequel rather than a remake. The entries in the series are as follows: \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1956); \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978); \"Body Snatchers\" (1993); and \"The Invasion\" (2007).\n\nThe first one is in Black & White and is probably too dated and tame for most modern viewers, but it's still worthwhile; it takes place in small town, California. This 1978 sequel switches the setting to the big city. The 1993 movie shifts to an army base in the deep south while the 2007 version switches back to the big city of Washington DC.\n\nThis rendition has a peculiar tone with a lot of the events taking place at night. There's a subdued eerie and dreary air with paranoia morphing into conspiratorial and then ghastly reality. The 70's atmosphere and cast are highlights, as is the score with its unnerving pieces. Brooke Adam's has exquisitely sculptured facial features (eyes, nose, lips, teeth, chin, cheeks and forehead). The creepy pod-birthing sequence in the garden is cogently done.\n\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 55 minutes and was shot in San Francisco. WRITER: W.D. Richter.\n\nGRADE: B"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Body Snatchers is a piece of original work re-invented in 1978 by Philip Kaufman with great analysis. The setting moves from a small town to a expedition in the city of San Francisco. Plant pods from the unknown make their presence valid by landing in one's backyard. Once picked and absorbed, the contents of the substance enters the bodily construction, renouncing a new developed specie. They travel like flies and everyone that makes contact is transformed into a non-feeling, zoned out living organism. Many are taken under, but I will not give into details of the victims. Story unfolds when Brooke Adams discovers a flower in her backyard and brings it into the house for boyfriend Art Hindle to see. The next morning, her boyfriend is somewhat \"Changed\" and Adams is confused from it. Soon after, she notices the whole town has changed... like a cold take over of the soul. She tells Donald Sutherland about her dilemma and they set out to find information. This in turn, leads to a great adventure of humans versus alien abductors through out the city. This is a mix of suspense and thrills that should enchant the mystery minded individual. The original was first predicated with Kevin McCarthy running through out both films. A really cool idea. If you want more on this puzzle linked film, check it out when possible. It is a second-rate classic."

After watching the movie (which I enjoyed very much) it drew my attention to the original 50s classic made by the great director Don Siegel. Once again I found myself engrossed in the story. Both movies feature the emotions people feel in a disaster situation. Both movies also featured great character development, although I still think the remake does more so considering its length. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is possibly the greatest sci-fi/horror flick I've seen."

        "review_detailed_main": "Synopsis: Remake of the sci-fi classic transplants the story from small town California to San Francisco. A health inspector and his small, intimate circle of friends begin noticing bizarre behavior of their fellow citizens when they start showing no emotion. They uncover a conspiracy to wipe out the human race with clones completely free of emotion. This race of beings are descending upon them fast as day by day, the city by the Bay is becoming headquarters for the clones.\n\nReview: Absolutely creepy in the way it's told. Philip Kaufman and the writing team have crafted a seriously creepy film that has a few deft touches to it. It still maintains a somewhat faithful storyline, taking the characters from the original and putting them in San Francisco, many of the plot conventions that happened with the Siegel version are put in, and a few new touches are put in. There's more of an emphasis on paranoia, as strange people become the eyes and ears of the city. Donald Sutherland is impressive in his role as the less than likable to restaurants health inspector. He provides the soul of a character who doesn't realize the rope he's hanging on is getting smaller by the minute. Leonard Nimoy breaks typecasting as a sympathetic doctor who may not be who he seems to be anymore. Brooke Adams provides the right chemistry to Sutherland's lead character as a sensitive scientist becoming aware of her own boyfriend's odd behavior. Jeff Goldblum before he became famous (or joined a gym) is well cast as the uptight friend with Veronica Cartwright as his uptight wife. The ending is a real surprise and there are some seriously creepy sequences. Look fast for Robert Duvall in a non-speaking role as well as the film's original star and director, Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel. Director Philip Kaufman pops up twice as the voice of a city official on a phone, and you'll see him as a man with a hat who walks up to Donald Sutherland in a phone booth. Very creepy, and an ending just as shocking as what the original's intended version would have been.\n\nGrade: B+"

        "review_detailed_main": "25 years ago, I saw this movie as a teenager. Now I work near the Dept. of Health building where several scenes take place, so I thought it would be a kick to watch again (for about the 6th time). Once again, I was struck by how strong this thriller is and how it's themes and sense of dread have become stronger over time.\n\nThe original from the 50's was a great parable for the Cold War (your neighbors can't be trusted, conformity is the enemy, the film could actually be claimed by both schools of thought as a metaphor, that is a true sign of greatness). This version by Phil Kaufman and screenwriter W.D. Richter ups the ante on the paranoia factor by moving the action from small town U.S.A. to big diverse city. In a big city people become insular, relating to few, and knowing fewer. Thus, the concept of an underground, or hidden, movement working behind the scenes becomes all too real. People are chased down the street and witnesses simply stare, if that. The desire to assist the authorities turns into a struggle against the system. If alien invaders (or in our modern society - terrorist factions) were to suddenly absorb individuals in a big city, I imagine it would happen just as it does in this film. Quietly and under our noses. We'd see strange things, but dismiss it as our imagination getting the better of us. And all the while, those with influential positions could easily be part of the menace and easily use their position to complete the takeover. Images of cultivation plants in remote areas and cargo ships in deserted shipyards being loaded with pods says it all; there would be no way to stop the process.\n\nThe movie works on all levels. It's suspenseful, has moments of humor, quality acting and production values, fun cameos (Robert Duvall, Kevin McCarthy, etc.), a great ambient score, effects that still look pretty damn good, and a great shocker ending. They don't make genre pictures like this anymore. An interesting footnote; just weeks prior to the film's release, San Francisco was hit by two tragedies, the mass suicide of the Peoples Temple and the assassination of Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Milk at City Hall. This must have dealt an unnatural eeriness to Bay Area audiences still reeling from real life events while watching scenes of their city fall to unseen invaders operating out in the open in front of the same City Hall."

The inescapable `fear' of the '56 version weakens because of this, but cast and crew still manage to create an extremely tense atmosphere and a blood-rushing tempo. Of course, the terrific cast also contributes to the high quality status of this film. The charismatic Donald Sutherland and the stunningly beautiful Brooke Adams make a great film couple and they receive excellent feedback from top-actors and actresses like Jeff Goldblum, Veronica Cartwright and Leonard `Spock' Nimoy! Matthew (Sutherland) and Elizabeth (Adams) are good friends and colleagues at the Health Department. One day, Elizabeth takes home an unknown species of flowers and their lives start to change dramatically. It seems like all kind of inhabitants of San Francisco are going through a bizarre metamorphosis all of a sudden. Their bodies still walk and talk, but all emotions and feelings seem vanished. Elizabeth slowly succeeds in convincing her friends something strange is happening! And how\u0085 people seem to turn into pod-people while they're asleep! An exact duplicate is growing while you're asleep, waiting to take in your displace you!\n\nThe basic plot (based on Jack Finney's novel) is ultra fascinating and very believable, even though it contains far fetched extraterrestrial aspects. Fact is, if you're completely living yourself in to this film\u0085there's a good change you'll be terrified. Kaufman brilliantly causes fear with simple methods. There isn't much musical guidance in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but there's excellent usage of natural noises like heartbeats, hearth fire or just\u0085silence. Also, long shots and pans of one interior, which really increases the tension second by second. The majority of `scares' in Invasion is caused by the compelling and suspenseful storyline, yet some sequences are purely horrific with awesome use of special and make-up effects. Never gross or anything, but definitely uncomfortable to look at. The high-rate quality of this film keeps on rushing buy and there isn't a dip or unnecessary moment to detect! Even the few sentimental sequences don't seem forced! Kaufman's film is a perfect and memorable wholesome, which includes all the necessary elements to form a classic in its genre. If you're looking for an adrenalin-filled film experience, you found it here.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers is a great remake! Director of the original \u0096 Don Siegel \u0096 obviously thoughts so too, otherwise he wouldn't have agreed on playing a small role in it, don't you think? Keep your eyes open for him, as he shortly appears as the vicious cabdriver. Decent horror remakes are rare, but this one is the perfect proof to state it's possible. Along with John Carpenter `The Thing' and David Cronenberg's `The Fly'; it's one of the few films that actually pay tribute to the original, instead of ruining it. The classic novel received another update in 1993, directed by Abel Ferrera this time. Even though he clearly is an over-talented filmmaker (Driller Killer, The Addiction), his version of the story lacks the tension and audience involvement of its predecessors."

        "review_detailed_main": "This remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers starts off really slow and compared to the original is inferior. The last half saves it from being a total flop, but it still a very average attempt at retelling the story of the body snatchers. The plot is of course that people are being replaced by replicas grown in plant like pods. It is up to Donald Sutherland's character and three others to escape the pod people and to try to save the world from an emotionless existence.\n\nI'll start with what I didn't like. I didn't like the first hour or so of this remake. I felt it to be very dry, very dull and slow moving. Things that should have kept my attention never really did. Being a huge fan of the original, it was really disappointing to see a remake made in 1978 to be so average. It could have been much better. I thought the acting was average. This movie was filled with good actors that just seemed so off for their roles. I did however enjoy the cameo of Kevin McCarthy who was in the original. Very well done scene of him trying to warn people that the \"pod people\" were coming.\n\nWhat really got my attention was when Matthew (Sutherland) and his friends were asleep and they were almost duplicated right in front of our eyes. That was such a dramatic and jaw dropping scene. The special effects were actually well done for that scene as well. After that scene, the movie picked up at a great pace, the chase was on. I loved the try to survive aspect of this and the original movie. You literally cannot trust anyone in the city. And if the pod people see you, they let out this piercing scream to let the others know where you are. I liked that addition to the movie.\n\nThere was of course the famous \"twist\" or shock ending as well which I liked. Overall a decent remake to a true classic. I still love the original over this one by far. The 1956 version did a great job at character build up. We saw the change in the townsfolk more, and it helped make the first half of that movie interesting to watch. Invasion 1978 failed to get my interest for a large part of the first half, but did save itself by having a very strong finish.\n\n6/10"

The film updates the story to incorporate the 70s. The horror is turned up a notch. Donald Sutherland is very believable and is the perfect pairing for Brooke Adams. Veronica Cartwright always stands out as the over wrought character that still keeps it together. I've seen it many times and every time I'm surprised how well it's held up.

        "review_detailed_main": "Remakes are inevitably compared with the original. Is that a condemnation for the practice of making remakes? Not necessarily, although I don't think any producer would dare try to remake Citizen Kane, Casablanca or The Third Man (I'm ignoring those atrocious TV productions of the second and third; they just don't count).\n\nThis film, of course, is a remake of a great black and white sci-fi classic, that had Kevin McCarthy (in his heyday) and Don Siegel (of Dirty Harry fame) as the director. I liked that original, but I didn't particularly like this one when I finally got to see it this year (2006).\n\nDonald Sutherland is always good, of course, and he does acquit himself well as one of San Francisco's health inspectors; Brooke Adams has never impressed me with her acting skills, but in this she turns in a surprisingly good performance; Jeff Goldblum again brings arrogance (he does it so well) to the role of a psychiatrist; and Veronica Cartwright is one of the few female actors who can perform 'the terrified female' without bathos or camp (who can forget her performance in Alien?). Leonard Nimoy, I'm afraid, is always Spock for me, no matter what he does.\n\nSo, why do I dislike this effort? To answer that, I must hark back to the original that, according to most sources, was a thinly disguised warning of what was viewed, by 1950s authorities, as the Communist menace. Perhaps it was, but it should also be recalled that, at that time, the UFO craze was well in place, project Blue Book was under way and Area 51 was just a vague rumor. So, was Don Siegel et al just cashing in on the then current crop of talking points? Who knows? But, after seeing that movie, I was certain that most would see it as just Another Scary Movie for the times (recall the 1951 version of The Thing From Another World).\n\nThis 1978 remake, however, cannot fall back on any of that communist or UFO mumbo-jumbo as its underlying theme, or message, if you will. So, if there is a message in this one, what is it? The only thing that makes any sense as a message is: an indictment of All Pervasive Authority (aka Big Brother is watching you), which ironically begins with Sutherland as a health inspector who trolls through the city's restaurants, giving and receiving abuse. So, is this remake trying to take itself seriously? It would seem so, and it's probably that aspect that is jarring for me.\n\nThat's not to say that the film is not done well: it is. I liked the cinematography, particularly the dark interiors and a nicely done sequence as Sutherland rescues Adams from the clutches of her boy friend. The special effects were great \u0096 and gory. The original score is effective but often unrelenting in its discordant sounds; hence, it tended to intrude on the narrative (I turned the sound down often to soften it). And the cameos by Kevin McCarthy, Don Siegel and Robert Duvall were a nice touch. But, the story is pure sci-fi and should be viewed as such: just Another Scary Movie.\n\nNow, if you want a movie about Big Brother, go see 1984."

        "review_detailed_main": "To begin, the first film that was released in the fifties was more of a condemnation of marijuana, with the \"Seed Pods\" and the San Francisco backdrop adding to the message that you will lose your individuality from consuming cannabis. While I can actually agree with that sentiment (I do consume Pot), it was a good film that set the foundation for this better and much scarier version.\n\nIn many ways it's somewhat of a sequel. The pod people have yet to take over San Fransisco completely, and 20 odd years later, McCarthy is still a human and running around like a mad man trying to convince everyone that they are in danger, with his short and memorable cameo. So if you were to have a double feature with the original and this version, it would not be overkill.\n\nHowever in this day and age they both speak of a world were individuality is under attack, and the result is not pretty, for anyone.\n\nUnlike the first film, with it's cookie cutter characters, each of the primary actors here give us strong color and contrast to the situation afoot. Nimoy, Goldblum, Cartright, Sutherland, Adams and even the homeless guy with the dog are unforgettable. I can still see that dog which has given me nightmares for over forty years.\n\nWrapping it all together is Jazz composer Denny Zeitlan's amazingly effective score, which holds it's own against other horror greats such as Gil Mell\u00e9 and even Franz Waxman, who likely was his primary inspiration considering it has the same demonic \"joy\" we felt in Waxman's \"Bride of Frankenstein\" at the film's climax. Understated through much of the first 3/4s of the film and with no real denoument, it follows the aliens like a broken ice cream truck melody that keeps us chilled to the bone.\n\nAll of the actors are at the top of their game in this movie, as they should be, projecting strong personalities that fade away through the progress of the alien invasion, and it truly is a treat to behold how they devolve into unfamiliar automotons.\n\nThe makeup effects are good but not gorey, and the use of sound is more effective than most of the visual elements in my opinion, such as the sound of the alien screams, which have yet to be surpassed, with the possible exception of the alien creature in John Carpenter's \"The Thing\", another body snatcher movie by the way.\n\nAfter so many years it feels almost criminal that this Body Snatcher is not praised more, because it has a quality that I believe is intelligent and unique, as well as chilling."

An effective opening, a classic closer, and a terrific nod to The Mephisto Waltz justify this enjoyable though over extended remake. The original at only 80 minutes long was quietly menacing, had the feel of a waking nightmare and effectively used it's small town setting. The 1978 film features too many scenes of people being chased by shrieking crowds and an over reliance on special effects without any real payoff, and after the first hour, the story slows down, becomes repetitive and coasts to that aforementioned closer. Goldblum and Cartwright are standouts while the leads are merely adequate and Leonard Nimoy as the psychiatric voice of reason feels so expendable. The film is more diverting than the other 2 remakes which followed."

I mean, Larry Gates vs. Leonard Nimoy? No contest.\n\n2) More disturbing details to get under your skin and actually make you uneasy in this version like the dog with a man's head and the stares of the various pods, particularly in the beginning when Brooke Adams and Donald Sutherland aren't noticing.\n\n1) San Francisco, as any Hitchcock fan'll tell you, is both prettier and creepier than Los Angeles."

        "review_detailed_main": "After discovering a strange flower pod and taking it home, health department agent Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) notices her partner Geoffrey (Art Hindle) acting strangely. She follows him, watching him meet up with similarly morbid characters exchanging packages. It is only her work partner Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) who seems to take her seriously. He takes her to meet intellectual psychiatrist David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy), who thinks she has convinced herself of this due to a breakdown in communication between her and Geoffrey. Only when Matthew's friend Jack (Jeff Goldblum) discovers a re-animating body of himself at his work, does the truth hit Matthew, and the group, along with Jack's wife Nancy (Veronica Cartwright), flee to escape the alien onslaught.\n\nAnyone who has seen Don Siegel's 1956 original, which was based on Jack Finney's 1955 novel, will know that the plot serves as a metaphorical interpretation of the U.S.'s political attitudes to communism, which they felt was attacking their countries democratic idealism. Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake abandons this intriguing premise in favour of something more straight-laced and old-fashioned. Not that this is a bad thing, as although inferior to Siegel's version, Invasion... is still a highly entertaining horror, that takes its time in the early stages to establish a foundation of impending dread, and to develop the main characters. This was an aspect that was prevalent throughout 1970's horror movies, with respected directors taking on the genre, and bringing their own artistic aesthetics and embedding them on screen.\n\nIt is after the first 50 minutes or so when the film seems to abandon this approach to pursue a more relentless, panicked tone, as the film descends into a chase movie. It was this aspect that brought the film down a peg or two for me, as it seemed to almost sell-out on its atmospheric openings, and resort to more action-orientated tactics, with repetitive scenes of fleeing and hiding. Interestingly though, the camera-work shifts from calm and slow-moving, to hand-held and loose just as things get frantic, a similar approach directors Nicolas Roeg and Roman Polanski would take in their masterpieces Don't Look Now (1973) and Chinatown (1974), respectively.\n\nBut, like I said earlier, the film is undoubtedly entertaining, and has plenty of homages to the original (stars Robert Duvall and Kevin McCarthy put in cameo appearances - the latter shouting \"they're here!\" in the street as if wandered over from the climax of the original), and, differently from the novel, stays true to the original's depressing and unresolved ending, the final image now being somewhat iconic in the world of horror. There are plenty of better films from the era of a similar ilk, but Invasion... remains extremely watchable, and unashamedly B-movieish in its execution.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is an essential for the feeling one can enjoy from the right kind of horror or sci-fi movie that makes you just want to snuggle up in front of the TV late at night or on a really rainy or snowy day when no one's around, have everything you need within arm's reach of the couch or comfy chair accompanied by a close ottoman you're camping out on, and lose yourself in it's eerily fun atmosphere. It is several times better than the original, which was treated with an unbearable lightness, virtually as if it were a romantic comedy. Philip Kaufman, the director of this 1978 version, gives the film a fast-paced yet homey style that includes the dynamic cinematography and music that make the exact type of film it is work.\n\nThis version does not have the ideal atmosphere for a straight horror movie, but a sci-fi film. It makes us feel the way we want to feel before watching a movie like Forbidden Planet or The Day the Earth Stood Still or The Invisible Man or, actually, like the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers. And in a good, cozy, eerie sci-fi film on a late October or November night, unlike the right horror film, it's great to have a cast of actors with particularly amiable presence, which this film has, such as Donald Sutherland as the modest, practical, and analytical hero, and Jeff Goldblum as Jeff Goldblum, which is absolutely no criticism, because that is exactly what I want to see from Jeff Goldblum. However, Brooke Adams, whose performance is fine if not a highlight like Sutherland's or Goldblum's, looks quite remarkably like Karen Allen.\n\nTo me, this version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is atmospherically, stylistically, and tonally the ideal traditional American sci-fi film."

But pretty soon after that the film settles in to a moody, creepy and watchable groove. The slow turn of the apocalypse is fun to watch as it unfolds. It's surprisingly brisk film for the most part, and the leads are charismatic and accomplished. There's a strange sort of unspoken chemistry between leads that I enjoyed and the supporting cast may have in many ways set the trend of horror film casting with a wide-eyed, already slightly odd-looking cast that are all brilliant in this sort of horror film. I enjoyed seeing Brooke Adams from Badlands playing the right levels of intelligence and squeamishness as befits a sci-fi horror chase film. The title of the film gives basically everything away, which I find interesting as it frees the film up to give you a focussed, personal experience amidst these events instead of something more global, a little like the World War Z movie could use the lexicon of zombies and global politics to create a singular intimate story (for better or worse). With this revealing title, Body Snatchers has the luxury of neither explaining or examining too deeply or too sparsely. And when conversations about the science begin, it seems more believable than even some of its contemporaries, even if the actual science doesn't bear thinking about. To say nothing of the dog with a human face, a moment so surprising and left field that I completely believe it within the context of the film that it could lead to them breaking character, it's so weird and ugly. The film is genuinely creepy and bleak. The three pod people growing while they all sleep is gruesome and the lack of clear answers on the alien methodology sort of enhances the otherworldliness. It's a little protracted towards the last half but still has a dynamite ending. I'm sure these days they'd try and cram in a happy ending, see: I Am Legend, but they felt like they didn't deserve it in the late 70's and I'm not sure we deserve one now."

        "review_detailed_main": "I haven't seen Philip Kaufman's (\"The Right Stuff\") supremely chilling 1978 movie in thirty years, so the 2007 DVD is a great excuse to revisit one of the most atmospheric and thematically intriguing sci-fi thrillers I have ever seen. Ostensibly a remake of the low-budget 1956 classic, this version foregoes the former's allegorical references to the then-prevalent Red Scare in favor of a post-Watergate mindset of escalating urban paranoia set most appropriately in the Mecca of acceptable non-conformity, San Francisco. Kaufman and cinematographer Michael Chapman (\"Raging Bull\") effectively evoke an off-kilter world overtaken by an encroaching sense of disquiet with a heavy use of crooked camera angles and elongated shadows that make the film downright noirish. Moreover, thanks to W.D. Richter's sharp screenplay, the film has a hip, almost blackly comic tone that makes a nice contrast to the scarifying situation being depicted. Overall, I find this film more entertaining than the original.\n\nThe macabre plot begins with health inspector Matthew Bennell and his colleague Elizabeth Driscoll, who encounter a strange, unidentifiable flower they see growing everywhere. At the same time, people all over the city, including Elizabeth's boyfriend and the local dry cleaner, are acting peculiarly distant and devoid of emotion. It eventually dawns on Matthew and Elizabeth that aliens in the form of plant pods are slowly replacing the local populace with robotic duplicates. Accompanied by their mud-bath-owning friends Jack and Nancy Bellicec, they are determined to find a way to escape the city before they fall asleep and become transformed into pod-derived automatons. What makes this version particularly compelling is the palpable idea that you can live in a city amid thousands of indifferent strangers and see how easily an increasing army of pod people can infiltrate it without much resistance. Even though the method of dehumanization is far-fetched, the theme resonates because the macro-level trend is happening in a more figurative sense even more now than in 1978.\n\nYou wouldn't expect the acting to be noteworthy in what may seem like a genre thriller, but the offbeat cast is razor-sharp. As Matthew, Donald Sutherland effectively plays an uncharacteristically sympathetic part, and his eccentric screen persona works particularly well in this context. Coming off of Terence Malick's acclaimed \"Days of Heaven\", Brooke Adams, with her distinctively throaty voice, gives a smart, watchful performance as Elizabeth, the character who first notices that something is amiss. The interplay between Sutherland and Adams has a quirky-funny chemistry that brings an unexpected comic element to the film. Jeff Goldblum (\"The Fly\") and Veronica Cartwright (\"Alien\") are no strangers to this genre, and they play Jack and Nancy with customary skill. Even Leonard Nimoy lends credibility as the know-it-all psychiatrist David Kibner, who tries to convince everyone that the strange goings-on reflect a mass psychological delusion. We know that's not true, and the scenes of the pod transformations, especially the key one in Bennell's garden, have that uniquely phantasmagoric effect that manages to be gross, scary and oddly amusing at the same time. Ironically, the film sags somewhat during the overextended chase scenes, and the piercing screams of the pods seem like a conventional touch for such a unique work. However, the final few minutes are well worth the wait. I live a few minutes away from the locale of that final shot, and I can't tell you how many times my friends and I have replicated that scene.\n\nThe two-disc 2007 DVD is a welcome package of an under-appreciated film. The first disc provides the movie with an optional commentary track from Kaufman, a holdover from the original 1998 DVD. Kaufman is relatively low-key in his recollections, but he provides insight into the film's underlying themes, the creativity he had to encourage to produce the low-budget special effects, the challenge of using San Francisco locations, and the inclusion of cameos from Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel, the star and director of the 1956 original. The second disc contains four featurettes, as well as the original theatrical trailer. The first is a cheeky retrospective look at the production, the sixteen-minute \"Re-Visitors from Outer Space, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Pod\", which describes Kaufman's rationale and approach in updating the 1956 original. Kaufman, Sutherland and Cartwright, among others, are interviewed. The second short is not as interesting, \"Practical Magic: The Special Effects Pod\", only five minutes long, which gives a cursory look at how some of the special effects were created before the convenience of CGI. Sound designer Ben Burtt is the subject of the third short, \"The Man Behind the Scream: The Sound Effects Pod\", as he explains how he created the gaseous pod-birthing noises and the unique scream of the pod people when they identify unaltered humans. Chapman discloses the influence of film noir in his camera-work in the five-minute \"The Invasion Will Be Televised: The Cinematography Pod\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "As has been made apparent to us before, creating a worthy book-to-film adaptation is very difficult. That being said, remaking a model book-to-film adaptation is nearly impossible. Philip Kaufman, award-winning director and gifted screenwriter, upgrades on Siegel's adaptation \u0096 also called 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' \u0096 of Jack Finney's 1955 sci-fi novel, 'The Body Snatchers,' while simultaneously offering homage to it. This longer, more in-depth remake also expands on the terror of the first, creating a more modern visual exploration of what scares us the most: a worldwide conspiracy, in which we are the ones everyone's out to get.\n\nKaufman's film, similar to Siegel's, focuses on a health inspector named Matthew Bennell (Dr. Miles Bennell in the original), played by Donald Sutherland, who, along with co-worker Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) and friends Jack and Nancy Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright), realizes that citizens of the San Francisco area, where he lives, are being duplicated by alien pods, which copy their human victims while they sleep, then discard their bodies. As the invasion spreads sporadically, Bennell tries to inform others of his terrifying discovery, only to find that everyone already knows\u0085 and is a part of it.\n\nMasterful in the art of adaptation, Kaufman gives this translation what original novelist Jack Finney envisioned while writing his paranoid classic: fear, suspense and temperamental anxiety. Sutherland and Adams share the spotlight and both do so very convincingly, whereas Jeff Goldblum, expert on paranoid studies ('The Fly,' 'Jurassic Park'), gives the film a necessary idiosyncratic character, contributing much of the film's humor, whilst heightening it's level of neurosis.\n\nPhilip Kaufman's 'Invasion' has set a precedent for how a remake should be \u0096 advanced, though respectful to its predecessor. Not taking anything from the '56 version, which still stands as one of American cinema's most monumental achievements, Kaufman's deft writing ability heaves this remake to the top of the seventies' sci-fi list in an era shared with definitive masterpieces such as Ridley Scott's 'Alien,' and Tarkovsky's 'Stalker.' Embrace the apprehension that the film strives for, for if you do, you, too, will begin to see the world through skeptical, suspicious, and very terrified eyes; and you'll love it!"

Able to adapt the spore invasion takes the form of alien clones, taking over the memory and body of the host, leaving but an empty shell. The new human is devoid of independent emotion, hollow and focused on base survival. Among the first to notice changes occurring in people is Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams), whose lifetime partner Geoffrey Howell (Art Hindle) overnight changes from obstinate and excessively easy-going to orderly and focused. Elizabeth shares her doubts with her friend and co-worker at the Department of Health in San Francisco Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland). Soon together with their friends Jack (Jeff Goldblum) and Nancy Bellicec (Veronica Cartwright) become overwhelmed by the paranoia of being the only ones left...\n\nA dreadfully terrifying vision, the most subliminal in sci-fi history, allows \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" thrive through time, in a large part due to the unapologetically dark script coupled with grim settings and an unrelenting sense of detachment from reality. Grabbing under the skin with the sense of no escape and a growing terror of encirclement, the movie has lost none of its gripping appeal. Gloomy cinematography and special effects as if taken from the most disturbing Cronenberg body horror designs it remains an undying classic, unrivalled by future instalments. Gliding shots through alleys following feet of nameless clones counter-played with subtle lighting brings out an unmistakable dread as the heroes become increasingly cornered.\n\nThat comes irregardless of sub-textual messages on society, including in my opinion the most timeless dilemma of the mass, the crowd syphoning emotion, diversity and inner innovation, subverting even the strongest individual into its machinations. Who an I? Is that question really relevant in the mass? Or is survival and the context of 'Who are we?' the only intuitively important question? Still one of the most efficient horror movies ever made, causing the skin to crawl and subconsciously forcing a short analysis of your loved ones as to whether they are still who they claim to be... :)"

Even though the plot was the same, there was enough going on to keep me entertained. Another good performance by Sutherland, and all the extras were quite good. The big difference in the two, was that I wasn't afraid to go to sleep after watching this one. Perhaps it's just a sign of the times. Maybe we are not so paranoid nowadays. Jeff Goldblum didn't look so Tall in this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Well why not a space flower? Why do we always expect metal ships?\"\n\nSince its publication in 1955, Jack Finney's Sci-Fi novel has been adapted many times for the big screen. The first adaptation was directed an year later by Don Siegel starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. The story took place entirely in a small Alabama town where some of the locals began mysteriously behaving in strange and detached manners, but more than twenty years later Philip Kaufman decided to remake this film and relocate the story in the populated city of San Francisco instead. The circumstances were different and the underlying political themes weren't necessary so this film focused entirely on the growing sense of paranoia behind the invasion. The mystery element is gone here, because from the very first scene we witness how this strange organic life form, similar to gel spores, begins drifting from a far away planet through space until it reaches our atmosphere and is washed down by rain in San Francisco. Here the spores develop into plants with pink flowers and the people who come into contact with them begin behaving in strange ways, which is of course a result of this life form taking over the bodies. The first to notice the change is Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) who shares her concern with co-worker, Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland), a public health inspector. She tells him that her husband has begun to act in a very mysterious manner and that he seems detached from any emotion. Matthew recommends she talk with his friend, David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy), a renown psychiatrist. When Elizabeth goes to speak with him, David mentions that other people have come up to him with similar concerns. Their fears are confirmed when Matthew's friends, Jack (Jeff Goldblum) and Nancy (Veronica Cartwright) discover a strange corpse that is being formed by the plant to duplicate one of them. By this time the invasion is in full force in the city and they must find a way to escape before it's too late.\n\nThe original film was already considered to be quite good, but this remake is probably the most referred to when mentioning Finney's novel. All the other adaptations after this one haven't met the same reception. The way in which cinematographer, Michael Chapman, shot the film gave it a much more disturbing atmosphere with the skewed angles, deep compositions, and dark shadows which only adds to the bizarre qualities of the film. It is an eerie sci-fi movie with some memorable sequences (who can forget the moment that mutant dog with a human face suddenly shows up on screen?) and you never know what direction the story is going to go. Unfortunately the film is a bit outdated and the effects don't look as great. The performances are solid, but sometimes they were over sold. Invasion of the Body Snatchers wasn't as fun as I had anticipated it to be, and the pacing began to drag at times. I probably would've enjoyed this film more if I had seen it several years ago, but by now the plot is overly familiar so the suspense and the scares don't work as well.\n\nDonald Sutherland and Brooke Adams play the two lead characters and they manage to engage the audience and allow us to sympathize with their cause. Adams is especially cute here and she can move her eyes like no one else. Nimoy gets a very conventional role and his character doesn't do much for the film. We've seen Goldblum play very similar roles as well and he did manage to get on my nerves during some of his freak out scenes. The cast delivers, but they were all far from being memorable. I can imagine the story freaked audiences out during the 70's and 80's, but for today's standards it isn't as effective.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "The film is very simple to enjoy. There are no major plot twists that can over complicate some stories. This film stays true to its origins. However in the 1956 film the invasion began in a small town and in this film it moves to the big city of San Francisco. This film also plays on the psychology craze that seemed to sweep the nation between the mid 60's and early 80's. Apparently for a while shrinks were the in crowd. I try dealing with them but they just keep wanting to lock me up. It is a conspiracy. Anyway this film is easy to watch and good if your wanting just a hint of horror and mostly looking to feed on nostalgia.\n\nThe action was pretty weak and the sci-fi was almost non existent at times. The few times that special effects did play out full on in this film was worth it. The scene of the pods giving birth to the doubles is both organic and entertaining. Mostly this picture relies on the cast to act out with emotion and later without emotion to convey the thrills across to the audience. I don't think that it came off quite how the director intended. At times Donald Sutherland looks more like a psycho perv than an emotionally concerned citizen. He definitely didn't know the term \"personal space\" because he all but crotch rocks Brook Adams in almost every scene they share. Which is a lot because hey!- I noticed!.\n\nLeonard Nemoy's character is spot on as a psychiatrist and Jeff Goldblum is almost watchable. This version is almost like watching the more recent adaptation with Nicole Kidman except you don't have to endure Nicole. She ruined \"Invasion\" for me! One of my favorite stories of all time. All in all this film is watchable and I enjoyed it for what it was- cheeky fun and nostalgic nuance. However the best Body Snatcher movie for me is 1993 version on the military base with Gabrielle Anwar."

I've always liked it a lot, while thinking Don Siegel's 1956 movie a masterpiece. But it's unfair to compare the two. They attack the story from different eras and different directions.\n\nDonald Sutherland leads an interesting cast, including Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, Veronica Cartwright and Jeff Goldblum. And they tell the story very well. Nimoy is relaxed, Sutherland manages to make a public health officer cool, and Goldblum and Cartwright are agreeably cooky. Adams is also very good here, showing vulnerability without being the stereotypical horror movie female.\n\nIt's the story you'll remember, though, and rightly so. Jack Finney's classic tale has stood the test of time, and with the aid of excellent effects, so has the movie. And of course that final scene remarkably manages to match Kevin McCarthy's jolt down the highway in the original. He has a great cameo in this, doing exactly the same thing, and it's fun to spot Robert Duval and Don Siegel himself.\n\nKaufman's direction is highly unusual and highly effective -shooting one scene early on in a hallway while the scene goes on inside a room, steadily tracking in - it actually makes an exposition scene interesting.\n\nGripping, compelling, and yes, very frightening. So rare for a remake to be this good. Perhaps only Carpenter's The Thing has matched it."

Then again, it was made during the 1950s, and a lot of great SF movies were made during that decade (for example, \"The Thing From Another World\", \"Forbidden Planet\", \"Them!\").\n\nA year or so ago, I tried watching the 1978 edition on Turner Classic Movies and I switched it off after less than an hour. I usually give a movie a second chance, just in case my first impression might have been wrong (e. G., \"Jurassic Park\") and I tried again last night when TCM showed it and I lasted a bit longer.\n\nSo what was wrong with it? For one thing, it was extremely boring. Nothing much happened during the time I was watching and it took a while for things to try to get moving.\n\nThe acting also left a lot to be desired. Donald Sutherland was wooden, as I found him to be in many of his earlier movies, and he looked like he had just walked off the set of another one of his films, \"Animal House\". Leonard Nimoy, I'm sorry to say, tried once again to shake his Spock image and failed miserably. (If you don't believe me, watch him in the Yul Brynner flick \"Catlow\".) However, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and attribute it to a lousy script.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing about the other characters was remotely interesting or worthy of my attention. I really didn't care what happened to any of them.\n\nI found this version of IOTBS to be a complete and irritating waste of my time. Fortunately, director Philip Kaufman would go on to redeem himself with movies such as \"The Right Stuff\".\n\nStick with the original, despite its somewhat hokey ending."

        "review_detailed_main": "A remake of the 1958 classic gets a 70s update.\n\nThe premise is the same but the reasons behind it are different. It seems like each incarnation of this film reflects the unrest of each society it was made in.\n\nThis film depicts the 70s swing towards pop-psychology and psychiatry that was popular at the time. The psychiatrist characters played by Leonard Nimoy and Jeff Goldbloom brilliantly convey this angle.\n\nBut the film also shows American society and its people in disarray. Post-Watergate and post- Vietnam politics and the related disillusionment fuel the characters and general feel of this film. No one knows who to trust, what the truth is or who/what to believe in anymore.\n\nParanoia is also a key component in this movie. This makes the film a very intense watch and quite exhausting at times. Whilst I love this film its a movie I have to be in the mood to watch. It seems like tiny nuances and interactions that characters would normally take for granted are given thought time, credence and then magnified. An example is when Brooke Adams character is bumped into. There is then a sequence in which Adams and this character are walking away from each other down a corridor but take turns to look at each other over their shoulders.\n\nThere is also a sequence where Adams is walking around San Francisco and passes a bust city bus. Every single passenger is looking right at her. Is the camera capturing reality or the internal and paranoid thoughts of Ms Adams?\n\nThe paranoia and suspicion escalates until we get to one of the most famous unsettling endings in movie history.\n\nBrilliantly acted, written and directed. This really is a prime slice of time capsule filmmaking then is strangely as relevant today as it was in the 70s. This is also one of the best San Francisco movies ever made. The city looks amazing and provides a gorgeous backdrop to the film's events. Added kudos for the mud baths locale.\n\nLook out for the cameo by Robert Duvall as a priest on a swing and the man-dog that suddenly appears who is a weird fusion of a banjo playing character and his dog earlier in the film."

It is tedious and pretentious. The 1993 version is much better. This version is comparable to the soporific and irrelevant 2007 version.\n\nMost characters are annoying. Donald Sutherland always had an irksome aura. I never liked his films, the rest of the cast, even L. Nimoy are awful in this remake.\n\nTo make things worst, it is worth mentioning that the special effects (they had an advantage of 20 years of technological advances) are sophomoric compared to the original\n\nAll in all this, this is a pretty idiotic film."

The acting and the script. Donald Sutherland is amazing, even if he starts the movie off by observing a rat crap in a pale of soup. Do not let the simplicity of his job as a health inspector fool you, because he has a whole boatload of crap coming his way, as the plot of this film begins to unravel, and he is one of very people few left who is able to recognize what is really happening."

The movie is unpredictable that I didn't even expect to happened and the ending is pretty terrifying. The practical effects are done really well and looks great in the movie. I really like how we see the aliens formed into duplicates and the effects looks great. I also like the effects when the duplicates comes out of the pods and the pods looks great too.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" follows a San Francisco health department worker, his colleague, and their friends who find themselves in the midst of an apparent alien invasion, and with few means of escape.\n\nTo be frank, I tend not to enjoy science fiction all that much, but this 1978 retelling of the Jack Finney novel gets noted praise, so I had faith it would be something good. Long story short, it didn't disappoint. While it is in part a science fiction film, \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" is more of a paranoid survival thriller with shades of bonafide horror. Kaufman's direction is fantastic, and savvy editing techniques give the film a frantic tone at times which helps ramp up the paranoia.\n\nEven more notable I think is the masterful sound design. The ambient noises of San Francisco's city streets often blur together with alien noises and bizarre tones, which also bolsters the sense of paranoia and infiltration of something otherworldly. The performances from all the central cast are solid; Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams make a formidable lead couple, while Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright are both likable and believable as their eccentric hippie friends. Leonard Nimoy also makes an appearance as a a psychiatrist, as does Art Hindle as Adams's invaded boyfriend.\n\nWhile I do feel that the film's final act does somewhat decelerate the masterful sense of paranoia to its own detriment, it is an explosive conclusion that is bookended with a chilling end-note scene that has gone down in the annals of the horror film. All in all, a phenomenally-crafted thriller. 9/10."

Notably, this 1978 remake of this 1956 classic, unfolds with almost ~zero~ soundtrack music to garnish the scenes or the dialogue. Occasionally some orchestral trumpets blare to accompany forthcoming shocks. I won't bore you with a plot synopsis. Who hasn't seen one of the versions of it? It's an iconic grandparent to many sci-fi offspring over the past 3 decades. BTW; just an aside...a young Jeff Goldblum has already begun to carve out his specialty niche in 'Snatchers-2'; e.g; the fast-talking eccentric whose free associating dialogue keeps the film moving at a brisk pace... (yet with no particular goal in mind.) Goldblum has this particular 'shtick' patented...reacting to scenes like they were Rorschach inkblots is a colorful additive. Alba's Real Science Ratings give it an acceptable RSR...i.e; it's realistic except for stretches the \"MacGuffin\" (the body snatching pods.)"

There is no gore, just unrelenting suspense. You never quite know who's possessed by the alien form, you suspect everyone and it's almost unbearable. Nancy Cartwright delivers a great performance -- she looks soooo scared! -- and the ensemble cast is convincing. The same subject has been filmed in 1956, under the same title (it's OK, but the remake is better) and in 1994 under the title Body Snatchers ( almost every good idea is wasted in this one, tough it's entertaining if you haven 't seen the others)."

Well, if there's one thing that can't be beat about the first is the length. At inside of 90 minutes it has no time to spare and is about as rapid paced and tight a scifi thriller as you'll find. This one is a larger movie budget and size wise and slaps on an extra half hour or so. Its doesn't drag but it certainly has its lulls. The eeriness of the paranoia might be a bit heightened and naturally it ends in a 70's fashion and impactful finale. Behind Donald Sutherland is probably the strongest supporting cast of these films which also includes a cameo of Kevin McCarthy which might be one of the movie's best decisions-along with that mandog thing.\n\nAnd Michael Chapman's expressive cinematography is probably the best single aspect."

It changes the setting from a small California town to San Francisco with Donald Sutherland's health inspector who harbors an increasing suspicion of the sudden attitude changes of people. Particularly noticeable sequences include Jeff Goldblum's unfortunate sacrifice to save his friends to Leonard Nimoy's attitude change from a warm doctor to an emotionless drone. Donald Sutherland is excellent in his role as the health inspector with one hell of a supporting cast. Unlike the original, the drones scream when they see a real person. The ending is a true shocker as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) is a health inspector for the city of San Francisco. His colleague Elizabeth (Brooke Adams) has discovered an strange new plant. When Elizabeth noticed that her husband (Art Hindle) doesn't appear as he seems to be. Matthew and Elizabeth has been noticing strange things that starting to happen all over the city. Civizens of the city have been acting strangely and there's always accidents that always seems to happen. Matthew's friends Jack (Jeff Goldblum) and Nancy (Veronica Cartwright) are also noticing odd behavior and they witness something very eerie. What looks to be an attempt replacement of Jack. Only Matthew's other friend, an famous novelist/psychologist Dr. David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy) doesn't believe the story on Matthew's friends or what have Matthew's been experiencing. Elizabeth feels it has something to do with the new species that she discovered but Dr. Kibner, Elizabeth's husband and other citizens of the city are not quite the same people. They are not the same people, we once knew. There's an strange, on-going conspiracy in the city and there's going paranoia between Matthew & his friends. It seems they cannot trust no one, including those are being acting strange and emotionless.\n\nDirected by Philip Kaufman (Henry & June, Rising Sun, Twisted) made an unique, paranoid, suspense, sci-fi/horror film of the late 1970's. This is a semi-sequel of the original 1956 movie of the same name. It also includes an couple of in-jokes for fans of the 1956 picture as well. This intriguing story, which is based on a novel by Jack Finney. Which it's been certainly an classic premise. Which it's been remade twice again in 1993 as \"Body Snatchers\" and 2007 as \"The Invasion\". Sutherland gives an strong performance in this film. But he's surrounded by a good cast like Adams, Goldblum, Cartwright and Nimoy. Which these supporting cast are giving an fine performances as well.\n\nThe latest DVD from MGM/FOX is a two disc set. DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good:Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD also has an interesting commentary track by the director (Which it's been from the previous DVD edition and it's wasn't anamorphic as well). Disc two has an entertaining featurettes but they are disappointingly short. Which all these features from disc two are under one hour! The featurettes from disc two has interviews with the filmmakers, sound designers and actors. The features are good but they could have been much longer and i would love to production stories by Adams, Goldblum and Nimoy but they are not interview sadly. The two disc set also has an fascinating collector's booklet. This horrific paranoia thriller certainly has a lot of attention and it has one of the most bleakest eerie conclusions in movie history. Don't miss this unusual movie. Screenplay by W.D. Richter (Big Trouble in Little China, Needful Things, Stealth). Weird music score by Denny Zeitlin. (****/*****)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) is probably my favorite version of this movie that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline involves an outbreak that initially appears to be plant based but quickly evolves to human based. As observers start seeing more and more humans turn they quickly transition from trying to educate people of the invasion to trying to survive it. This movie is directed by Philip Kaufman (Rising Sun) and stars Donald Sutherland (Animal House), Brooke Adams (The Dead Zone), Leonard Nimoy (Star Trek), Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park) and Veronica Cartwright (Alien). This movie is absolutely outstanding. This cast top to bottom is perfectly selected and everyone plays their part to perfection. The writing and dialogue is brilliant and the way they initiate the invasions and circumstances of the invasion are very well done. The pods and special effects are very good for the time and the ending is the most terrifiying of all the Invasion of the Body Snatcher films. There's nothing missing from this film - acting, writing, dialogue, special effects and conclusion. This is an easy 10/10 that I would strongly recommend and belongs in your collection."

She puts it in a jar of water next to the bed and the next day her boyfriend is acting strange, and emotionless. And this is how it all starts.\n\nShe confides in her friend, Matthew (Donald Sutherland) from the Department of Health. In the meantime, Matthew's friend, Jack (Jeff Goldblum) contacts him when a man dies at a mud parlour, and the body is covered in an unusual substance.\n\nAs it turns out, the alien creatures - or things, or whatever they are - take over a human body, and then clones it and gets rid of the original. The clone is emotionless. I suppose the alien's aim here is to take over (and eliminate) the human race. The human transforms into an emotionless being once they fall asleep after being infected.\n\nIn the 2007 remake called 'The Invasion' it was much clearer when someone was infected. In 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' I wasn't always sure whether someone was infected or not. There were too many inconsistencies. This film was a bit slow. The infected tried to stay awake...and so did I... The camera work was also very strange.\n\nThere's a very subtle romance interest that felt genuine, which I rather enjoyed. The make-up effects with creatures emerging from pods were very well done, and rather creepy.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Yeah, I suppose so, but I do have mixed feelings. Part of me prefers 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', because it was classier. Part of me prefers 'The Invasion' because it was faster paced, with more action."

This thing crawls into your psyche and, again, as I've said before, makes you think about it for a long time. Blatant horrificness (is that a word?\"} ran rampant through the last one, which even sets it apart from its ancestor. There really was a perfect balance between the sublety and blatant \"horrificness.\" The one nudity part seemed to be necessary, if nothing else for a sort of realism.\n\nSan Francisco was a good normal backdrop that almost everybody could identify with, instead of a fictional town. Tat makes it even scarier. The ending differs from the first one, but it does nothing to detract from the story as it exists, 22 years later..."

(I happen to live door-to-door with a cinema that frequently shows classic films like this, and I end up going there a couple of times a week. And mostly end up renting, for a quarter of the price, the bad Hollywood films that plague the European cinemas.)\n\nJust think about what great films the \u00b470s gave us, everything from \u00b4The French Connection\u00b4 to Star Wars\u00b4. Body Snatchers feels like a typical \u00b470s thriller, down- to- earth storytelling with a natural feeling of reality. What\u00b4s so special about this Science fiction classic is that it manages to give an believable portrait of how easy it is for us to turn a blind eye. Even when people change over night, (which they do here thanks to the body snatchers) we hardly bother to wonder why.\n\nIt doesn\u00b4t take a genius to draw parallels to the totalitarian ideologies that plagued the \u00b470s, everything from the Soviet Union to Pinochets Chile. But what\u00b4s so typically \u00b470s, and in turn makes this a great social portrait, is that they didn\u00b4t seem to be obsessed with making films that avoided being scary and uncomfortable. Here you can truly feel the paranoia, Donald Sutherland gives an great performance, and the terror of the characters.\n\nWhat gives this film a slot in my top ten science fiction/thriller is the fantastic ending. Even if your not used to the slow pace and the greyish tones, give it a chance. When you see the last scene you will know what I\u00b4m talking about!"

The two movies are extremely similar, and I was a bit surprised how much of the same ground they cover. This version was just as effective at creating that tone of fear and paranoia, and by the end, a sense of utter desperation and hopelessness. I think the cast does a good job of reacting to all the horror, and also showing the difference between ordinary people and the emotionless pod people. My big issue with this movie is that I felt like I had seen it all before. The original covered all the same ground and managed it in a much more efficient 80 minutes. The only thing this movie added to the conversation was gross-out effects, which I certainly didn't need. I was also a bit annoyed with the clueless behavior of Donald Sutherland as he is constantly trusting Leonard Nimoy for no good reason, and ignoring the fact that he acts totally suspect the entire time. I can certainly see how some people might prefer this version of the story, but the '56 version was more my style of sci-fi horror, and even that one wasn't exactly my cup of tea."

        "review_detailed_main": "I first saw this movie on TV in my early teens and it really caught my eye. Since then I've seen it multiple times and I'm still convinced that it's one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.\n\nBriefly, it's the story of a bunch of people who see the city around them gradually changing, people becoming distant and somehow cold. Paranoia and later panic ensues when they discover that people are being replaced with duplicates who have the same memories but no emotions.\n\nThe acting from Donald Sutherland as Matthew is brilliant (and apparently effortless) and Brooke Adams does a great job as Elizabeth. I love the scene were Matthew is cooking for Elizabeth at his apartment and they end up talking outside - it's played very naturally and subtly shows the affection they have between them. When Elizabeth does 'that funny thing' with her eyes, it's a wonderful moment and gives a perfect respite from the paranoia. The whole scene gives us a peek at how enjoyable life is for the characters and makes us aware of what they have to lose. It's easy to like these characters.\n\nVeronica Cartwright as Nancy exudes a sense of foreboding mixed with panic as only she can - on this performance it's easy to see why she ended up playing Lambert in 'Alien.' The terror in her face is amazing and totally convincing.\n\nJeff Goldblum puts in a fine turn as Jack - suitably creepy, quirky and funny all at once. He seems to have continued this in other movies but has never bettered this role so far in his career.\n\nLeonard Nimoy fits perfectly as the patronizing shrink Dr Kibner - he clearly found playing a logical analyst very familiar. Interestingly, on the DVD Director's commentary, Kaufman says that this was an attempt by Nimoy to break away from his type casting as Spock. He could have fooled me - this is just the Vulcan all over again but with a hint of malevolence. That's not to say he doesn't do a good job - he does everything right.\n\nOverall - a superb job by the entire cast.\n\nThe film is shot to accentuate the feelings of paranoia and dread. Lots of hand held camera shots, offset angles and long takes add up to an organic feeling, like you're floating around the characters. When they're in the car, you're in the back seat. When they're all together in one room, you're moving amongst them. There's lots of opaque glass, plastic and mirrors in shot - characters are often seen behind them and obscured so only an outline or a shadow is visible. It all adds to the strange feeling. The lighting is amazing with the great use of shadows and colours - check out the use of blue and green in lots of different scenes. A lot is lit from below or from a strange angle.\n\nThe special effects are pretty good but are kept to a minimum - this isn't a flashy movie - it's about suspense and the feeling of hopelessness, not action sequences.\n\nThe sound track is just as off beat as the rest of the movie. It's minimal but there at the right moments, often consisting of pulsating noises or strange keyboard melodies. It fits just right and id one of the best things about this movie.\n\nThe ending is fantastic. If you haven't seen it, don't read anymore reviews of the movie as if it's spoilt you'll regret it. Suffice it to say that it's one of the bravest and mind blowing endings ever.\n\nI can hardly fault this film - perhaps there's a few action scenes towards the end that slightly disrupted the menacing feeling, but overall it's a true classic of it's genre. A must see."

That's the main difference between this and the original 50's version. You can watch this movie and think to yourself \"This could really happen\". I would have to say this version is slightly better than the 50's one. The 1994 version showed no love to the story - it was horrible!

This lavish remake of the low-budget 1956 classic has elaborate special effects showing how the cloning occurs. However, given how slow and inefficient the cloning process is, it is hard to believe that the entire population of a city is cloned within a couple of days. McCarthy and Siegel, star and director of the original, make cameo appearances and serving as reminder that this version falls far short of the original. Whereas the Siegel film had a spooky atmosphere, this one is all about special effects. Kaufman employs an odd visual style that is rather distracting."

        "review_detailed_main": "The 1978 re-imagining of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is a classic in its own right. It's a brilliant example of how Hollywood could, on occasion during the Cold War, portray and reflect on the fears and anxieties of the American consciousness. The invaders could've been aliens or creatures from another realm; it didn't really matter. The force that takes over personifies America's fear of invasion from an intelligent and unrelenting hostile force. The aliens themselves could almost be an allegory for an enemy that America didn't really understand and therefore feared, namely, the Soviet regime. Throughout the film there are many scenes which give a clear indication of the deeply-set paranoia which was prevalent at the time.\n\nThe score composed for this movie is excellent at conveying the fears, anxieties and paranoia of the characters. There are moments where the music almost becomes alien itself; an innovative use of synthesizers screeches erratically, changing pitch and speed according to the level of anxiety on-screen. It's especially poignant during the scenes which show the Invaders 'snatching' people.. The acting is, by most, excellent. There are a few scenes which are a little 'hammy' by our standards today, but for the most part Sutherland, Goldblum et al, do a fantastic job at conveying their frustration, anxiety and terror when they begin to realise the sheer magnitude of what's happening to the world around them. The cinematography is very well done with regards to the frenetic chase sequences, and frenzied emotionally-driven conversations. The most impressive and memorable sequences are the scenes involving the 'body snatchers'. The only film I can compare the alien visuals to is perhaps the 1982 remake of 'The Thing', where puppetry and cosmetics are unseen; only other-worldly and horrifying visuals prevail on-screen. Overall I'd say that this film is an excellent reflection of Cold War anxiety, and it translates the somewhat convoluted and laughably over-the-top plot of the original movie, into a movie which provokes fear and contemplation.\n\nThe 1978 re-imagining of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is a must-see for anyone who enjoys intelligent, tense and thought-provoking thrillers."

The pacing, the story, the acting, the music score, the direction, are all perfect.\n\nComparing it with the 1956 original - the unfortunate producer's cut (the intro and outro were added later and destroyed half of the film's impact) - this one's clearly better.\n\nI would like to emphasize Leonard Nimoy's appearance as the psychiatrist. In this role it is being proven what a talented actor Nimoy is and that he is worth a lot more recognition as an artist. His performance makes the movie more credible, as he gives a pragmatic dimension to the movie.\n\nRecommended viewing conditions: Alone, very late at night.\n\n10/10"

The original has a man going out of his mind; this later version resorts to the cliche of an hysterical woman.\n\n2. While the use of music and sound is far ahead of its predecessor, often it's just way too much.\n\n3. The whole film depicts women as weak, unstable, illogical.

The ending is cheap, hasty, and leaves me asking \"Why?!\" Poor workmanship there.\n\nActing: Most do a fine job, but I'm sick of seeing Leonard Nimoy as the ever-wise alpha intellectual. And it's absolutely stupid for Robert Duvall to have a cameo appearance as a useless priest (for which he was not paid).\n\nThis is not a bad movie, but it's a frustrating, run-of-the-mill 1970's \"hysterorama.\"\n\nI would not watch again."

Upon arrival they take the form of a new or foreign flower, possibly a grex (a hybrid of orchids based solely on their parentage). These \"flowers\" were nothing less than the invading hosts that would take the form of any nearby person and actually become him/her minus things like emotions.\n\n\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" is a remake of the 1956 movie of the same title. I think the 1978 version is better. Matthew (Donald Sutherland), Elizabeth (Brooke Adams), Jack (Jeff Goldblum), and Nancy (Veronica Cartwright) all find themselves in a near hopeless situation. They are fully aware that people's bodies are being taken over, yet they are powerless to stop it.\n\nThe fear, the stress, the anxiety of such a situation is unimaginable. Honestly, I think I'd just give up. I know that the fight or flight inclination in me would kick in to preserve my life but what if everyone I know and love is now this emotionless being? What world would I be fighting to remain in? The only way I see survival as possible from a psychological standpoint would be like a \"The Walking Dead\" type scenario where I have a few loved ones and we find a community to join. Other than that, my desire to keep on fighting to live would probably wane each day until I gave in.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the transformation takes place if you sleep near one of these alien flowers. So, there's yet another defense mechanism I'd have to learn: sweep my sleeping area for alien flowers so that I can rest.\n\nIt's all so dire."

Now it surprised me that this was a remake because it was extremely good, and remakes rarely are. Not since John Carpenters \"the Thing\" have I've seen such a good remake. The story is well written and the acting is great. Most of the credit should go to Donald Sutherland of course. Also we have Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright as the rest of the escapees. Also it was nice to finally see Leonard Nimoy doing something else than Spock from Star Trek. This movie definitely has him in a very different role.\n\nNow this is one of the reviews where I'm not going to bother to spoil anything by writing a synopsis. i think the IMDb synopsis speaks for itself. Plus, this is simply a must see film, please don't spoil anything for yourself. I had seen the ending before, ruined the fun a bit, but I feel that I still gave it a fear rating.\n\nThe only negative parts of this film were, that it can be a little slow and repetitive. You can only run and hide for so long and keep it interesting. But still they always stopped it right before it got bad, and that saved the movie.\n\nI loved this movie. It was scary, suspenseful and damn right chilly. Good effects for it time, maybe a little dated but most people would hardly notice. I really can't say anything but, \"watch it\". If you're a Sci-Fi, thriller, horror or even a fan of Donald Sutherland, this is a must see movie. I give this movie a 9/10."

Alien seed comes to earth and start to grow, as they grow they also begin to replicate the town's people's bodies. The story is unfinished. It lacks closure, but maybe people don't need it. I do. I get where the story was going, but there are too many questions unanswered and I need a part 2 because I need that closure in a film. And because of that, I don't want to give it a bunch of stars.

Brooke Adams,(Elizabeth Driscoll),\"Gas Food Lodging\", is a good friend of Matthew and they encounter strange things happening to their husbands and wives and even a Chinese Laundry Owner. Jeff Goldblum,(Jack Bellicec) \"Incident at Lock Ness\" gave a great supporting role in trying to help Matthew Bennell find out just what was going on with the people of San Francisco. There is great photography around the City of San Francisco, especially the Victorian homes (Alamo Section) inside and out and plenty of trolley cars going up and down the steep hills. There is even some nudity with a certain girl running around topless because of some brain damage. Enjoy"

They're poor substitutes for the original which may have worked because of some odd quirk in casting, direction or subject matter and/or timing of release. That certainly would seem the case with the original \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\". Released in 1956 during the hellish days of rabid anti communism, its story was said to be a metaphor about the perils of socialism and its dehumanizing effects. Whatever. The 1978 remake takes the basic premise and makes the material very much its own. There's just enough homage paying to the original (such as Kevin McCarthy's brief but effective cameo) so the film makers don't seem like they're unaware of or belittling (disrespecting) the source material. But they're not making a carbon copy either. The mood is entirely its own and it is creepy as hell. What's so good about it? The cast (especially Brooke Adams and Sutherland), Kaufman's understated but controlled direction and the films pacing which gets right into the story straight away. But the film's dire mood is what makes it so effective: you feel just as panicky as Adams does at the bookstore when Sutherland takes her to see Leonard Nimoy's Dr. David Kibner. You don't want what she's feeling and sensing to be true but it is and as the tension and suspense escalates, the film turns from a paranoid thriller to a horror movie.\n\nThis has been one of my favorite films for years and just seeing it again recently on MGM/HD (in pristine condition) made me realize how good it was."

        "review_detailed_main": "I thought that it would suck if you fell asleep only if Fred Krueger haunted you, now there is a whole new reason to drink plenty of coffee.\n\nINVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is a creepy film that should have spawned plenty of sequels, if not at least one more. I can tell you that this film is very well done but it is also frustrating. This is such a huge subject and the film does a superlative job in exploring much of that topic. It also seems to give us just enough to keep us interested. As I was watching the movie, I said to my fiancee that there is enough material in here to make another film, and that was before I knew how the film ended. And then when that last shot stares you in the face, and the credits role, I was creeped out, felt icky ( two incredibly juvenile terms but nonetheless appropriate in this instance ) and left completely unsatisfied. I can't believe that this film has been around for 22 years and no one has taken it on. And given the fact that Philip Kaufman is the director here, couldn't he had at least some opportunity for a sequel? After 1981 he must have been at one of the high points of his career as he penned the script for RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Perhaps he could have taken the script to Steven or George and they could have helped develop it. All I know is that there are very few sequels that aren't just a rehash of the first film. But this one could have been a true sequel. The next one could have started off right from the very last shot of the first. Dammit! I want to know more. I want to know where they came from, how they clone you while you sleep, and how come when some people got cloned when there didn't seem to be any pods around. There are so many questions that have answers to them. There has to be an intelligent script out there that is just collecting dust somewhere.\n\nOkay, I feel better now that issue is off my chest. As for the film itself, it is not really scary. It is incredibly creepy and it is very well done. Where as most horror films of this era are incredibly parsimonious with their budget, you can see that there was a substantial amount of money put into this one. The special effects are wonderful and the tension that builds is excellent. I like the fact that this also doesn't take long to get into the crux of the story. In the first ten minutes you can feel a sense of paranoia. We feel just as Liz does. We know there is something wrong, but just not what it is. We know the flower has something to do with it, but not sure exactly what. The film takes great pains to unravel the mystery like an onion. It has many layers to it and each one is peeled back with painstaking precision. But again, this brings me back to my original point, I want to know more, aaaahhh!!!\n\nI am 28 years old and I have seen tons of films. That may not seem old to many people but for my age I have seen a great many horror films( mostly from the 70's and on) and films in general. I believe that horror today can not compete with horror of yesterday ( there are exceptions, of course ). It is films like this that prove that point. While not scary the way HALLOWEEN is, it is intense and creepy. You feel weird after watching this film. And believe it or not, it will stay with you for a while. I was not terrified to go to sleep but it did stay with me during my slumber and I had a nightmare. In it, Leatherface was chasing me, and if I fell asleep, not only could he get me, if I alluded him then the Body Snatcher people would get me. Now that is a cool nightmare. I tossed and turned a few times and woke up in a cold sweat. But here is the capper. I wanted to go back to sleep so I could get back into that dream. How many movies from today can you think of that can do that to you? BLAIR WITCH, maybe SIXTH SENSE? Not many that's is for certain.\n\n8 out of 10 A great flick, but where is my sequel? Dammit!\n\nOne of the coolest last shots of a film. Who thought Donald Sutherland could be so creepy?"

The color of the 1978 film vs. the black & white of the 1956 film makes very little difference. To me, the cast of the newer version does make a difference. Five strong performances by Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, Jeff Goldblum, and Veronica Cartwright outweigh the excellent acting of Kevin McCarthy, Dana Wynter, and Larry Gates. I can recommend both films. The Miller-Movies formula awards this film a solid 9, and the 1956 film a high 8."

Many actors in the movie were awesome and there was one character that i loved the most and that was a beautiful girl named Nancy, i wont tell you what she will do in the movie but I can say that she was probably the smartest of them but she did make a mistake, you will understand what I mean after you watched the whole film. I usually don't watch scary movies but this one took the cake and i really recommend it."

Today, I finally saw it and it is really a good movie for horror and science fiction. Brook Adams better known as Tony Shaloub's wife is terrific in her role and reminds me of Linda Fiorentino in some respects. Donald Sutherland plays Matthew Bennell. Brook's Elizabeth confides that her husband Jeffrey is acting strange. So other spouses are discovering their partners have changed overnight. The film is set and filmed in San Francisco. The supporting cast members include the under-rated Veronica Cartwright and Jeff Goldblum and also Leonard Nimony as well as Art Hindle as Jeffrey. The film is faithful to the original movie but there are minor changes and this version allows us to see how the transformation happens."

        "review_detailed_main": "No, I'm not calling this movie a turd. It's actually a great movie, particularly for a remake. But the turd/caper scene, which occurs very early in the film, is one that stuck with me as a kid. For one thing I had no idea what a caper was. For another, every time my family went to a restaurant I worried there were rat droppings in my food. Anyway, back to the review. This is the first (and best) remake of the 1956 sci-fi classic of the same name. The plot, if you've been living under a rock, is that aliens are quietly replacing people with duplicates. The script is solid and Philip Kaufman's direction is excellent. Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, and Jeff Goldblum are all good. Veronica Cartwright steals pretty much every scene she's in. This is touted by some as being better than the original. I don't think that's the case but it is a great film that wisely avoids being a scene-for-scene remake (I hate those). It feels like much more of a horror movie (although the original was certainly scary for its time). Definitely recommended, whether you've seen the original or not."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a solid remake, about on par with the original, as it does some things better but other things worse. The story really isn't changed at all, just updated to the '70s in San Francisco, and that kind of hurts it, because anyone who's seen the original knows exactly what's going to happen. That is, up until the twist, which is really terrific and suits the film perfectly; it's quite dark, something that the original sorely needed (and almost had, if the director had had his way). The direction is quite good with some impressive cinematography, and there are some truly scary moments, but the acting is okay at best and the characters aren't developed at all. It does a nice job of updating the paranoia of the first one, but doesn't do enough to distance itself from the original."

Donald Sutherland helps by providing a great performance and ensuring that it is he we follow here. We believe he is intelligent, honest and on the ball. This will have devastating consequences eventually but for the meantime he is our man and Brooke Adams is ideal at his side and seemingly against a greater and greater percentage of the population. Jeff Goldblum and Leonard Nimoy play a pair of oddballs (what else?) and distract us somewhat as things get very bad. In the end there is something of a lack of involvement/suspense because we find it hard to believe there is any possible way out but for the most part this is a fine ride with plenty of sociopolitical asides to keep everyone happy."

As suspenseful and as paranoid as its predecessor, the 1978 remake of \"Invasion of the B.S.\" is a tasty and worthy contribution to the horror genre, even while it's talking about rat turds. Donald Sutherland, fresh from his ass-shot in National Lampoon's Animal House, plays Dr. Binnell this time, who is now a health inspector for the F.D.A.. He did his own stunts and was hit by a Volkswagen beetle while filming, which is a great movie in itself. Kevin McCarthy, from the original, makes one of the cleverest cameos of all time. There's a crazy hobo who sings and his head ends up on his dog. Brooke Adams looks like a sexier Karen Carpenter who both brushed her teeth and finished a sandwich. Plus creepiest of all - look for that priest on the swing - its freaking Robert Duvall! Also of note, our favorite Vulcan shows up (Leonard Nimoy) and plays a real prick. Plus Jeff Goldblum sticks some Kleenex up his beak. That final scream will make the hairs on your neck stand up. Plus no commies this round! Don't fall asleep! 9 out of 10. A-. Classic horror movie.\n\nGrade: \"Shvitz\""
