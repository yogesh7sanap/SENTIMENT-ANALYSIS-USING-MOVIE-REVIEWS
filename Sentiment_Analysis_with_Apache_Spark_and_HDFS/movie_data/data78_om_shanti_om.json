        "review_detailed_main": "Bring out the popcorn, grab a cola and get ready for 2 and a half hours of laughs, songs, color, emotions, and spoofs. If you're a fan of the Indian film industry and have kept up with the news, Om Shanti Om is for you. If you love entertainment to the max, OSO is definitely for you! Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om spares nobody, not even its makers when it comes to poking fun. OSO is a film about films, it's a film in a film and above all, it's made to celebrate the biggest film producing industry - The Indian Film Industry.\n\nOm Prakash is a junior artist who thrives to become a lead hero one day. He is a horrible actor and has a mother who hams more than him. Om has another dream: To win over a star, Shanti-Priya. One circumstance leads to another which leads to Om being a witness to the death of Shanti by producer Mukesh Mehra. Om also gets killed in the incident. That same night, Om is reborn as Om Kapoor. Will Om realize his past-life? Will he avenge Shanti's death? As the tagline suggests: For some dreams, one life-time is not enough.\n\nOSO has a done-to-death story. But that's not the point. The film is a parody of films and the ones working in it. Notice the spoofs on the yesteryear stars such as Manoj Kumar. A controversial scene but one can't deny it's hilarious. Not to forget spoofs on Govinda, Keshtu Mukherjee, and Suraj Bharjateeyaa. Of course the most memorable comic scene has to be SRK pretending to be a south Indian actor. \"Mind It\" OSO's first half is gripping and keeps the viewer alert. The drama folds the right way. The second half loses steam at times. It's not bad, but unlike Farah's first film where the second half competed well with the first, it stars to slow down a bit. It picks back up, fortunately.\n\nThe spoofs aren't less hilarious in the second half. The film pokes fun of a lot of celebs and Indian film industry issues. To start, SRK being late is a spoof on himself being late to sets in real life. Not to forget the whole dard-e-disco song is a spoof on item numbers. The high point of the second half has to be the award ceremony. The spoof on Abhishek Bachchan is subtle yet funny. SRK doing the same roles and being nominated is remarkably funny. Not to forget Akshay KUmar's outburst at the awards is aplaudworthy and rib-tickling. Subash Ghai-Rishi Kapoor spoof is funny too.\n\nFlaws? As mentioned, the second half falters in some parts. Also, SRK remembering his past so quickly seems rushed and unconvincing.\n\nThe climax, however, is a pleasant surprise.\n\nSpecial Mention - The Deewangee song is a treat to the eyes. 31 stars in one song is no joke and they all look nothing short of spectacular. Special mention to the ones that caught my eye with their appearance. Dharmendra, Jatendra, Kajol, Salman, Saif, Sanju, Rekha etc all do well alongside Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nFarah Khan and her team of writers have put some genius into parts of the movie. The writing is witty, smart, and quite innovative. Dilague is first rate.\n\nVishal-Shekar's music is amazing. With a variety of songs in one film, they do a wonderful job.\n\nFarah's direction is first rate. She handles all the moments with ease. It's not a better film than Main Hoon Na, but still a good job.\n\nIn 2007, 3 months before OSO released; SRK unleashed the actor in him and kept the star away in a movie called Chak De India. In OSO, it's the opposite. OSO is a film where SRK can chill and not worry about the criticism. His performance is explosive and energetic. In this, it's SRK the superstar unleashed. And kudos to him for also poking fun at himself despite being the producer of this one.\n\nDeepika makes a grand debut and I'm sure she couldn't have asked for anything else. She looks gorgeous and makes a good debut. Arjun Rampal is spectacular as the villain here. Brilliant.\n\nThe supporting cast does well too which includes the lovable Shreyas Talpade, the scene-stealing Kirron Kher and Javed Sheikh.\n\nOverall, A grand film which has one objective - Entertainment!"

This movie was a romp -- overdone theatrics, over-the-top musical numbers, and lots of wink-wink-nudge-nudge allusions. Actually, I probably missed most of those -- but I got enough of them to keep smiling all the way through. Nicely plotted, plenty of really good catch-lines, and warm-hearted at the core. I especially like the end credits, where crew members and the usually faceless support people did a kind of 'red carpet' appearance, to the applause and cheers of the mob. Great bit at the very end, where the director/writer got out of the tuk-tuk for her moment, and everybody was .... well, no spoilers here. Just watch the film. Well worth your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reincanation, Hindi cinema, love, betrayal are some of the themes Farah Khan's delightful and crazy comedy Om Shanti Om deals with. But frankly, it never really matters. This film is simply one of the most entertaining films made in recent times. A spoof of Hindi cinema of past and recent times, the film both pokes fun at it and celebrates its unique, inimitable style. As the story progresses the movie becomes even more alluring. It is at times a drama, at times a thriller, but generally it is just a musical comedy which is not to be taken seriously.\n\nTechnically the film is very impressive. Farah Khan's direction is very good. The film is extremely colourful, with great costumes and fantastic, glossy sets. The 1970s settings are particularly authentic and visibly well-invested. One more aspect which helps to recreate the magic and the atmosphere of the 1970s is the wonderful soundtrack. \"Dhoom Taana\" for instance seems to have been rightly taken from a film of those times.\n\nThe film contains numerous sequences which will have you floored. The Filmfare Award ceremony is one of the funniest sequences in the film. The red carpet scene with celebrities predicting the winners was very funny. The next scene which includes the ceremony and the Best Actor nominations clip was absolutely hilarious. I could not stop laughing as every nominee was unfolded, and Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Kumar's reactions when they lost were awesome.\n\nThe following sequence was the after-party which was another memorable scene. The famous \"Deewangee Deewangee\" song which has some of the best-known actors in India dancing to its tunes, from Dharmendra, Mithun Chakraborty, Rekha and Shabana Azmi to Salman, Saif, Juhi, Urmila, Tabu, Kajol, Rani and Preity, was very exciting and a pleasure to watch. It was truly a moment of unity and celebration for Hindi cinema.\n\nAs far as acting goes, Om Shanti Om is a winner. Every actor understands the film's mood and acts accordingly. Shahrukh Khan is great as the Oms. He's simple as the first Om, cool as the second Om, and overall is as witty and funny as always. Deepika Padukone makes a confident debut. She is very beautiful and likable. Kirron Kher shines in another comic role as the loud mom. Shreyas Talpade delivers a noteworthy performance as Om's best friend and holds his own despite a smaller role. Arjun Rampal plays the typical villain with style.\n\nWell, to sum it up, Om Shanti Om is an extremely enjoyable flick which should provide a great watch for the entire family. Like Farah Khan's previous offering with Shahrukh Khan, Main Hoon Na, this film has a genuine sense of fun. It is the quintessence of Bollywood's uniqueness which makes us realise why and how much we love this film industry. Remember not to expect anything serious or life-turning, and you will not be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you sit to watch a typical Bollywood Commercial masala movie, Leave your brains behind. Om Shanti Om is one such film that entertains you in every aspect.\n\nOm Shanti Om is the story of the Indian Film World. It is the story of a Junior Artist (Extra) Om Prakash Makhija (Shah Rukh Khan) who dreams to become a superstar one day. He is madly in love with Shanti Priya (Deepika Podukone) who is a super star and she is in love with a film producer Mukesh Ahuja (Arjun Rampal). Mukesh after learning this fact that Shanti is pregnant with his child and his most ambitious project will come to hold if he marries her, He kills her. This whole event is witnessed by Shanti's good friend and her secret lover Om. Even Om dies in that tragic accident while trying to save Shanti. Mukesh runs to Hollywood and get's married there a multi-millionaire's daughter.\n\nBut destiny has a total different story to tell\u0085 Om is reborn again after 30 years as a Super Star Om Kapoor (Shah Rukh Khan) and the destiny makes om meets Sandy (Deepika Podukone) who is a look alike of Shanti Priya. Om and Sandy make a plan to trap Mukesh who comes back to India after 30 years to make a film with Om. The evil get's punished and the truth wins forms the rest of the film.\n\nTechnically the film is just brilliant. It shows on the screen the amount of money that has been spent into the making. The sets are glossy and breath taking. The camera work is just superb. The editing is fantastic and crispy. Musically a very decent and a good effort. Especially the song where all the 31 stars perform is a treat to watch for. The story and direction by Farah Khan is very good.\n\nPerformance wise the film belongs to King Khan Shah Rukh Khan all the way. New girl Deepika Podukone is the next superstar. It did not seem at all that she is a new actress and this is her First Film. Arjun Rampal was awesome in the negative role. Kirron Kher was really good once again. Shreyas Talpade was again very good. He gets an equal footage with Shah Rukh to perform.\n\nFor those who go for Artistic Cinema, This film is strictly not for them. But those who need Full Time Pass, Om Shanti Om is the real good choice. Here the Film Maker is trying to fool you, But in return they are offering you a Glossy Dream of 2 hours. So if you are looking for a Roller Coaster ride of Entertainment, Go for Om Shanti Om!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Om Shanti Om\" is an excellent film. However, it's also one that your enjoyment of it may depend on how familiar you are with Bollywood movies. If you haven't seen any or perhaps only one or two, it might be far less interesting for the intermediate and advanced fans of Indian cinema. As for me, I am definitely an intermediate and would actually loved to have had a big-time Indian movie fan watch it with me, as I only recognized some of the huge Indian movie stars that appeared in the film in the star-studded middle.\n\nThe film begins in the 1970s. Om (Shah Rukh Khan) is a struggling actor--a bit player. He's smitten with a leading lady but she seems way out of his reach. Later, however, there is a fire on set and he saves her life--and definitely gets her attention. But, fires seem to come in twos in this film and a bit later, her evil secret husband murders her--and Om is killed as well!\n\nAt this point, something VERY Indian occurs. Just as Om dies in the hospital, in an adjoining room, a baby is born--and the baby turns out to be the reincarnation of Om. The baby's name...Om!! This Om grows up to become a HUGE Indian mega-star and his life is good.\n\nFollowing a portion of the film at an Indian movie award ceremony (by far the best part of the film--and hilarious as well), Om starts to have memories of his previous incarnation. He slowly comes to realize what happened to Om #1 and decides to concoct a complicated plan to trap the murderer by re-staging the murder that happened 30 years ago! However, the plan ends up going askew...just how, you'll have to see for yourself.\n\nThe film is a delight but a strange one. It's like there are three different movies all spliced together. The first and third portions are very serious and the musical numbers are wonderful. As for the second, it is completely different in tone. Om #2 is a mega-star-- and a hilariously self-absorbed one. And, to make it much funnier, lots of very famous Indian mega-stars appear as themselves...sort of. You just have to see this to know what I am talking about but it is something Indian film fans will love--as if they have a back stage pass to REALLY meet the stars as they supposedly really are! Wonderful--and by far the best part of the film.\n\nOverall, despite having a few clich\u00e9s (ones you EXPECT in Bollywood films---such as an ever-present fan to make the stars' hair blow in the wind), the film is one of the most enjoyable and fun Indian pictures you can find. Well worth seeing for fans of the genre.\n\nBy the way, after the picture ends, do NOT turn off the movie. In a really neat twist, not only the stars walk past the camera but just about EVERYONE involved with the film gets their moment on the runway--even the grips and choreographers!"

Baz Lurhman was going for the same kind of thing with 'Moulin Rouge' and - despite hyper-active trickery and bombast - managed to express romance, art and music pretty well, though not as well as is done here.\n\n'Om Shanti Om' manages to combine drama, high emotion, nostalgia, fantasy, romance and self-referential humor to perfection.\n\nSimply told, this is a film about fans. What it is to love an idol on the big screen and the unbreakable fantasy of stepping up onto the big screen. This is also a metaphor for love and the film is also, suitably, wildly romantic.\n\nAnyone who truly loves cinema intelligently will adore this film. Shah Rukh Khan is on his own today, with perhaps Denzel Washington, as a leading man with infinite appeal and effortless charm, intelligence, humor and presence; a movie star at home with the all-time greats.\n\nDeepika Padukone is both a stunning beauty and a complete actress, incredibly, managing to match her brilliant co-star in comedic and dramatic range.\n\nFarah Khan is a director of extraordinary technical and artistic skill and the vision she exerts in Om Shanti Om is breath-taking.\n\nLeave your preconceptions about Bollywood aside and embrace a true classic."

I recommend people to watch this film, mainly because its a shahrukh film, the only downside is the second half, the story is not good, i feel u'll understand watching the film. The story could of had a better ending, however i feel the entertainment value is very high, drawn to the fact that there is almost every star in bollywood in the film. good film 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This review is coming more than a month from the release of this movie. But, how does it matter when Deepika Padukone is still fresh in memory with her Ajab si adaayen. Honestly, I went to the movie to watch her. Long ago, I had predicted that this babe would make a big entry into films. Well, a debut with SRK! How bigger can it get?\n\nThis Deepawali had two major releases, King Khan and Farah Khan\u2019s OSO and Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s Saawariya. Most newspapers drew comparisons between these movies, some on story, on the d\u00e9butante lead actresses, track record of directors, songs, so on and so forth coupled with aggressive marketing campaigns.\n\nOSO starts with the story of a junior artiste Om Makhija in the 70s deeply in love with screen sensation Shantipriya. Both become friends after Om saves Shanti from a fire accident on the sets. Both die in exceptional circumstances and Om is reborn again, this time as superstar Om Kapoor 30 years later. Om realizes his past and sets out for villain Mukesh Mehra in his quest to uncover the secret of his past lover\u2019s demise.\n\nTill the interval, Farah Khan did a great job on recreating 70s cinema. Two comic sequences, one on Manoj Kumar and the other on a mock Tamil film shoot are hilarious. While being a parody on the movie industry of those days, in many ways, OSO pays tribute to many cinematic moments, such as those of rebirth with the Om sign, group dance sequences, bell bottom pants, etc. The best stuff stops here.\n\nThe second segment dwells too much on SRK\u2019s stardom and the story somehow loses focus. Deepika\u2019s role is too limited. But here, villain Arjun Rampal as steals the show. The best of the comic sequences is the Award ceremony with many star cameos. The clips of nominees that is shown there is worth the watch. The end too is very filmy. End credits follow Farash\u2019s style in her first films to show her entire crew. That was sweet.\n\nNon-SRK fans may not really like any praise that I say here. But, one must admit that this great guy has amazing star power, all acquired on his own! There is no dull moment in OSO. Ah, and what do I say of Deepika, she\u2019s just awesome! Arjun Rampal, Shreyas Talpade and Kirron Kher have done great. The music too is captivating. If you haven\u2019t seen this movie, I would say it is worth it for its entertainment value."

Even if you try to shut your brain off and enjoy the movie, the rudimentary consciousness of the brain stem screams at the banalities. Shahrukh was at his overacting best, Deepika had no clue and Arjun Rampal was deader than a dead pan. Shreyas and Kiron Kher are impressive.

The first half of the movie uses some interesting special effects, characterization of stars from that era, and also some very subtle references to stars and film-makers to depict that decade. The cameos of prominent stars throughout the movie adds to the fun factor of the movie.\n\nThe movie offers light-hearted entertainment, several enjoyable songs, and some good performances; especially from Shahrukh Khan and the d\u00e9butante Deepika. Although the movie plot and several key segments are something you have seen before in other movies, OSO's format is irreverent, goofy and enjoyable.

Farah Khan in her second movie kept her promise of giving lot of entertainment, at the same time giving the most senseless and stupid movie. Good or bad I don't know. I will give it to individual to decide.\n\nThat is the reason why the movie is having extreme comments. On one side, its is the best for SRK fans (SRK is there in almost every frame of the movie, so much that finally someone may want to throw out). It is also the best for the mass who like to watch comedy, drama, romance, music in one shot. This movie has it all. \"Maa Ka Pyar\", \"Main Maa Bananewali Hoon\", \"Mera Beta Wapas Aayega\", \"Muze Zinda Gaad Diya\" all and many more emotions are packed in this 3 hr movie. But even after that you feel movie is still lengthy specially in second half.\n\nAs a really good entertainer the movie gives very good music, dance, dialogs. Acting wise all are good except Deepika, specially in second half. No doubt, why she has so less dialogs.\n\nAt the other side the movie is totally unrealistic. Unrealistic characters, unrealistic events, too stupid dialogs. All these points suddenly become clear when you watch 'chak de India' and this movie having less interval in between. I always believe that a movie should be entertaining first, should be able to bind the people to the chair. This movie does that. But then at the times, you also think why the hell have I wasted so much precious time of my life watching this movie.\n\nYou can easily see from what I have written that how much confused I am. I am still not able to decide whether the movie is good or bad. Hence I gave an intermediate rating. Let each individual decide it. Meanwhile I will try to forget that I wasted three hours of life, while watching Dard-e-disco on youtube again and again."

Having just seen the heart rending Khuda Ke Liye, OSO was a reminder that life can be fun, filled with colour, love and laughter- and that even if you don't believe in punar janam, Bollywood movies thrive on the topic.\n\nSRK shows why he is the Shahenshah of bollywood, and ALL his friends show up-- there were more cameos in this movie than I could have expected.\n\nOne must give credit to the stars who laughed at themselves with such good humour......even those who are supposedly currently at outs with SRK.\n\nLive, Love, Laugh!! at this movie, and remember when not every movie had to have a message."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rushed out to see this when I heard it would be showing in Pittsburgh on opening day (a rarity in our city for Hindi films these days, unfortunately)....and I can't say I was disappointed.\n\nThe film draws its storyline from both \"Kaho Naa....Pyaar Hai\" and \"Madumati\" and features exquisite art direction and cinematography, with Shah Rukh Khan playing both himself and a Hrithik Roshan-style character and Deepika Padukone reviving (pardon the pun) Vyjayanthimala's role in the Roy/Ghatak classic. All of the actors do a fine job, and SRK has some very funny moments in the film (particularly in the first half). The mise-en-scene of the studio-within-the-movie scenes was reminiscent of Guru Dutt's \"Kagaaz Ke Phool,\" and the visual design by director Farah Khan and cinematographer V. Manikandan is exquisite and richly detailed. The pacing isn't quite as tight as in FK's directorial debut \"Main Hoon Na,\" but seems to fit the narrative.\n\nOSO is also loaded with all sorts of \"inside\" references to Hindi (and American) films, past and present, which made this a most enjoyable viewing experience. The \"Filmfare award\" scene and song \"Deewangi Deewangi,\" coming right after the interval, were a blast -- I'll need to see the movie again to catch all of the Hindi stars crammed into those fifteen minutes (the scene also gains a few additional laughs by lampooning the recent stage musical \"Bombay Dreams\"). As was done for the cover design of the Beatles'\"Sgt. Pepper\" album, someone ought to run a contest to see who can identify everyone in these two scenes! Vishal and Shekhar's soundtrack is very fresh; they do an excellent job hinting at various Indo-pop musical styles from the 60s and 70s. I only wish that the opening title version of \"Om Shanti Om\" would have been included on the CD as well....will just have to wait for the DVD release, I guess.\n\nNow time to head out and see SLB's \"Saawariya,\" which also seems to be playing in Pittsburgh on opening night. The world is definitely changing!"

He is her biggest fan. He is in love with her. Om dreams of being a superstar, but an incident changes his life forever. Om dies in a mishap, but is reborn into the present day. He attempts to discover the mystery of his demise\u0085\n\nWhat I liked about the film? Well, almost everything (Yes, I admit, I've sold my soul to SRK)! Which is 98.35 per cent of the film! The film is more a take off on the re-birth formula, than a tribute; but it does brilliantly. Farah Khan has made everyone act superbly (yes, including Arjun Rampal!). There are so many things to watch out for so I will just list a few highlights:\n\nThe cameos by almost the entire industry. The fantastic one-liners from '70s Bollywood; The comedy scenes throughout the movie! the digital effects ala Forrest Gump. Deepika Padukone. SRK playing a brash star brat. SRK's abs (of course!). The witty vision of the filmmaker.\n\nAnd finally Farah Khan and SRK's and the entire film industry's bold move to do a take off on the take off, because, when you look at it, the film is not just a take off on '70s Bollywood but also on today's filmy frenzy! With each and every film one thing is sure Shah Rukh Khan will be outstanding and in this film to he is outstanding as well. In this film Shah Rukh Khan shows His comic abilities and he is bang on target. It just goes to show his range and versatility as an actor that on one hand he is doing Chak De! India (Offbeat) and on other hand Om Shanti Om where he is playing to the gallery which came easily only to Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nDeepika has all it takes to be a top star \u0097 the personality, the looks and yes, she's supremely talented too. Standing in the same frame as Shah Rukh Khan and getting it right is no small achievement. She comes as a whiff of fresh air! Arjun Rampal impresses in a negative role which suites his image. Shreyas Talpade compliments Shah Rukh Khan wonderfully. Kirron Kher in one word wonderful.\n\nThe masses will love it; the classes will love it too! The youth will like it too, even though they may not get certain references to the Bollywood of yesteryear's. A must watch."

Sab Chalta hai if we can package it well and get two words of appreciation from the critics. Why so much of talk about Deepika Padukone ? She is no great actress as she has been made to appear .\n\nIf anyone has common sense then we should realize that we have already declared her to be the next best thing even before seeing her on screen ? Ain't we guilty of doing that. Long before movie release,we declared her to be the SuperStar ? (i wonder what kind of superstar were we referring to even before seeing her performance...) This movie is not worth an oounce. Stay away if u have sense and go watch if u are sans sense."

I've not seen Saawariya yet but I am going to.\n\nOm Shanti Om was soooo entertaining, fun, stylish, colourful, emotional and had a very interesting story (which I loved to bits) told in a good format. Also there is not a Bollywood film made about films.\n\nThe first half gave a very good insight of the 70s because this was a rocking decade for Bollywood and I was almost going to cry at the ending of the first half. The second half was even better and reminded me of \"Karan Arjun\". Oh yes! There is a twist in the end that will totally shock you. It was like a delicious desert after a tasty dinner.\n\nMusic is excellent composed by one of my most favourite music directors Vishal & Shekhar. The best songs are Ajab Si, Dard-e-disco, Deewangi Deewangi and Main Agar Kahoon. Dard-e-disco is the best music video I have ever seen of the decade....no wait! the best of the century.\n\nThe film was about 3 hours but all that time was worth it and there wasn't a single boring or useless scene. The best scenes are: Dard-e-disco song of course, Filmfare awards, Deewangi Deewangi song because there where 30 stars and the ending. In Sajid Khan's \"Heyy Babyy\" there where 14 actresses in cameos and he is Farah Khan's brother.\n\nI've not seen Chak De India because I never got the chance but whether you liked Chak De India or not, you will love Om Shanti Om and if you didn't you can beat me up with a hockey stick. Overall I loved the film it was better than I expected and has a lot of fire. (If you know what I mean)"

All in all it was a fun movie to watch and gave us laughs, thrilling moments and moments of emotion as well.\n\nI really recommend seeing this movie on the silver screen vs. waiting for a DVD or an inferior print. This movie is full of vibrant colors and sounds and the cinematic experience really adds value to everything.\n\nDo go out and see it. Its one of the films that come out once in every 3-5 years in bollywood so don't miss it!"

I had high expectations, and I would not create any suspense for you guys. But this movie was not at all what I expected. What a rip-off from Rishi Kapoor starer Karz. I don't know why people are calling this movie a laughter riot, it was so boring. I actually slept during few scenes. It was such a drag. The only reason I am even giving this movie a 2 on 10 is because of the awesome cameo by Akshay Kumar and to see Mithun Da, Dharmendr, and ever hot Rekha do some jiggy and their patent dance movements. Oh man, nothing can beat the oldies.\n\nIt is no way closer to the cult comedy movies like Jaane Bhi Do Yaron, Andaz Apna Apna, and Hera Pheri. Its a one time visit, see it and forget it movie. You do not take anything from it when you leave the theater. Not even a single quote or dialog to remember from the movie. Other than the fact that they made fun of all time superstar, hall of fame, Mr. Rajesh Khanna and couple of other oldies, they broke all the records of being a illogical roller coaster movie. At least old Karz was believable but this one is just a headache. And the ending was even more mythical than existence of Godzilla.\n\nWell, I would suggest you to still go watch it, but I regret spending my $12 on this movie. Could have had cheap Taco Bell 10 times rather than spending that money on movie like this. Its not worth spending that much money on this movie. Damn, should have waited for it to come on DVD."

        "review_detailed_main": "OSO is not extraordinary but is an adequate entertainer.Although it does not justify the hype created but it does not disappoint.Moreso because of the presence of Shahrukh .Farah Khan goes the Manmohan Desai way. Leave you mind at home and go to watch OSO just for fun. And its an out and out fun film. The movie is inspired by Karz,Madhumati and what not. It starts in !977 when Karz is being shot by Subhash Ghai and a junior artist Om (SRK) is dancing. Om is obsessed with bollywood and in particular Shanti Devi ,the star played by Deepika Padukone . In a film shoot, he saves Shanti and finds her favour.He is killed in trying to rescue Shanti who is burnt alive in the studio by Arjun Rampal , a producer.He is reborn as Om Kapoor, a superstar and as usual he remembers all that has happened to him in the previous birth and seeks vengeance. The climax has the ghost of Deepika coming and doing the deed of killing Arjun Rampal. The story is old and the characters jaded. But the presence of SRK is electric.He turns the mundane proceedings by his livewire performance in both births. As the junior artiste, his comic sense is uncanny. As the south Indian superstar he is over the top and as Manoj Kumar he is restrained. He balances the act so beautifully that the first half is over before you know. As the gen next superstar he is full of attitude and his by now famous 6 pack body is in place. The second half is again the same old story a la Karz with the role of Simi Grewal being played by Arjun Rampal. The awards function is awesome and Abhishek and Akshay are at their sporting best. The dance of 31 stars in another attraction . The climax is picked up from Madhumati. Deepika is fresh in both the roles and does justice. Shreya and Kiron Kher support SRK as the best friend and mother respectively. All in all its an entertaining film in which one should not ask any questions, Just have fun and come home.The music by Vishal Shekhar is good and both the 70s and present moment are well represented."

        "review_detailed_main": "We knew all about this-didn't we?\n\nOSo is not a crossover movie, it is not anything path breakingly original(It is heavily inspired from Karz, the concept is), it does not have anything particularly refreshing in terms of story or screenplay..etc.. Yet- OSO succeeds, and that was what Farah and co were gunning for this Diwali.\n\nSrk is back to his old ways -this is a 'true blue' SRk movie, he does all that he is a master at- plus the latest addition or attraction- his bronzed 6 pack!\n\nDoes he succeed? Its very simple- For people who adore Srk in his regular roles, will lap this one up too.\n\nFor someone expecting a Kabir Khan (Chak De) maybe a tad disappointed.\n\nOm Shanti Om is in the league of Main hun Na- in terms of cinematic sensibilities. Its just pure fun woven around a story, but never getting too deep into it. Characters are a bit sketchy, plots get a bit contrived, and clich\u00e9s abound everywhere, yet this movie passes the litmus test-because it is all about the timing too.\n\nIts a perfect package for Diwali - an entertainer and Srk-the country's' biggest brand(arguably)-the combo wont fail.\n\nI am not exactly delving into the story, for most people know what is needed. Yes, its is a bit of a tribute with a zany sense of humour to the 70's, you see the bell bottoms are back, the sideburns, flowery shirts, as the 1st half of the movie is entirely in the 70's.(Srk as the bumbling and goofy Om Makhija)\n\nAnd yes its about reincarnation, following the lines of Karz, Srk being the victim(and also Deepika). Srk is reborn as Om Kapoor now- a hot cool dude and a big shot in Bollywood. It is quite predictable hereon, the twists are few, but well crafted. I just wished the buildup was stronger, the meat in the climax was missing.\n\nFinally- The movie does fit the bill of a good entertainer- Paisa Vasool, will be liked by young and old, I wont be surprised if this does turn out to be the BO winner of the year. Songs are hummable, Dard-E-Disco being a lot of eye -candy(for women). Srk will attract a lot of 'drools'.\n\nAnd the title song with 31 stars is fun too!\n\nThe minuses being just that- it could have had more substance to the characters and the climax a bit more thrilling.It seemed like it ended too soon suddenly. And also some more meat to the 'motive' of Deepika being bumped off by Arjun.(Rampal)\n\nPerformances-Its familiar territory for Srk, believe me its a role which of course was just written for him, though the 2nd half-Om Kapoor seemed a bit clich\u00e9d. His dying sequence compares to his previous movies-will get the audience's empathy. Deepika is pretty and emotes well, not really a lot of meat in her role, but shes quite effective. Kirron Kher Hams, but shes still adorable, she manages to do that with ease. Shreyas Talpade was an interesting choice as Srk's pal, does that with consummate ease.\n\nAnd my award would go to Arjun Rampal- a out and out 'cool negative' role, very suavely done. Its one of his more noticeable performances.\n\nOSO- as mentioned is predictable, and yet fun, it works well for people who want a 3 hr reprieve!Its not what I can call 'Miss not' but still is the best of the current lot."

        "review_detailed_main": "Om Shanti Om and Saawariya premiered the same time as the offerings for the Deepavali holiday, and to see how Hollywood money had influenced a Hindi production, I opted for the latter first. In its opening weekend in the UK, Om Shanti Om had trounced Tom Cruise's Lions for Lambs, so OSO went straight to my must-watch list this week. Moreover, while I have watched movies starring Bollywood King Shah Rukh Khan, I have yet to see him in action on the big screen, so this provided the best opportunity to do so.\n\nAnd he's not called The King for nothing. Here, his roles of Om Prakash Makhija the junior actor in the studio system, and Om Kapoor the superstar, allowed for plenty of room to put his acting chops to good use. For his stature, watching him play a lowly rated actor with big dreams was a hoot, especially when teaming with good friend Pappu (Shreyas Talpade) in sharing those dreams of stardom, and hamming it up for the camera. In a tale of two halves, the first is set in the 70s in a major movie studio where Om Makhija works, and Fate has it that he will become romantically tangled with the hottest starlet of the era, actress Shantipriya (Deepika Padukone in her debut, going head to head with Sonam Kapoor's debut too in Saawariya). But of course the star crossed lovers (aren't they always) are dished a cruel hand, and the movie lunges into the second half, which I should avoid specifics, suffice to say that Shah Rukh's new character Om Kapoor (nicknamed OK), is now a bastard of a superstar, full of arrogance and standing for everything that Om Makhija isn't.\n\nNaturally there is a running theme connecting both portions together, along the lines of the circle of life, karma, retribution and reincarnation. Having two characters essentially allowed the audience a fun time in comparing and contrasting which Om one would prefer, offering a glimpse of what Om Makhija could possibly become if success went to his head. What I always liked about Bollywood, is its run time allowed for plenty of songs, dance (which of course are the enjoyable bits with the colourful sets and costumes all put to good use), and while certain plot development might be clich\u00e9, it does take its time to properly develop the characters, or the leads at least. Om Shanti Om is no different, though there were some overly melodramatic moments, sometimes tongue-in-cheekily offered courtesy by actress Kirron Kher as Bela Makhija, Om's junior actress mother.\n\nThe song and dance again take centerstage, and they were nicely composed for specific purposes in the narrative, one of many reasons why I admire Bollywood. Om Makhija's fantasy sequences with many beautiful costume changes during his scenes of courtship is memorable, but even audacious was Om Kapoor's superstar-like performance with entourage of scantily clad blondes (yes, you read that right) in Dard-E-Disco, where you'll get jealous watching Shah Rukh's well toned abs, and remind yourself to hit the gym more diligently.\n\nBut what made Om Shanti Om truly enjoyable and stand out, is its almost self-deprecating jokes that it cracks on the industry, the movie it makes and the studio system, but then, it's really a celebration of their cinema and how far they have come. For those well versed with Bollywood, there are tons of references and inside jokes that you can't help but to chuckle at, including very well known stars all being very sporty about their cameo roles (hats off to Abishek Bachchan, hahaha!). There were the obvious self-indulgent moments like the post- awards ceremony party, where you'll realize why the opening credits had a huge Thank You list to the Who's Who in Bollywood - having appearances by the stars in one 10 minute segment, is a real treat and a good introduction to rookies like me, who become interested in trying to figure out who they are, besides the recognizable few from movies I've watched before. Performing to Deewangi Deewangi, I thought the other scene that was equally fun, was the Filmfare Awards Ceremony, which was almost laugh-a-minute. Thinking about it while writing this still brings back the laughs!\n\nAs usual, you'd come to expect some moments of familiarity in the movie, and I don't deny that the storyline does seem deja-vu, but again what makes it a delight, is primarily Shah Rukh's magnetism. Director-writer Farah Khan managed to string together comedic moments and balance them with a tender love story that I thought was pretty sad, given its unconventional (but not unpredictable) treatment. Sometimes Bollywood movies are guilty of having set pieces which resemble Hollywood, just like Krrish had a set which looked straight out of John Woo's Paycheck, and here, adopting the special effects sequence for Confession of Pain is hard to deny. But what I thought was a full circle, was the finale song-dance sequence which had the proceedings mimicking screen life, just as how Moulin Rouge had theirs resemble the doomed love affair between Christian and Satine, which in itself had heavy Hindi influences during its own musical sequence.\n\nOm Shanti Om has everything - romance, drama, mystery and the supernatural all rolled into one, and if I had just one word to describe it, it will be \"Remarkable\". Do yourself a favor, and watch it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Farah Khan's 'Om Shanti Om' is easily one of the most entertaining films in recent times. Reason? The film has all that it takes to be a blockbuster, which it became in its box office run. The film has got humor, action, romance, 31 stars appearing in it and fantastic music score. What Else do I need as a film and SRK fan? Nothing, OSO is truly a excellent entertainer in all aspects. Two Thumbs up!\n\nPluses of the film: The film , as said before is a complete entertainer. The music score by Vishal-Shekhar is outstanding. The entire crew has worked amazingly, especially Sabu Cyril who recreates the 70's look to perfection. Solid Performances: Shahrukh is superb. I love him. Arjun Rampal is effective as the villain. Deepika is a superstar material, only one thing? why did she not dub for herself? Shreyas Talpade is natural. Kirron Kher is fabulous. Satish Shah and Bindu are hilarious in cameos. Other are good. The 31 star-studded song elevates the film to a much higher level.\n\nMinuses: The film's second hour is not as impact as its first. The climax is average.\n\nOn the whole, 'Om Shanti Om' is escapist cinema at its best. Watch this all-time blockbuster!"

Its a terrible movie with nothing worth spending time and money. Characters are not even close to \"believable\". Script is worse than what a 4 year old can write. Acting is mediocre. End sequence is boring, lengthy and makes you feel stupid for sitting and lasting the whole movie. I think mainstream Indian cinema has never been progressive, sensible or creative, and OSO proves my point. However, be prepared to hear that it becomes a super-hit back in India as an \"entertainer, masala\" (???) movie!!!"

You shouldn't think much about the principles of continuity when you're watching this genre as it is basically made for the entertainment of general people and not for film critics and professors. This movie had everything what a Bollywood movie should have and this clearly defines the Bollywood Genre.\n\nUsual fantastic acting by Shah Rukh Khan. Special Mention for Shreyas Talpade and Arjun Rampal. Good performance by Deepika Paadukone. I thought that the costume and styling department did a wonderful job in the movie. I've given it a 7 star because the first half wasn't that interesting but as soon as the OK reincarnation appeared in the second half, it became entertaining. The highlight of the movie was the background score which I felt was super. It had the haunting emotional romantic element, but the best part of the movie were the two songs, one which featured all the big superstars of Bollywood and the other the sensational track Dard - E - Disco.\n\nAll in all one should watch it at least once in the theaters."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm Not a big SRK fan yet there was something which made me see OSO, well I'm glad in the end the movie was a joyful ride with loads of popcorn fun. Indian cinema has come of age and we are seeing more meaningful movies being made these days, But OSO follows the usual tried and tested masala formula which eventually works .\n\nThe movie is based on the theme of reincarnation which has been attempted many times before , but if you are a SRK and Farah Khan you have the liberty to do it again and get away with it.In this case get loads of cash and awards for it.I would suggest the viewers not to look for any logic i the movie but simply enjoy what is served to them bcoz it was never meant to satisfy the critics instead its made for the masses and we belong to the same category. Shahrukh excels as 'OM' and proves his versatility once again though he still has to work on emotional scenes.he does a difficult job of portraying two characters belonging to two different time frames. Deepika Padukone couldn't ask for a better film for her debut she looks gorgeous and enacts her part well.Shreyas Talpade plays Om's friend hes okay but its difficult to imagine him as a 60 yr old guy and still being called 'pappu' LOL.Kiron Kher as a mother is good as always.The real surprise is Arjun Rampal Hes tremendous in a villainous role , why not hes getting more good projects. U are gonna hate(Love) this Guy.\n\nThe music is Great like most SRK movies. The songs that stand out are dard-e-disco and deewaangi-deewaangi( which has almost half of the bollywood industry).The jokes successfully make u giggle and sometime can make u burst into laughter if u cannot control urself. Farah knows the taste of audience she sticks with that though sometimes u feel that movie is getting too melo-dramatic.But this doesn't affect the overall content.She has really worked hard to achieve that 70's style look for the movie.\n\nThe movie is expected to bring huge profit for its producers and distributors.Go catch it with a pack of popcorn and please leave your brains out before entering the theater( U will enjoy more in this way)."

Along the way many laughs are to be had but they empty as the script runs out of gags long before the end.\n\nShah Rukh manages to keep the length of it watchable with his boundless charisma but there is little depth to his character. Indeed the main problem is that the characters are all under-written. Shreyas Talpade is almost entirely wasted. As are most of the other characters, such as Kiron Kher who dazzles in her key scenes, but are then left neglected.\n\nDeepika Padukone impresses in her debut, displaying versatility that could pave a successful career forward. Arjun Rampal also gives a rare good performance. In a role that could have been hampered by over-acting, he gives a well-judged tone to it.\n\nThe songs are a highlight, especially the one which utilized slick editing to bring the stars of past and present together. Not quite so much of a highlight was the cameo-filled sequence which runs far longer than it should have.\n\nOverall, the first act could be seen again and again by any fan of Hindi cinema but the full running time would have few watching the movie through to the finish on repeat viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "One ticket and maximum fun; how is the deal? Well deal is on and named Om Shanti Om for you. A Diwali bumper offer from the house of King Khan and of course Farah Khan.\n\nTo start with the story it's more or less reincarnation of Karz by Subhash Ghai, so those who watch it thinking a new stream can stop thinking the same, although the treatment is much advanced and grand with consistent twists and turns. First half deals with successful recreating Era of Golden seventies where one in million Om runs behind and saves life of his \"Dreamy Girl\" Shanti who happens to be the raining superstar then. But when it comes to the happy ending of their saga, life takes a twist and an unfortunate event takes life of both Om and Shanti (I don't want to spoil the suspense plot here).\n\nWhile the second half starts with the current time, Om Kapoor who is raining superstar now is a star son of seventies superstar Rajesh Kapoor who was in a way involved in the story of first part. With some twist and turns in the story, Om recalls his past life that he is a rebirth of Om and he is on a mission to accomplish the left task from his past life with the help of Sandy (Sandhya) who apparently is his biggest fan. That's the end of story.\n\nKudos to Farah Khan that she was so right in making this film by including all the ingredients in the movie; be it comedy, romance, emotion, drama or suspense. Movie is to its entire stretch a treat to watch. Music background was also very nice by Vishal and Shekar; each song comes with the requirement not as if they are padded just to feel the time; lyrics make them even more soothing while listening. Sets that recreate the seventies Era are fabulous and makes scenic pleasure entire movie. From the cast SRK rocks undoubtedly, I must say I liked this one the most of his entire performances till date. He had a tough task this time to match with a young girl Deepika as a pair and didn't both look stunning together, just picture perfect. I can write ten pages praising SRK for his show this time but let's get on to others. Kirron Kher is remarkable in her performance, the scene between her and SRK in second half would bring tears to your eyes. Shreyas was as good as he could, he and SRK were brilliant together almost every where in movie. Pick of the movie is Arjun Rampal, be sure to get surprised with the role he is playing in the movie; he steals the show when ever he comes on the frame. Now comes my favorite part: Deepika!! I wish the dialog SRK says \"when you love someone from the bottom of your heart entire world backs you\" come true for me. She is a Diva, no more Katrina for me now; it's all Deepika from now onwards. Watch out her in forthcoming ventures, this time other than her mesmerizing smile she had very little to do in front of the big shots in the movie.\n\nI highly recommend this one to everyone; go out and have healthy fun."

I guess the vision for this movie was obviously somewhat deluded and can be blamed on Farah Khan's hormones!! The actual songs from the movie are not bad, and the costumes that the main actress wears are nice but that's the only good thing I can say about this film. I ended up walking out half way through and totally did not enjoy it. I would certainly not recommend this film to anyone unless you want to waste your money and get bored!!"

The songs really rock. Above all OSO was a entertainer but for sure the Khan magic of Chak De was missing.\n\nI didn't carry anything home but the 70's magic which touched the inmost chords of my heart.

        "review_detailed_main": "From the time Om Shanti Om and Saawwariya were announced, tremendous hype was there throughout India. People began discussing which one would be better, would a masala film like OSO be able to beat the film made by a sensible director like Sanjay Leela Bhansali?\n\nThere was more discussion when both the films were going to be released on the same day. Then came rumors and controversies of Sanjay being furious at Farah and what not. And the mega hype of Shah Rukh Khan's six packs made it the headline of every magazine. Both the films tried their best to overthrow each other in every possible way.\n\nRanbir and Sonam promoted their film by coming as special guests in reality shows like Jhalak Dikhla Ja and Star Voice of India while Shah Rukh Khan visited Nach Baliye,Deepika and Farah visited Nach Baliye and it think they visited Sa Re Ga Ma Pa too, Deepika and Shreyas went to Star Voice of India. Ranbir's towel scene became a hit among girls. Worse was, there were rumors that there was a feud between Ranbir of Saawariya and his friend Deepika.\n\nOn top of that, the 31 stars dance was too taken into consideration. Who were invited? Who did not turn up? And what not. Both the films launched their music albums and songs were sung in both reality shows Sa Re Ga MA Pa and Star Voice of India.\n\nThere was so much of these going on that I was completely fed up. I had an aversion to the Saawariya songs that were played so many times in my ears almost everywhere and got bored listening to songs of Om Shanti Om for the same reason. I even stopped watching these reality shows whenever the stars of these two movies turned up.\n\nAt last when the two movies released, people rushed inside theaters to enjoy the two movies that they had always been waited for. The verdict: Om Shati Om was good, saawariya was bad. Then too, Om Shanti Om was not exactly given mind blowing reviews. Just another masala film that would entertain the audience. MAny people even did not like the film and compared it to Karz.\n\nI had gone with three families to watch this movie yesterday. Both the film makers were smart enough to release it during Diwali when it was holiday time and people mostly lingered around cinema halls. I even ignored the horrible review my friend's family had given about this movie.\n\nAfter watching the movie, I was really happy with the film. It wasn't a Dhamaka but was a real entertainer. So most of the audience even watched the subtitles. What I loved about the film that Farah Khan not only ridicules actors of Bollywood in the film but makes fun of herself. You'll know when you see the end subtitle. Even the spot boys and camera men are given a warm welcome in the subtitles and are shown respect.\n\nThis movie isn't Shah Rukh Khan's career best performance but it is still very good, though it got a little hammy in the second half. Deepika must be good for a new comer but I did not exactly like her acting very much and felt she had a problem speaking Hindi and so looked a bit rehearsed, but she was extremely beautiful. Shreyas was good as usual but the person whom I liked a lot was Kiron Kher as the over-acting mother. The conversations between Shah Rukh and her were hilarious. Arjun was surprisingly good and sophisticated but he should understand that he should do side roles only and not act in the lead role.\n\nThe seventies period was created really well. THe accent, huge nest-like hair, mannerisms all were done with perfection. Farah Khan has mocked almost all actors of the filmdom but it is funny rather than being rude. The dialogs were really good though the film slowed down a bit in some parts. The songs sounded even more beautiful, thanks to the magnificent choreography by Farah Khan.\n\nThe second half too was good but not as good as the first half. I felt that many of the scenes that were supposed to be serious were shown in a funny way. It looked more childish for a revenge. The end could be clearly understood from before and was predictable.\n\nBut overall, it was a good-great film. Therefore, I give it a seven out of ten."

First off all: the plot simply continues in the second part, that is a big relieve. Secondly, it is fun to watch and even the end credits are fun compare with most other movies. The story is not to bad, and even the acting of people like Shreyas Talpade is great. I think the supporting actors are actually doing much better than the leading role. But I advice you, keep an eye on the female leading actress, we will surely hear more from her in the future! The moment they open a huge tin can of Bollywood stars is a fest of recognition although it has no real meaning in this movie. The weakest part: the film fare awards ceremony in this film.

Its a good narrated story with good acting and direction. I was earlier disappointed to see Main Hoon Na also made by Farah Khan....So I was hoping to see a better direction with better plot. But I think after watching this one can say that they somehow got confused in the end to end this movie with some better ending. Its just a comparison between first and second half. First half is full of emotions...colours...comedy and I would say better acting than the second half. Shahrukh is good in first half but he wasn't able to justify the role in second half. Though anyone would say that he really worked on his muscles and it is clearly visible in song 'Dard E Disco'. Deepika was fantastic on her part. Being a newcomer...I wasn't really expecting her to come as good. One can say that Farah really tried to give everyone a good role and altogether everyone performed well but Suresh could have been used in a better way.\n\nIn the end it looks a like a combination of so many oldies from bollywood...like karz and others. I would recommend all to see this movie but don't expect a lot. Farah has a long way to go"

But get ready to hear and see what he has never said before. Sample this \"overacting is in my family\". Even admitting \"The heart is NRI\". And i loved it.\n\nI think everyone knows whats the story is all about. And if you don't, then you must be in some never-land because SRK and his gang are everywhere. Just tell them the address of the place, they will reach faster than you can imagine to promote the film even at your never-land. Farah is not ashamed to admit what she likes and what kind of film she aspires to make. She has always been honest about it and O.S.O. is all about that. Its MTV-style spoof from start to finish. Its not great cinema. Its just good entertainment, everything BOLLYWOOD style!! its the Alchemist philosophy at work\u0085\"when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true.\" Its all about \"Happy End\" else its not the end friends!! You will get to see whatever you are expecting with some little twists and turns here and there. SRK is in typical SRK form. The film belongs to him from start to finish. Everyone else is just extra. Deepika Padukone doesn't have much to do except look good and show some cleavage. Is good in whatever she is supposed to be. For the first time, Arjun Rampal acts and yes does it well. The typical bollywood villain!! Kirron Kher is the typical Hindi film mummy with full crying scenes and drama!! The sequences where they have showed the 70's films on big screen have been done pretty well. It's great nostalgia to see them on big screen. Now who would not like to dance to Chintu Uncle's \"OM SHANTI OM\" song..(remember that scene in Shekhar Kapoor's Masoom\u0085mummy, have a look, its chintu uncle on TV om shanti om!). And here, you will have many more from that era.\n\nKept on wondering if SRK really prayed for the \"Khan\" surname in his last birth and got his wish granted. I seriously think that something like that happened. And this is what i liked most about the film\u0085.they are showing the middle finger to everyone. And people have no option but to laugh. Can bet that SRK is laughing his way to the bank again.\n\nThe not so great actor but the biggest star of bollywood has finally dared to laugh at himself. You should not miss out. What the film is about A kitschy present-day, Farah Khan take-off on the ultra-popular '70s Bollywood potboiler that, in her own words is a tribute to film-making. But this is a Hindi movie and you have to leave your brains out, or so the filmmaker is telling you.\n\nThe film is more than a take off on the re-birth formula, made famous by Karz in the '70s than a tribute; but it does brilliantly. Farah Khan has made everyone act superbly. There are so many things to watch out for so we will just list a few highlights: The cameos by almost the entire industry, The fantastic one-liners from '70s Bollywood; the digital effects ala Forrest Gump. SRK playing a brash star brat. SRK's abs (of course!). The witty vision of the filmmaker.\n\nAnd finally Farah Khan and SRK's and the entire film industry's sassiness to do a take off on the take off, because, when you look at it, the film is not just a take off on '70s Bollywood but also on today's filmy frenzy! Blockbuster! The masses will love it; the classes will love it too! The NRIs will gobble it up and froth over it and the youth, even though they may not get certain references to the Bollywood of yesteryear's and even the line \"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn\", will love it! SRK is King.\n\nCut the crap, cut the will-it-won't-it work drama. Shah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan's OM SHANTI OM is a true-blue spicy entertainer. If MAIN HOON NA was a chauka, this one hits a six! Wait, a word of advice to all readers across the globe. Don't, for God's sake don't, raise exclamations like when?, why? where? as OM SHANTI OM begins to unravel. This is atypical Manmohan Desai film presented in a novel form by Farah Khan. It's definitely not for pseudos or advocates of art-house cinema.\n\nVishal-Shekhar's music is first-rate. The score is in sync with the content of the film and what accentuate the goings-on are the choreography and execution. Although every song is visually enticing, the 31-star track as also 'Dard-E-Disco' will have the masses going into a frenzy.\n\nNow let's clear some myths surrounding OM SHANTI OM. Is it the 2007 adaptation of Subhash Ghai's immensely likable reincarnation film KARZ? Does it have traces of KUDRAT? Or KARAN ARJUN? Hold on, there's a dash of KARZ, a bit of KARAN ARJUN, but beyond that it's a film that makes you nostalgic about 1970s Bollywood.\n\nOm To sum up, OM SHANTI OM is full entertainment package. We haven't seen SRK in a hardcore spicy film since quite some time. He had drifted to other genres, which proved his range as an actor of repute and cemented his status further. With OM SHANTI OM, he gives back to the audience what he himself grew up on \u0097 a thorough entertainer that will have the audience thirsting for more."

        "review_detailed_main": "After hearing all about this movie's success, listening to it's soundtrack, and hearing about how it's pure entertainment, I was really looking forward to watching this film today. I had heard such great things, that I was hoping to finish and give it at least 8/10 stars, and a glowing review...\n\nUnfortunately, the movie earns neither of these things from me. While I wasn't a huge fan of Farah Khan's last film, Main Hoon Na, I did enjoy it's satire of a typical Bollywood film- separated family, OTT action scenes, violin players coming out of nowhere whenever the girl approached- it was just some great fun, but still had a good plot and decent characters that allowed MHN to stand on it's own as a film.\n\nThe same can't be said about OSO, which feels less like the spoof of the 70s film I was expecting than a string of funny skit-like spoofs, weakly tied together by a reincarnation plot. But what seems to be a bigger problem is that it's hard to tell where the to draw the line between the purposefully over the top acting and the truly serious stuff. Even knowing that it was meant to be over the top, the more serious scenes (which were needed to move the plot forward) just annoyed me.\n\nI know that most people's definition of \"masala entertainer\" means \"no brains required\", but that to me does not mean that the movie should have no coherent plot or likable characters. Some of my favorite SRK masala films- like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, for example, are entertaining for me because of the way they make us care for the characters, even though their situation may seem a little ridiculous or unbelievable. I felt no such connection to anyone in OSO, and that to me, took away a lot of the \"entertainment\" factor.\n\nThe film has some plus points- there are a few really funny scenes that do a pretty good job of mocking Bollywood. (my fav was the Filmfare Awards- that was absolutely perfect) Also, the music is excellent- probably my favorite soundtrack from Vishal and Shekar.\n\nOverall, if you don't care much about plot or characters in your entertainment film, I highly recommend this one. But if you're like me, and you prefer your \"mindless entertainment\" to at least make a little bit of sense, this may not be the film for you."

This quality which was unmistakable in Main Hoon Na gains further prominence in Om Shanti Om.\n\nThis is a big movie, well and truly in love with itself. And if you aren't into that sort of thing, if you pooh-pooh Koffee With Karan, and if you'd really rather watch a movie you have to think about, skip this. For the SRK-hater, the warning is doubly applicable. This is a celebration of the ultimate in self-achievement, Shah Rukh toasting his own indomitable Khan-do spirit."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is Diwali - we are stuffed to the gills with Chaat and Mithai and rolling down the freeway in pouring rain to catch Om Shanti Om. Tickets were booked in advance and there is a roiling crowd outside who are waiting for scalpers so they can catch the film. We are a few minutes late and arrive at the Dhoom Taana song and can only sit in the front row with our necks craning back. The 70s are flying by at a bewildering pace as the crowd roars at the dance in the aisles, the OmiSwaami sequence with the Baaad pussy Atti Katti, and Bhaagoooo. Shantipriya is saved in true Mother India style, meets Om and he is dumbstruck and can only contort his face as words bubble and seethe inside his head. The friendship seems to blossom into something else until the fateful day when poor Om dreams are shattered. And then the arch nemesis dressed all in black traps the star in an inferno and even the bit star is unable to save her. FF to 30 years later and now the bit star is indeed born with a Kapoor name and is a Brattish superstar. The laughs get thinner although we do have the outside Chaddi wearing Mohabbat man, \"handicapped\" love, and the near romance with Bindu! Shanti is now a bubblegum blowing Sandy who swoons at Om every time. And then Mike Urf Mukesh comes back into Om's life. The spoof turns a bit serious and moves from Karz to Madhumati. In the end good will triumph otherwise this picture will not end, will it? The pluses: The laughter quotient is very high, do not eat or drink in the first half or you may be in danger of choking. If you like slapstick, then just the wrestling with the large stuffed tiger and then the flying fight should be enough to keep you happy for a while. If you like satire then you will surely like the \"Ek camera Manmohan Desai ke angle Se Bhi Laga Dena!\", \"Bhoot? Maine us se Kaha Tha Ki Bina Makeup Ke Nahin Jaana!\", \"Apan Nam Badal ke Kapoor Kar Dena, tab u Zaroor Bada hero ban Jayega!\" O.K. saying \"Overacting to mere Khandaan mein hai\" had the hall in stitches.\n\nThe music is melodious, but there are way too many songs - maybe the sequences that used these could have been shorter? The funniest song is no doubt Darde Disao - the lead up from \"handicapped love\" to the song, the end moments of the song and finally the \"handicapped\" lover in his wheel chair - these are precious moments! Main Agar Kahoon is super romantic and ironically real in a fake world and enacted between people who act for a living. The mega stars song is a who's who sequence and fun - Tabu looks super hot in Red and Rekha is as sexy as ever.\n\nThe performances are very good. SRK is the heart and soul of OSO - making fun of himself and overacting like there is no tomorrow in the process. If ever there was a need to go over the top this was it and he delivers superbly in the first 70s half and very well in the second superstar half. Deepika is beautiful and acts well in the scenes where she has the opportunity - she will go far is my prediction. Arjun is great and Shreyas is a show stealer. Kiiron Kher and Bindu shine. Akki and Abhishek are rip roaring funny in a minute each of screen time.\n\nI wish it had stayed a spoof and not ventured into the realm of the serious. The second half dragged a tiny bit, but in the end one is hugely entertained, I might have to see the film again and revisit my review!"

But this is what makes Indian cinema so special to me - three hours of full-on entertainment. The Badshah rocks and new girl Deepika is charming as the ''dreamy girl''. The supporting cast do a really great job as well with Arjun Rampal doing a wonderful turn as the villain (and if I ever see him in the street I'll probably give him a proper kick to the crotch). The cinematography is fantastic and it took all my self-control not to get up and dance in the isles during the song sequences. Yes, its a spoof, but a good-natured one at that (it's really nice to see that the actors can take the mickey of themselves).\n\nThe King Khan still reigns!!! and My Filmi of the Year!!!"

The movie taken me by surprise; I had no expectation still brought DVD to add it to my new Bollywood Movies collection and started watching it on weekend sipping tea before going to bath ...I was just waiting for that usual bore moment to stop the movie and take a shower....but I surprisingly completed the whole movie before shower. There are some moments where it feels like dragging but still movie has great music and that let you remain seated. Story is typical incarnation stuff that we seen in yesteryear movies; even old dialogs used in the movie looks very funny. Shahrukh has done a tremendous job and I liked his energy in the movie; especially the South Indian actor role he done was well made and shows the much misunderstood lighter side of it. Other actors also performed well like the main actress Deepika and Shreyas Talpade is great. Arjun Rampal is good as usual.\n\nHad there been new story when all the movie set and costumes are shown of 70s then it would not have been a good movie....so I think people watching the movie knew from start what is coming next and that is the strength of the movie and Farah Khan did the great job by showing us the things differently; the Manoj Kumar part was not funny though. The twist or lack of there of was taken from Madhumati and make sense for a good ending...but second part is not made in style and the revenge element is visible enough to eat up the whole humor and we knew where the movie is moving now...\n\nStill great movie, old style set and more closer look to the life of people behind and front of the camera....I would give this movie 6 out of 10 overall and can say that it is watchable even if you don't want to spend sometime before shower.."

The only negative element I found is its storyline in the second half.\n\nSRK and Farah Khan have put lot of efforts to make this wonderful movie, and it has paid off. I'd rate this 8/10.\n\nThe movie leaves you humming some very good tunes like Ajab si ajab si adayein hai........"

I am totally unsatisfied with this type of film making . Fara Khan should learn that SRK's acting sucked big time as in this movie as was her directing. Total garbage script. I like over acting comedy as i thought it would be. But Alas it was one of the worst movie of the year. The movie has some audience only because it is promoted so well, people expect so much from it .. but its a time waste . I think Katrina Kaif's 'Maine Pyaar Kyun Kia' was much better movie than this unworthy movie of Farah Khan and SRK. Only positive part was Deepika .. WOW ... brilliant performance from her in her debut in the small role she had. She look beautiful."

It pleases the NRI population that has only seen 6 Hindi films till date, and all of them are either Yash Chopra-SRK or Karan Johan-SRK films! It's obvious that they will like the movie as they've not had the opportunity to watch better Hindi Cinema. SRK is their world! The other segment it is targeted at is the teenyboppers or the masses that admire SRK for being a self-made star! They too know very little about good Hindi cinema to realize that they're being served sub-standard fare! Movies & actors that deserve a dekko are Seher & Arshad Warsi! OSO has SRK hamming to the hilt! His characters are playful but there is no effort at making them seem believable. Deepika is beautiful and seems to have transitioned well from looking good to emoting.\n\nFarah & SRK are worshippers of the mainstream masala commercial Bollywood file? Fine! But they must do justice to the moviegoer & not insult his intelligence. OSO insults the intelligence of the moviegoer with SRK hamming in all the scenes.\n\nMain Hoon Na to was an over the top masala film, but at least the overall product was believable. It entertained & didn't take the viewer for granted. OSO does & therefore disappoints! There is a better review of this film than mine.

        "review_detailed_main": "Om Shanti Om is clearly an extremely meta film, and as a newbie to the films of Bollywood, many of the references and guest appearances were lost on me. Ordinarily, I think I would be annoyed by a movie making me feel like an outsider looking in, but there's so much more to this movie than just references and knowing winks at the audience. The movie is hilarious in the way the jokes are constructed, and that the movie and actors in it are willing to laugh at themselves a little. This film has a great cast, and I like how they know when they don't have to be subtle with a joke. Some of them are almost Monty-Python levels of over-the-top and I was laughing right along with it. The other thing I loved about the script was all the blatant foreshadowing that they lay out for the audience, and everything they set up pays off in a satisfying way. They do this on many levels including when they start to blur the lines between what is happening in the main plot and what happens in the movies within the movie.\n\nFrom what I understand, most Bollywood films include some good song-and-dance numbers, and Om Shanti Om definitely delivered when it came to the tunes. I was tapping my toes, singing along, and having a joyous time as I watched the elaborate sets, costumes, and choreography that went into each number. I was so captivated, that when they played the titular song in the score later in the film, I was still humming along and singing the lyrics in my head. What's truly wonderful about Om Shanti Om is that it has all the things I've mentioned (music, smart scripting, comedy, and an abundance of meta references) but it also has a wonderful love story, and revenge plot, too. I am a sucker for a good romance, and I liked how this movie developed the relationship more than simply having it be a love-at-first-sight kind of thing. As you can tell, I found Om Shanti Om a joy from start to finish. I can come up with a nitpick or two when I really think about it, so it won't instantly become an all-time favorite, but I don't want to dwell on the negatives because the whole film-watching experience was such a good time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Om Shanti Om is a story of love and betrayal Om Shanti Om is a story of a person who makes his dreams come true and becomes a successful actor. Om Shanti Om is also a love story of a popular actress and her fan. It is a story of a fan who does everything to protect his favorite actress from all kind of trouble and even after that actresses murder, does all that he can to give her justice. Nice combination of all these different stories, making it a little longer to 3 hours. Songs, lyrics and music of this film deserve a huge applause because this is the thing which adds more value to the story. Each of the songs in the film are so beautiful that they can either touch you or take you to an imaginary romantic world. All the actors did a good job. The use of too many stars in the award function sequence is one thing that will surely go down in history. Prominent faces right from the yesteryears till today were shown in that particular song sequence. The effort to bring them all together in one sequence one by one needs to be commended. Of all the different stories I have mentioned above in the introduction, two particular stories really tried to impress me: one of the popular actress and fan. Second:a person following his dreams and becoming successful actor. One of my favorite dialogues from the film, 'kisi cheez ko dil se chaho ... to puri kainaat usse tumse milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai'. Very motivational message. Simple dialogue but has deeper meaning. This film has everything: comedy, love, action and drama. This picture has all different type of emotions, happy, sad etc whatnot. One needs to surely watch this film. He/she will like it. Special shoutout needs to go for the makers for showing faces of all the staff of this film, right from producer, director to lightman, dressman, spotboy. Usually not seen in movies. Good thought."

If you ever wondered what the fuss is all about you should watch this.\n\nIt's not acknowledged as a classic Bollywood movie but it is possibly the most accessible one to introduce non-Indians to this rich and amazing genre. As with lots of Bollywood movies, it's a love story, it's an over the top melodrama with more cliches than you knew actually existed, It's got every emotion, every passion, lust, revenge, an evil baddie, a handsome hero and a beautiful damsel in distress.\n\nWhat doesn't quite work are the comedy parts. Every country has its own different sense of humour so English viewers might find the humour a little unsophisticated. The supposedly funny section is only at the beginning so you've just got to get over that first 30 minutes.\n\nThe story is again a popular Bollywood trope: reincarnation but Farah Khan, choreographer turned director turns what ostensibly sounds like a silly story into something amazing. It's completely watchable and thoroughly engaging thanks to a big part by the two stars. Shah Rukh Khan, THE Bollywood megastar shows why he's the highest paid actor in the world and Deepika Padukone shows why she is unquestionably the most beautiful woman in the world.\n\nYou will enjoy this."

        "review_detailed_main": "How many movies you've seen have been very unrealistically unbelievable? This movie is easily and most definitely the most senseless movie you would ever see. It will blow your mind to pieces, for it has not even a hint of reason.\n\nLet me tell you this unbelievable story, It is a story of a junior artist Om Prakash Makhija(Shahrukh Khan) who wants to become a lead actor. He loves the top actress Shanti Priya, played by Deepika Padukone, and wants to marry her. Om once saves Shanti Priya from a fire accident during the shooting, and in the process develops a friendship with her. Shanti Priya is already in love with a big Producer, and becomes pregnant from him. But this big producer guy does not want to marry this woman(Shanti Priya) anymore, and there ensues a big emotional argument, Producer then burns her to death, and Om who has been silently watching this argument tries to save her and in the process dies himself.\n\nThen the second part, Om Prakash Makhija is born again as Om Kapoor, son of a superstar, and a superstar himself.And there is a person who just looks like Shanti Priya, but is not her reincarnation. Om Prakash Makhija's mother then sees Om Kapoor accidentally and thinks that her son is reincarnate, and goes to him and tells about his past reincarnation, then Om Kapoor gets memory of his past birth, and then Om Kapoor, his mother, his friend of past birth(who never ages), and Shanti Priya look alike set to extract revenge from this Producer. Then rest of story ensures ridiculousness in high amount, and we end up becoming confused.\n\nThe songs, dances, are intermixed in the movie to produce an horrible effect. Too much sentiment is packed in the movie. There is nothing much in the movie other than Shahrukh Khan's 6 pack, Deepika's Amazing body. Direction, Story, and various other departments fail miserably.What makes this movie so unbelievable are the scenes, the logic, and the most unnatural characters. No depth at all, it does not look like a standard movie made for world audiences, rather looks like a movie made to impress mental patients.Shahrukh Khan is a good actor, and we cannot bear him wasting his talents in a garbage like this.\n\nDon't watch it unless you want to become insane!!!!"

This is not to say the plot is weak, but unless they're an old Bollywood film buff, the storyline, parodies and references are unlikely to have an impact on the viewer. If they are though, they're in for a treat. This movie is comic, emotional, nostalgic and heartfelt all at the same time. It is best described as a period-fantasy love drama.\n\nThere are two reasons this film is remembered for today - one, for being Deepika Padukone's debut (surprisingly impressive), and second, for being pitted against Saawariya in a now regrettably ugly campaign as both films were being released on the same day. To be frank, I love both films now but back in the day I couldn't look past the tragic beauty of Saawariya which I saw first and so I couldn't appreciate Om Shanti Om for the beautiful film it is.\n\nFirstly, the acting from the entire cast - including SRK, Deepika Padukone, Arjun Rampal, Kirron Kher, Shreyas Talpade is commendable. I especially loved the chemistry between Talpade and SRK. The music is wonderful and each song is memorable. The costumes, sets and production design made me feel nostalgic for a time period I didn't even exist in. My biggest issue is the length and editing of the film, but one can also argue that the whole vengeance subplot wouldn't have felt earned otherwise. Then there are also a few jokes I felt weren't in good humour as they involved some real people. But overall, a wholesome tribute to the quintessential Bollywood masala film genre."

Karz director Subhash Ghai and hero Rishi Kapoor even had special appearances in this movie. Directed by good friend Farah Khan and produced by wife Gauri this is a Shah Rukh Khan film from the minute go till the end.\n\nShah Rukh Khan was fantastic and Deepika provided good support, Arjun Rampal however wasn't good in his role. Om Shanti Om pokes fun at the film industry. The songs were fabulous, especially Dard-e Disco and Dewaangi, where over 30 film stars make special appearances. The ending was brilliant, there is even a twist at the end. Om Shanti Om was fun all the way. Subhash Ghai should be proud to call Om Shanti Om a remake of his movie."

If you are a Bollywood fan, I don't even think I need to say more. Chances are you have watched it and loved it. The film doesn't take itself too seriously and is just pure, fun movie. Also, watch \"Karz\" if you haven't. You'll see what I mean as I don't want to give anything away. For the non-Bollywoodites...watch for the title track \"Om Shanti Om\". Big hit in India but also resonates with Westerners. Do I recommend this film? More than probably any other film I can.

The most disappointing factor of this movie is Shah Rukh Khan's acting. The first half of his Om Prakash portrayal was tolerable...but what happened to Om Kapoor? Why is he so pathetic. Acting was immeasurably annoying...too over-dramatic, gee, there's a limit to what one can take. It's just disgusting seeing such a well-established, sophisticated, mature actor...trying to look all swell like Salman or whoever but looking completely foolish. Why can't he just be a natural actor and not try to be like someone else for God sake. Moreover, the movie was fully predictable, exaggerated performances (can't figure out whether that was Farah's intention), a total masala movie, a dis to ones intelligence and a complete mockery of the Indian Cinema.\n\nI believe the only reasons to why it gained tremendous fame at the box-office are because of the countless star appearances and of course, SRK-FK pair. Otherwise i find no other reasons to why the movie is empowering the rest. However, I didn't expect much from Farah as a director but I did expect quite a lot more from SRK as an ACTOR. In the end, we always count on the actor, sometimes not taking much account of the direction.\n\nTherefore, I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie if you're looking for some intense performances or a good story. But if you're willing to take the risk, then do so. Or unless you're an ardent fan of SRK and Farah, then there's no one stopping you."

But it would be better to say that \"Alain Chabat\" is the French Farah Khan.\n\nLet us say that Farah has already made the worst with Main Hoon Na (2004) where the right Hindi is broadly attacked with a lot of humor. With humor it trickles down in every minute. Principal actor you, the big, the one, the only, the king Shah Rukh Khan \u0096 his spouse is productive of the film, reason for which undoubtedly there are lot of sequence with him - is forty-year, so cute, but forty really. He introduces us a torso of first young person to make turn pale generations going up, and it is in excess, such as Farah is able of showing it, as created gap and irony of the sequence of dance Dard-e-Disco. Also I recommend the film fare sequence where numerous actors, stars not questioned by the millions of audience of the films of industry of Bombay, take part in the game of the gibe of their fame, as seldom an actor is able of making it. We are not capable of realizing to what extent references to the Indian cinema are referred. But one is recognized even by a french : in the mouth of one of those which plays a movie director: \" I would make an angle as Satyagit Ray an angle as Bimal Roy and an angle as Guru Dutt \", \" happy you to make your own angle ! \", answers him fop producer come to shake the main actress who makes a last minute fad. (I think that she claims his wage! She has a brass neck!). Il like this film and also I love Farah!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the second movie with Shah Rukh \"King\" Khan that has been a tremendous hit, the other being \"Chak De India.\" \"Om Shanti Om,\" the title based on the early 1980's song from Subash Ghai's \"Karz,\" has Om, a junior artist in the 1970's Bollywood who has dreams of becoming a star. He then meets the well known actress, Shantipriya and falls in love with her. But then tragedy strikes and he finds out that Shantipriya is pregnant by the man who had introduced her into the movie industry - Mukesh Mehra, who will stop at nothing to continue with his career and will not allow anyone to destroy it. The movie stars Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika, Kirron Kher, Arjun Rampal and Shreyas Talwade and the Pakistani actor / Director, Javed Sheikh and Bindu.\n\nDirected by Farah Khan, the opening sequence, consists of the song \"Om Shanti Om\" from the movie \"Karz\" and a very young Rishi Kapoor can be seen in the song along with the Director of the movie, Subash Ghai. Shah Rukh is just fantastic in his role as \"Om.\" Deepika, considering that this is her first Hindi movie, has also performed well, as have Kirron Kher, Shreyas Talwade and Arjun Rampal. The seventies era has been superbly re - created by Farah Khan and the Producer Gauri Khan. In one scene a very young and romantic Rajesh Khanna can be seen. Since this is based on movies and acting, naturally, Farah Khan has kept it as realistic as possible by including scenes involving the Filmfare awards and the party that normally follows its. This also means that various Directors and actors also make an appearance - Yash Chopra, Karan Johar, Subash Ghai, Rakesh Roshan and Hrithik Roshan, Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan,Shilpa Shetty, Kajol, Rani Mukherjee, Juhi Chawla just to mention a few. And yes, Shah Rukh \"King\" Khan does show his \"six pack\" by removing his shirt in a song. In terms of Box office takings, it is estimated that this has earned three quarters of a million pounds in the first week in the United Kingdom only. Worldwide, it is believed to be much, much higher - at least another three times.\n\nThis is a movie that is worthwhile and can be enjoyed with your family as it also has some good humour even if it means that a certain \"Mr Bharat\" wants to take Shah Rukh Khan to court."

The 6.5 rating as of yet for this movie is most probably the reason of love towards Shahrukh Khan from his fans.\n\nThis movie deserves a 4/10 from me."

Shahrukh worked hard for this film gaining a six pack in the process. The songs are lovely in this film especially Main Agar Kahoon being the best. The movie has it all action, comedy, romance, adventure and supernatural. The best thing about this is the Deewangi song where there are many superstars in one song.

They don't have a standard approach to judge a movie. The script is full of flaws and most of the plots doesn't make any sense, but the critics overlooked them mentioning its a brainless masala entertainer. masala entertainment is fine for general public but the job of a movie critics is to watch the movie with a magnifying glass. It was the same Rajeev Masand who gave Shirish Kunder's Jaan-e-mann a thumbs down saying it has taken too much cinematic liberty and lacks a genuine script. How did he overlook the flaws in the script of his wife's movie. The plot where Shanti is killed is the main flaw of the movie. The whole murder plot and Arjun not even being suspected for it must have been written with a digestible logic. and again in the climax arjun gets killed in a more unbelievable way when he faints in middle of the hall full of people and later SRK shooting at him. This contradicts the existence of the whole plan to convict Arjun of the crime with the help of sandy as in the end SRK never proved his crime. Except for a few one liners and a couple of great comedy scenes(shooting of mind it and Filmfare awards) the movie is a drag. It just relies heavily on SRK's star power. I must give credit to Farah Khan for making a movie on the film industry but it was a let down to me since Main Hoon Na was an much better masala flick yet it had a sound script."

        "review_title": "Pure enjoyment in this salute to '70's Hindi cinema...",
        "review_detailed_main": "Growing up in 1970's India automatically implied a steady diet of Hindi masala films. They were deliciously lowbrow extravaganzas packed with songs and dances, melodrama, overwrought plot lines that were pinched from any number of sources, and amusingly huge lapses of continuity and logic. This \"formula\" had several practitioners, the foremost being Manmohan Desai, whose \"Amar, Akbar, Anthony\" had scenes of inspired looniness that remain unrivaled to this day. Of course, they were silly, but they were magnificent fun, and are all the more beloved because they date back to our childhood. It seemed the world was young and carefree, so full of promise, optimism, and potential that even the most implausible Hindi film somehow seemed credible.\n\nThirty years later, Farah Khan has made \"Om Shanti Om\", an ode to that era of Indian cinema. With great affection, the film references the blockbusters, the garish fashions (that we faithfully mimicked and thought so groovy), the stars, and the melodramatic story lines of that time. Magpie-like, Farah has filched bright and shiny objects of improbable provenance to embellish her homage to the films of her (and our) childhood. I read somewhere that she conjured up the idea for \"Om Shanti Om\" while she was a house-guest of Andrew Lloyd-Webber. Sir Andrew, himself a practitioner of the deliciously lowbrow, might be flattered that in her film, Farah has staged a number reminiscent of his own \"Masquerade\" from his long-running, yet soulless \"The Phantom of the Opera\". Like him, she has assigned a rather important role to a lighting fixture, and used a symphonic orchestra as back-up band (the Prague Philharmonic\u0097certainly a first in Hindi cinema) for her hero's show-stopping final\u00e9.\n\nAlong with these new elements, she includes nods to actors, famous films, and thanks to the magic of CGI, even a brilliant number where her leading lady sings and dances with major stars of yesteryear.\n\n\"Om Shanti Om\" opens with the shooting of the 1980 Subhash Ghai hit \"Karz\". (Avid cin\u00e9philes know \"Karz\" was \"inspired\" by the American film \"The Reincarnation of Peter Proud\".) In fact, the song \"Om Shanti Om\" is being filmed on Rishi Kapoor, the hero of \"Karz\", and Om, the background performer (junior artiste, in Hindi film parlance) hero of \"Om Shanti Om\", is one of the faceless members of the audience. Om's most sincere dream is to be a big star someday, and like an Indian Walter Mitty (and some clever use of CGI), he imagines himself in Rishi Kapoor's place, in a silver lam\u00e9 glam-rock jumpsuit, basking in the applause and adulation of screaming fans. Om has another, just as unattainable dream: Shantipriya, the most successful and glamorous leading lady of the era. He addresses large chunks of dialogue to her gigantic beautiful visage that looms over him from a street-side hoarding for her latest film, \"Dreamy Girl\", oblivious to the snickers of passers-by. Along with his dreams, Om has a mother who believes he can accomplish anything, and a selfless best friend who wants nothing more than for Om to succeed. The filmi Ma and the best buddy are ubiquitous tropes of Indian Cinema, and in the hands of Kirron Kher and Shreyas Talpade, the roles are both spoofed and played straight for poignant dramatic effect.\n\nAs this is the movies, anything can happen, and does. Om finds himself having a close encounter with Shantipriya at the premiere of \"Dreamy Girl\". The next day he is a background-performer in a scene where the hero saves Shantipriya from a blaze. The leading man loses his nerve when the fire goes out of control, and our man Om jumps in to save the day. The two become friends. However before he can profess his love to her, things go horribly wrong, and Om perishes trying to save her life.\n\nThirty years later, we meet a reigning superstar of Hindi cinema, Om Kapoor, with a distinct resemblance to the deceased Om. He is spoilt, obnoxious, and oversexed, everything poor short-lived background-performer Om was not. But once his memory is given a few jolts by some staged studio fires and a visit to a derelict film studio, he realizes he is Om, reborn to avenge past wrongs.\n\nI loved everything about \"Om Shanti Om\". In Farah Khan's previous film, the hit \"Main Hoon Na\", she had passing references to the songs and the look of the seventies. Her new opus, \"Om Shanti Om\" is an unabashedly shrewd and commercial film, but there is no denying that it is a full-blown love letter to the cinema of the seventies. For years, I was ambivalent to Shah Rukh Khan's work, but with \"Main Hoon Na\", \"Paheli\", \"Chak De India\", and even the Karan Johar NRI (Non-Resident Indian) sagas, I have become a big admirer. Success agrees with Shah Rukh Khan, the actor: he seems to try less hard to make an impression, is comfortable in his skin, and so can focus better on the character he is playing. His willingness to laugh at himself makes his screen persona that much more appealing. He is simply wonderful as the two Oms, creating two distinct characters with a single mission.\n\nSpecial mention must be made of suave villain, Arjun Rampal and Deepika Padukone, the new actress who plays the '70's star Shantipriya. With her statuesque beauty and patrician elegance, she recalls Hema Malini in her heyday. In even the cheesiest settings and the most ridiculous costumes and makeup, Ms. Malini\u0097and now Ms. Padukone\u0097would display an innate dignity. Another star of the film is the production design. I loved the gorgeous Art Deco film studio, the film sets, the vibrant color scheme and look of the film. Great care and thought (money, too) have gone into this project, and modern film technology is used seamlessly to render the illusion all the more believable.\n\n\"Om Shanti Om\" is a celebration of fun and the joy of Indian cinema: Farah Khan deservedly has a huge hit on her hands."

Watching this movie at home i was impressed, the lavish colours, beautiful sets and awesome intentional overacting!\n\nThis movie is not meant for Filmfare awards, thats not why it was created. this is a sort of light-hearted black comedy that was created to entertain (even though it received 10 Filmfare award nods) i started watching this during a break from exam revision and ended up watching the whole thing, i just couldn't get enough.\n\nThere are more cameo appearances than one could shake a stick at, and this made the film fun for the young or old, having family members pause the movie and trying to guess who they are is just awesomely well done and sooo captivating from Farah Khan, really brings people together, and ignites the Bollywood in you.\n\nThis movie also introduces Deepika Padukone, and my gosh i could not believe this was her first movie. she was amazing, really lit up the screen when you saw how beautiful she is portraying a 70's heroine. SRK's performance and new appearance are both awesome, as hes allowed to act (and strut) his ass off, of which he does very well, and its understandable why he is crowned King Khan. all i can really say about him is \"Vaah! Kya acting kar raha hai!... Vaah! Kya acting kar raha hai!\"\n\nAll in all this movie is fun, exciting, entertaining and a great laugh. i highly recommend viewing this on Blu-Ray and letting those lush on-screen colours EXPLODE!!"

Who else would have thought that someone could easily take the credit for one of the most famous quotes in Indian cinema? With Farah, everything is possible, she even has Shah Rukh wrapped around her fingers.\n\nThis movie had already made more than 100% profit even before the release of the film, the rights sold to Eros, cost 65 crore, that is a 35 crore profit from a cost of 30 crore, they could have released the movie tickets for free, but then stampedes and over-crowding of Cineplex's would incur loss in civil lawsuits against her and SRK, the producer of the film.\n\nWe see SRK playing a Junior Artist in the late 70s, the settings, and ambiance brings you back to numerous memorable (but also funny bone tickling) moments in the Bollywood industry. For those who have grown up watching those 70s and 80s movies, there are a lot of scenes you'd identify with and also roll on the floor laughing.\n\nNewcomer Deepika is playing Hema Malini-ish heroine in the 70s, even appears with many surprises and familiar faces of that era. Our (junior) hero falls for her only to discover some surprises in the interval, and later is involves in an accident that takes his life.\n\n'Pickar abhi baaki hai, mere dost' as we hear in the promos, the movie is yet to continue. Om is reincarnated, and 30 years later (thankfully, cos seeing SRK play his 20s is no more acceptable) we see him as an arrogant actor born to a famous filmi family (hint\u0085 hint). And from here, with a series of events, (the new) Om regains his memories from his previous life, and is determined to take revenge.\n\nThis doesn't mean the second half is filled with boring dramebazi, in the 2000s we actually we to see more parody and spoof portrayed on the actors of the current era, and many references made to the current situation of Indian cinema\u0085 want to know more, I guess you should catch the movie, cos Farah is a much better story teller than me!"

But that is the way things are with every time there is a Shahrukh Khan release, the entire build up is like a Mega Event and talk of the town.\n\nDoes it live up to the hype? Well... Answer is both -- Yes (if you are looking for pure entertainment), and No (if you are logical and expect every movie do be a godfather or mother India)\n\nFor starters, when i watched this movie (First day First Show). SRK and d\u00e9butant deepika acted well. Other performances were also pretty good. But at the end i got the feeling that there was something in the movie which was amiss. What was it? Was the storyline a drivel.....? Well yes, it was my logical mind cropping up!! Thats the most deadly mistake you can do while watching a Bollywood Masala movie and particularly Om Shanti Om.\n\nHmm.. So I did a retake and watched the movie again, two weeks after its release when all the dust (of hype) had settled down. And it was an immensely enjoyable experience this time. I loved those scenes which I didn't think much first time around, the overacting mother(Kirron Kher), the convincing villain, even the horror twist to the story!\n\nYes Om Shanti Om is a must watch and a great cinematic effort for the following reasons: 1) How wonderfully the era of the 1970's has been re created. truly superb job. the sets, costumes, mannerisms leave you mesmerized and make you want to go and actually live in that era for a day at least! 2) This may not be SRK's best work as an actor.. BUT hats off to him for a spell binding performance. His portrayal of the 70's character, the mannerisms incorporated in acting are simply superb. the reinvention with Six Pack abs is relevant with his YO... \"FISH IT, MIKEY ACT\" in the second half. The King Khan carries the entire film on his shoulders. 3) The funny and light take on the Hindi Movie Industry starting right from the spoofs on legendary actors to the modern era. Its actually a film within film.\n\n4) Natural and heart warming performances by Kirron Kher (90% Moms in India are like that only), Shreyas Talpade and Javed Sheikh (Om's Dad). Stunning debut by deepika!She has oodles of charm. Rampal makes the macho villain.\n\n5)Some fantastic dialogues, the best one being SRK's acceptance speech of the award.\n\n6) great music dished out.\n\nAll in all a film meant to be enjoyed and relished. PRECAUTION: Leave the logical brains out of the Cinema Hall and watch King Khan set the screen on fire..!"

So, if you are in the latter this movie may not \"convert\" you although you may still watch it for its excellent music and tongue-in-cheek humor. But, if you are an SRK fan, then this will be likely up there in your top-3 list of must-see SRK movies. it is a tour de force performance by the Khan as he shines in all departments of histrionics, and effortlessly carries the movie on his shoulders(I believe he is in every scene, not unlike most Kamalahasan movies - his Tamil superstar counterpart) - and whether he is romancing, tearing up, hamming it up or being a comic - he is at the top of his game - this movie likely represents SRK at the peak of his dramatic showmanship skills - especially his skills as a comedic actor - I believe that in the current Bollywood landscape, he is likely the best dramatic & comic actor around, bar none. The wonderful soundtrack , especially the final Broadway-operatic style climax no., as well a bright, young supporting cast does not hurt either. And of course, kudos to Farah Khan as the auteur of an endless entertaining, creative fun film unique among Hindi movies in the mad-magazine-like sense of spoofy comedy which enlivens and charms the whole movie - terrifically entertaining, two thumbs-up. As an SRK movie, it probably rates a 10. I stopped short probably only because at the end of the day it is \"merely\" terrifically entertaining ! A 10 is probably reserved for those magical unforgettable great ones like Sholay, that go beyond mere comic entertainment?"

And i couldn't help comparing the two movies. But then this comment is about OSO so i will restrict myself to that. The title of this comment will tell you what i think of this movie in particular and Bollywood in general.\n\nAgreed that SRK is a brilliant and versatile actor. Agreed that a movie need not be original to be entertaining. But shouldn't a movie have a story? And preferably a script, even if not original? OSO has none. Its a shame that the so called \"power group\" of Bollywood decided to make a movie but couldn't find someone decent enough who can think of a good story and write a decent script. All they could do was get all their friends together, have lots of song and dance sequences, write corny dialogs showing how good they are at spoofing and the result was OSO. It would be better if Farah Khan restricts herself to choreography.\n\nBut then the movie is making good money at the box office.People are calling it an \"enternairer\" and i seem to be the only fool trying to justify why i gave a two to this movie. Movies like OSO have made me stop watching Bollywood movies. But then last week i also saw an unknown movie called \"The Blue Umbrella\" and it reassured me that good cinema can still be expected from Bollywood."

It literally mocks everything including it's own creators. it is a spectacle of many events, a total Bollywood masala all crammed into one movie!! The film both pokes fun at itself and celebrates its unique, inimitable style. It offers everything that bollywood is known for in the world.\n\nIt is the story of \"Om\", \"Shanti\" and bollywood as whole. Om is a junior artist who aspires to be a main lead in a movie someday, he idolises a female star \"Shanti\" and wants to woo her but tragedy hits and everything gets bonkers. The songs in this are beautiful and fun at the same time. It's a Must watch if you are trynna get into bollywood."

I never knew that this movie would end as a horror stuff now..Some positive aspects about the film- Deepika looks good and Arjun Rampal has proved a point. God sake I dint waste my money watching it in a theater. Real waste of time movie. Don't go by the charm. Think twice before watching any Srk movies..as its proving right these days.The Movie was a hit because of Srk and the hype created by media.Sawariya was better than this one.

They both meet with an unfortunate event, and are killed. Thirty years later, Om Kapoor (Shah Rukh Khan) realizes suddenly that he is the first Om reincarnated, and sets a path to avenge the death of Shanti.\n\nComedy and drama combine to make this an entertaining film. In addition, Om Shanti Om, makes gentle fun of itself and Bollywood movies in general, adding another level of fun. Both of Khan's performances are solid, and Padukone (in her debut role) is a confident, convincing actress. The movie is full of Bollywood big names giving special appearances and cameos --well over 50-- giving an added dimension to the movie, as the viewer tries to recognize them all. It contains impressive dance numbers, with mostly good music. Overall, while not perfect, Om Shanti Om is thoroughly enjoyable.\n\n(Other cast members include Bindu in a small role, Kirron Kher as Om Prakash Makhija's mother, Arjun Rampal as Mukesh Mehra, and Shreyas Talpade as Pappu Master.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "SRK and FK are back after MHN with another somewhat spoofy, so-called 'masala' movie. Inspired by Karz, it's a reincarnation movie. The first half depicts the budding love-story whereas the 2nd half is more of a revenge drama.\n\nSRK and co. are quite audacious that the movie is an out and out masala movie (whatever that means) with little or no logic whatsoever. At one point of the movie, a director boasts that he has placed three camera, one from Ray's angle, one from Bimal Roy's and the third from Guru Dutt's angle. The producer quips back to use a Desai angle, that would help the most. Ouch!! But the fact remains that even if you claim that you are deliberately overacting that doesn't help your dismal histrionics, even if you claim that you are copying past movies to pay them 'tribute' that doesn't hide the lack of creativity, even if you take the excuse that bollywood movies generally lack logic that doesn't hide the fact that your movies in certain parts is still illogical. Then there is the much talked about Filmfare award scene. Nicely done but I feel the spoofs coming on TV are at times much better even though they don't have any stars spoofing themselves.\n\nComing to the brighter side of the movie, Deepika Padukone looks great! (though the girl playing Dolly has better cleavage). Special effects are very well done especially the song in which some older movie scenes are seamlessly merged. The music is decent with one or two good songs. And of course there are many-many stars making guest appearances through out the movie.\n\nOn the whole, I would certainly not recommend to spend 200-300 bucks to catch it in a theater. Catch it on a rented DVD or wait for the TV release."

Arjun was an apt choice for the role he played. Deepika looked stunning. Manish Malhotra and Karan Johar have done a good job with the wardrobe.\n\nThe hype for the movie was better than the movie itself. There was no originality in the story. The script, screenplay and the direction is flawed. The dialogues are irritating. The only saving grace of the much hyped movie is the music. Main Agar Kahoon and Dard-e-Disco stand out. the three that i have given as a rating to the movie is 1) for SRK 2) For Deepika 3)The songs. if you are expecting a logical conclusion or a logical explanation to the movie don't expect one because this movie wont offer one. its a masala movie that was made for a one time watch."

She looks very nice as well ! Farah Khan has a really unique style of directing where she seems to entertain the audience throughout the movie , right from the starting credits to the end credits. It surprising to think that the story is based on an old theme like re-birth. They way the movie is made around that theme is really good. And of course, one of the best parts of the movie is when SRK , as a junior artiste , is performing as a South Indian. That was hilarious. Some actors are there for a brief moment as themselves, but they are excellent and funny. e.g Abhishek Bachan , Akshay Kumar. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.

Reviving the 70s era of Indian cinema was quite entertaining and very creatively presented. I must say it made me feel that its going to be a great movie, but despite creativeness and some very well choreographed songs, I must say the 'Reincarnation' idea was not very well presented. Agreed, that the idea in the first place seemed very 'far-fetched', but then a good director can make a lame or that far-fetched idea flow well with the movie, which Farah Khan fails to do so. When compared to her previous work (Main Hoon Na), it is sad that she has not done a great job in story and plot development. However Arjun Rampal does a great job performing in his negative role, Shreyas Talpade did a good supporting actor role, not impressive but good enough, Shahrukh Khan pulls off a near or slightly above average performance (mainly due to some solid acting in some emotional scenes), while the new actress, Deepika Padukone, starts off her career in mediocre acting, but much can be expected out of her in future.\n\nThis movie, If I'm to conclude, was pure 'Masala' (for those who would just love to watch this move for the sake of cheesy and attention seeking songs with loads of guest appearances by celebrities and spiced-up special appearances). Otherwise, as one of the OSO trailers boldly says \"Most entertaining Drama of the year\", ironically it isn't. My rating 5/10"

I usually hate to watch the songs and skip it but surprisingly I watched each and every song of this movie and they were all excellently choreographed. Not only that but it was just fun to watch each and every song, especially the one with so many stars coming in but still all other songs were just as good as that one and also they all were directed to be looked like if I were watching a Broadway musical! It was just mesmerizing! Excellent music! Excellent acting! Excellent direction! Great story! And also there wasn't even a single second in the movie were you think that its getting boring. The sets in the movie are really relaxing to the eyes and it makes you feel not to get off your seat. It was just a very smooth movie and Deepeka Padukone is really hot! I personally think that this movie is also a contender for Top 10 Bollywood movies of all time!"

Otherwise there is no story in the movie at all!!\n\nDoes Farah Khan think that Indian audience have no brains!! May be that's right. But \"Kam se woh to khud thoda dimaag laga leti\".\n\nThere are so many places where even a stupid person will wonder how it is possible - like Arjun Rampal gets up, and there is none in the room - earlier he was roaming with bodyguards. Etc etc. List is endless. I am sure they could have done a better job in coming up with a better story, and could have still remained funny.\n\nKiran Kher as usual irritating. SRK is good, but I think it is high time he starts taking better roles. Shreyas has done justice to his role.\n\nFinal recommendation, don't go and watch the movie - Save time and money."

No one gets bored from beginning till the very end.\n\nOm prakash makhija (Shah Rukh Khan) is a very successful 'junior artist', who inspires to be a hero one day. His best friend Pappu (Shreyas Talpade) supports him by praising his talent and style. Even his mother (Kirron Kher) encouraged him to be a hero by saying 'Tum ek din zaroor hero banega' (You will definitely be a hero one day). Om is madly in love with the super star of that time ShantiPriya (Deepika Padukone) and even meets her one day luckily. But unluckily after learning a secret about hers he lands in trouble.\n\nThe photography is excellent. There are many notable and catchy shots. The art direction is incredible. Lot's of effort was taken in creating the settings especially for the song dhoom Tana. Editing and sound are of notable features. Songs are stupendous. Ajab Si, deewangi, dhoom Tana are exemplary. The performances are good from all actors. Shah Rukh Khan as usual shines in his role. Arjun Rampal, Shreyas Talpade and Kirron kher did well in their respective roles. And Arjun Rampal is a wonderful villain. . The new comer Deepika Padukone is very in all aspects and she deserves all the awards she is getting. The most catchy part of this film is the song sequence deewangi deewangi where thirty one stars appear.\n\nGo watch it!!! all those who likes Shah Rukh and entertaining films will definitely like this.\n\n8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Almost an year back, a similar kinda movie released known as Dhoom 2. It has some striking resemblance with Om Shanti Om. First, the hype. The movies were promoted quite extremely. Second, star cast. Both featured an excellent star cast; enough to pull people to the theaters . Third, Good Music. Both Music Albums were instant hit. Fourth, Silly and Senseless Plot. And Last, Majority liked it and made (making) them blockbusters.\n\nThe major difference is that Dhoom 2 was a crap all the way while Om Shanti Om is a garbage, only in second half. I've to admit that I enjoyed first half well and was expecting something even better in second. But things got so worse in second half that I wanted the movie to end 30 minutes earlier. The climax was so terribly shown that made me question Farah Khan's ability as a movie maker.\n\nI have no problems with the comic filmfare award ceremony and all hilarious stuff. I enjoyed it. The problem was that the scenes that demanded seriousness were also made comical. Now a 2007 actor (Om kapur aka SRK) playing a character like 'Mohabbat man' seems unacceptable. If he's a filmfare award winner superstar how can he play such roles when he later accepts in the film that he chooses his scripts carefully.\n\nThe reincarnation and revenge plots demand seriousness and creativity because you have to make people believe in things that are somewhat unacceptable. But the movie was too focused on 'destiny' that Farah Khan didn't take pain in having a good storyline. Perhaps she is intelligent enough to know that a good story and plot has no takers in Indian cinema. It is the hype and star status that sells.\n\nAnyways, +3/5 for 1st half and -1/5 for the 2nd. This one gets 4/10 from me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although Om Shanti Om is an enjoyable at some levels, I can see why people who don't like Shahrukhkhanisms much might absolutely detest this movie.\n\nAny one who goes to see the movie looking for logic after watching Main Hoon Na, looking at the promos or hearing a bit about the story would be kidding themselves. It does fall apart in the second half I thought... after a bit, Shahrukh Khan, Shahrukh Khan and again Shahrukh Khan in each frame becomes weary.\n\nInstead of becoming a tribute to bollywood, which it could have pulled off, the movie becomes a tribute to Shahrukh Khan by Shahrukh Khan and his friends. For instance, we could have seen other star cast members giving more tributes to more heroes, heroines and villains of bollywood (it did happen like in a few scenes of Padukone and one tributing the villain Ajit) but it was mainly Shahrukh Khan trying to do a flick here, a flash there in an attempt to give a tribute or whatever it was.\n\nAnother aspect was the mishmash between the tribute and the wacky story. The movie tries to do two things and doesn't strike the right balance, the audience can find itself loose attention a lot of times. Farah Khan, despite all this, is an innovative director and the movie has its funny moments too. The Filmfare Awards ceremony where Abhishek Bachchan and Hrithik Roshan appear, acting arrogant was hilarious for instance. I enjoyed the movie in parts but over all, it was ordinary. 5/10."

People can call his one of the worst movie given by King Khan. Much hyped actress Deepika hardly have any role in the movie, may for max 25min in 3hrs movie. Some part of the movie were funny, but not enough for the people to declared it was a hit. There is no link between the Om of 1970's and Om kapoor of 2007. Some part of the movie were really irritating. But songs like Deewangi and Aakho mein tere entertained people for time being. There was no proper conclusion given to the movie. The concept of the movie was taken from blockbuster hit movie KARZ, but it was not worth for it. Advice: People Don't waste your time watching OM SHANTI OM, instead sit at home and have some delightful moment with your family and friends.........cyaaaa"

The movie made me fall in love with movies and also my favourite star ever: SRK.\n\nDeepika has a fantastic debut. She has acted so much better in her future films but she has never looked as good.

But what bothers me is the amt of limelight and buzz this kinda junk gets, just because its an SRK movie! Comedy? Its a script written, prolly mostly on the set, like one of those mindless bollywood based comedy show on any ZeTV or SonyTV.\n\nI think its a horror movie, ya, in fact I am sure its a horror movie!

Hard to believe that this is Deepika Padukone's first movie as she more than holds her own against the inimitable SRK, who is at his absolute finest whether he's being silly, sensitive, or insanely dramatic. Kirron Kher is her usual superb self as the 'filmy ma', and Arjun Rampal smoother than well aged scotch as the archetypal villain. Shreyas Talpade is the real screen stealer though, for his finely nuanced performance as the hero's best friend. I love watching this one when I really want to remind myself that life doesn't have to be serious all the time, and that if things aren't okay as yet, it means 'picture abhi baaki hai mere dost!"

However I will try to keep this review shortish and to the point.\n\nStory wise Om Shanti Om is pretty unique, it deals with reincarnation and the main character being able to remember his previous life. It also to a lesser extent deals with life after death as Shanti is revealed to come back as a ghost. The story will pull you in by Om Prakash's love for Shantipriya, a successful actress and stunning beauty who through a twist of fate he saves from a fire and befriends. Just a beautiful story with romance, suspense, horror, love and betrayal.\n\nCasting wise what can I say besides it's Deepika Padukone and Shah Rukh Khan. Both look absolutely amazing and give jaw dropping performances especially Deepika. You won't be disappointed either by the sheer amount of cameo appearances made by other actors and actresses including Abhishek Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukerji etc.\n\nSong wise Om Shanti Om is filled with amazing musical numbers like the title song Om Shanti Om, Aankon Mein Teri, Dard E, Dhoom Tana, Dastaan E etc.\n\nSo what more can be said besides go watch it, itMs worth the 3hrs of your time and I'm sure you'll absolutely love it like I did. 9/10 from me and here's hoping for a number 2 where he marries Sandy xD."

        "review_detailed_main": "There were few things those have created much hype about the movie such as first it was Shahrukh Khan movie and it is after the success of Chak De India, secondly Farah khan's second movie after Main Hoon Na, thirdly it has new heroine Deepika Padukone, fourth is hoards of star in a song and fifth is very good marketing and Diwali time which was promising a good entertainment. So after all has the movie been succeeded in entertaining the viewer?\n\nNot as expected really. I think the movie is unimpressive remake of the Rishi Kapoor starer \"Karz\". As I have seen both the movie and so I can say that \"Karz\" was much better than \"Om Shanti Om\". There are few reasons for that. Though the movie seems to be good for first time viewer who haven't seen \"Karz\" but in real the movie is lacking good backdrop script of reincarnation. OSO has filmy background story and dull execution of it that turn out to be unimpressive. While \"Karz\" has very good script. Songs of OSO are not good except couple of average tracks while the music and songs of \"Karz\" are melodious.\n\nThe only thing that was not in the \"Karz\" and that is extra surprise in the OSO is hoards of stars dancing in a very good entertaining song. So over all it is an average movie showing typical Bollywood reincarnation story. Though it is quite good movie for first time viewer and good time pass for the masses but not that impressive and failed to impress the people who believe in quality cinema.\n\nOm Shanti Om can not be considered among the Shahrukh khan's best work while Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, Swades and Chak De India can be considered as Shahrukh khan's best work till date.\n\nI can consider it as an average movie and give my rating as 5 out of 10.(5/10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Diwali times in India, time for big budget movies to be released. Producers wait for this time of the year \u0096 Diwali coincides with ID. This year two movies were released \u0096 Sanjay Lila Bhansali's launch pad for two star kids \u0096 Saawariya and Farah Khan's Shah Rukh Khan vehicle \u0096 Om Shanti Om. Luckily OSO was released in Amsterdam and I did not miss that opportunity to go and see the movie.\n\nThe story starts in 1970s - Om Prakash Rakheja (Shah Rukh Khan) a junior artist in Bollywood film industry is madly in love with the dream girl star heroine Shanti Priya (debutant Deepika Padukone). After Om rescues Shanti from blazing fire during a shoot, they get to know each other. But a producer Rakesh Mehra (Arjun Rampal) whose child Shanti is bearing kills Shanti. Om tries to rescue Shanti but he too is killed by Rakesh's goons. But Om's spirit is born again as Om Kapoor (Shah Rukh Khan). In this reincarnation avatar Om is a super star himself and slowly gets to know the mystery of his previous life's killings. To find revenge he finds a girl Sandhya (Deepika again) resembling Shanti Priya to play the ghost to seek out the truth from aging producer Rakesh.\n\nOSO is a light remake of 1970s hit movie Karz. It gives credit of that during the first shot itself by showing the Rishi Kapoor's song Om Shanti Om. The movie is quite over the top \u0096 like Director Farah Khan herself. Too loud, too jazzy, too colorful, too festive in nature \u0096 quite suitable to Indian front bencher's taste.\n\nShah Rukh Khan does his usual antics and succeeds. New girl Deepika is good \u0096 too tall, too slim, everything is long in her \u0096 her fingers, her nails, her legs \u0096 but a good launch pad for Deepika. She has done a good job in acting and looks. Shreyas Talpade as a side kick of Shah Rukh is okay and looks absurd with a weird wig. Arjun Rampal as a villain has acted well and reminds us of 1970s movie bad man like Pran.\n\nThere is overdoes of film actors appearing as guests; the list is long (I read about 30-35) and I would only mention a few that made me notice them \u0096 Dharmendra, Jitendra, Mithunda, Rekha, Abhishek and Akshay Kumar.\n\nA typical Indian masala served during this Diwali may do well at box office. But movie does not have any class or finesse that Farah Khan delivered with her first debut movie Main Hoon Na.\n\nMusic is below average and songs are okay. The whole movie is shot on gaudy sets and to create laughter everyone overacts \u0096 like in old movies. It surely creates a tickle.The best feel good part of the movie when the end titles starts rolling and the whole OSO team is shown walking past the red carpet. If you like nonsense Indian Bollywood movies, this movie is surely for you during this festive season.\n\n(Stars 5.25 out of 10)"

Rather we can say that this is a Farah Khan movie.\n\nThere were some funny moments but that could not be enough for the movie.\n\nThe music of the movie was outstanding. Each and every song of the movie was really awesome."

        "review_detailed_main": "Om Shanti Om is a story based on re-incarnation and without Shahrukh in the lead role the movie would have done mediocre business. Shahrukh's been riding a wave of success and he is no doubt the King of Bollywood actors.\n\nThe first half is set in the 70s and Sharukh (Mr. Makhija) is a struggling junior artist who dreams of making it big. He dies trying to save his favorite actress Shantipriya (played by Ms.Padokone) who is killed by Mukesh Mehra (Arjun Rampal). The second half deals with re-birth, re-discovering the truth and avenging his and Shantipriya's death.\n\nChak De won critical acclaim and people expected Shahrukh to turn out another hit. However, in the absence of a strong star cast (with the exception of Arjun Rampal and Kiron Kher), the camera focuses entirely on King Khan. Shortly after intermission one realizes that the movie is a blatant remake of Karz!\n\nMy friend Pratibha who accompanied me was watching it for the second time and said she was bored stiff. The musical score is good but the songs are a shade too lengthy.\n\nShahrukh's performance is credible and laudable-if one does not leave the theater grumbling after nearly 3 hours, it is solely because of him. Deepika Padukone is average looking and does not have a lot of dialogues to her credit-she'll be better off doing supporting roles or art films. Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay amuse in their cameos.\n\nA must watch for Sharukh Fans - Yes! Wanna watch it again - no way! Remake of Rishi Kapoor-Tina Munim starrer Karz!"

        "review_detailed_main": "OSO has rocked in the box office, but in my opinion, it is not as good as much as it was hyped. The film, though entertaining did not fulfill my expectations. Considering SRK in Chak De!, it is a disappointing performance. Deepika certainly performed well in her debut film. Arjun Rampal and Shreyas Talpade performed brilliantly. Farah Khan's direction is commendable. I feel directing such films are tough, but she has done it beautifully. No doubt that OSO's music is the best in 2007. Vishal-Shekhar's music is too good. Backgrownd score by Sandeep Chowta too is superb. Editing by Shrish Kunder could have been better. In my opinion, SRK's 6 pack abs did the film a world of good. But OSO is certainly not as good as Jab We Met."
