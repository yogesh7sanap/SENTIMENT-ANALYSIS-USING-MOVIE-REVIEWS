But, it very often doesn't have any impact at all like in the case of movies like Dark Waters (Dupont) or Deepwater Horizon (BP) or Love & Other Drugs (Pfizer/Eli Lilly) or The Big Short (Banks) or Thank You For Smoking (Tobacco)... I'd like to think that this film had at least a measurable impact on society and more specifically, the amount of sexual abuse cases in religion... and that in itself, is commendable.\n\nThe film does a good job not only focusing on the main cast of characters, but also spends some time focusing on the sub-supporting characters, like the 'survivors' in the film and spends a good amount of time on the investigative part of the whole story as well... journalism like this didn't just fall out of the sky... it took months and months of hard researching and interviewing many many different people...\n\nThey obviously took some creative license wrt. the events and timeline of certain parts of the film, but overall about 90% of the events shown in the film actually happened. And overall it's a good film and a fantastic docu-movie that should be viewed by all at least once."

        "review_title": "Catholic Church in the Spotlight.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. 'Spotlight's' dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe.\n\nTom McCarthy could not have been at the helm of a better film and what he has been able to achieve in terms of wrestling the attentions of the audience is worthy of the highest praise. McCarthy, along with Josh Singer have written a gritty story that pulls no punches and it isn't afraid to get right into the heart of the required subject. For 'Spotlight' to have been received by the critics as well as it has it had to stride unapologetically into this unbelievable and sordid affair. It needed to expose the sensitive and controversial information that some people may find confronting but in the context of this outstanding production, absolutely essential. It destroyed lives and revealed the blatant arrogance of this pious organisation.\n\nThe all star cast jumps right out at you even before the opening scenes are shot up onto the screen. Based on true events, 'Spotlight' pushes all the right buttons from the beginning. As the name implies, 'Spotlight' refers to the investigative journalism team who report for the Boston Globe newspaper. They are thorough, relentless and will stop at nothing to expose headline stories that affect the everyday lives of normal American's. When the new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), drops a potentially explosive story in the lap of Spotlight chief, Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), about allegations of sexual abuse involving the Catholic Church, Robinson and his loyal crew go about uncovering one of the greatest criminal cover-ups in human history. The deeper their investigation goes the more sadistic and shocking the outcome becomes. Fingers are pointed, people are accused and the list of clergy involved becomes larger and larger. The whole situation ceases to become a Boston problem and grows to a worldwide exposure. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo are part of the investigative team as young committed journalists Sacha Pfeiffer and Mike Rezendes respectively. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Michael Keaton has found his niche in Hollywood as a sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as the tenacious and hard hitting Robinson. The real 'cherry' in the cast is the presence of the magnificent Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian who represents the victims in the whole saga. Tucci adds the class that takes 'Spotlight' to another level with an engrossingly accomplished performance.\n\nThis is the best journalistic drama since 1976's 'All the President's Men'. Tom McCarthy has centred his narrative within the confines of the Boston Globe's newsroom as it should have been. 'Spotlight' doesn't shy away from the true nature of newspaper drama and the audience benefits from such an authentic setting. Top shelf acting from some of the very best young talent sparks the fire that captivates the viewer. Throw in some true icons in Keaton and Tucci and 'Spotlight' has the perfect balance. This film will be classified as the very best in its category and has set a benchmark in terms of confronting realism. Sit back and enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before you consider watching \"Spotlight\", I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn't because I think it's a bad film--it's amazingly good. But it's also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers).\n\nThe story is about not only the discovery of a huge number of pedophile priests in the Boston parish by Boston Globe reporters but the organization's discovery that the problem went all the way to the top. In other words, even the beloved Cardinal Bernard Law KNEW about the many, many victims and yet did nothing to discipline them or restrict their access to more victims. But the film doesn't just talk about so much that we know to be true today but it covers the stop by step process by which the paper began and completed the investigation.\n\nWhy did I give the film a 10...particularly since I almost never give films such high scores? Well, the reason is that the folks making the movie really, really cared about the subject matter and getting it right. Instead of focusing on making money with the film and including the usual glitz and glamour, the filmmakers chose instead to emphasize realism above all else. Normal looking actors (such as Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo) are used...and they make efforts to keep them normal looking. Additionally, the film has a relatively slow and deliberate pace--again as they weren't interested in making a pretty or Hollywoodizing the production. Overall, a great film made greater because the folks making it really, really seemed to care and wanted to get it right...which showed great sensitivity for the subject matter and the victims. Great film!"

Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. \"Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us.\" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, \"You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night.\" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!"

Even if it didn't do much for me, which it did, it would still be appreciated for what it set out to do and would have been applauded for trying.\n\nIt took on a very heavy subject, that is still very much relevant today, and does it in a way that's riveting with a strong emotional core, strong insight that illuminates and tells of stuff that we didn't know (that leaves us shocked and very angry) and not fall into the trap of having too much of things that we knew already. It also never feels mawkish or preachy, traps that it also could have fallen into.\n\nWhile it is a deliberate and relatively slow-paced film, it didn't leave me bored for a second, instead gluing me in with its excellent performances across the board, how it tells its story, it's beautifully balanced screenplay and sheer class. Tom McCarthy's direction has all the class and professionalism that 'Spotlight' needed.\n\nOther strengths are the way it's filmed, it's very atmospheric and evocative in its detail and the cinematography is gritty and ravishing. The music fits beautifully, 'Spotlight's' script and story are engrossing and quietly intelligent and the characters are written compellingly.\n\nActing is excellent across the board. Both Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams give career-best performances worthy of award recognition, particularly Ruffalo. Michael Keaton's performances here and in the previous year's 'Birdman' are his best in years, a very commanding turn. Brian D'Arcy James are up to their level.\n\nOverall, a riveting and brave film that does wonders with a difficult subject matter. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

However, what makes this film is an absolutely genius screenplay that is acted to perfection. This script will rock your world. I am not Catholic. I didn't grow up in a deeply Catholic area, but this film still affected me greatly. Everyone should see this movie for that reason. That is something that you have to see for yourself.\n\nHowever, I'd like to focus a little more on the technical aspects. Beyond the fact that the subject matter is heavy and extremely important to American and world culture, this movie does everything else right. The acting is absolutely phenomenal. This is particularly true for Ruffalo and McAdams. I adore the subtlety with which they both act. It is brilliant. There isn't much more to say.

It came to life ten or fifteen minutes in with the first appearance of Billy Crudup as the trial lawyer Eric Macleish, who gave this film a much-needed jolt of energy.\n\nFortunately, the film does build, and the more the story unfolds, the more gripping it becomes, and seemingly, Tom McCarthy's direction improves, too. The performances are all very good, the writing is solid, and the production design is admirable. I don't see Mark Ruffalo's work as Oscar-worthy, which is not to knock it. I thoroughly appreciate the way the performances are underplayed--a performance cannot be more underplayed than Liev Schreiber's, yet that seems right for a character who never shows his cards. It's easy to imagine an approach that has all the reporters emoting heavily as they come to realize the horror of the situation.\n\nMichael Keaton as Walter Robinson, John Slattery as Ben Bradlee, Billy Crudup as Macleish, Stanley Tucci as Garabidian, Jamey Sheridan as Sullivan, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law are all outstanding, as are others I'm probably forgetting to mention. The minor parts are cast with actors with faces who look like they belong in Boston, such as Rachel McAdams' grandmother or the woman who plays the priest's sister.\n\nThe story is so compelling that I was very glad I had seen it, though a crispness of approach from the beginning, establishing characters from the get-go, would have made the movie even better."

Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of \"what ifs\" came to mind. \"What if\" I went to church every Sunday...\"what if\" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us \"...I am a survivor...\" WOW..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else.\n\nMy disagreement with it likely winning Best Picture aside, there are some very fine filmmaking skills on show here in all departments. Director Tom McCarthy, in only his fifth turn at directing, has been nominated for a Best Directing award. While I don't like the lack of emotion his storytelling brought out in me, he clearly had a vision to tell a story in a certain way, and he got it done. He tells it in a punchy fashion that never allows the audience to drift off. The Best Directing race this year is a tight one with four of the five all being widely in contention. I don't think McCarthy will get the win however, as his film doesn't have the \"X-Factor\" going for it that a lot of the others do. Having said that, any film that wins Best Picture has to get some real credit for its director, so don't completely rule him out if it does indeed win that.\n\nMark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams have also been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards. I have trouble understanding how, to again be frank. Roles based on real life characters always get more attention than others but these two had absolutely nothing to work with in the script. They were almost never given a chance to shine in any scene. Because of this I don't believe either has a chance of winning their respective award. It wasn't a film designed to make actors look good. Having said that, the stand out performance for me was Michael Keaton. He almost won the Best Actor award last year and this year can't even get a nomination. Had his been considered a Supporting Role I'm sure he would have but it was probably considered in that \"in between\" state, which may have hurt him.\n\nThere are a lot of true stories at this year's Acadmey Awards and I think 'Spotlight' is benefiting from being the most interesting story of them all. 'The Big Short' is another case of an interesting true story, however that was told in a very unique and clever way. Interestingly, that is the biggest competition 'Spotlight' will have when the winner is read out on the night. My fingers might just be crossed on the seeing the upset."

The movie lacked the sort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when you know how the story will end. The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends."

McCarthy who did double duty as writer and director deserves acknowledgement. The cast is universally excellent. Ruffalo gives the performance of his career, Keaton is solid as a rock, and McAdams reaps overdue dividends from her decision to broaden her career into non-glamorous roles at a time when the only scripts they were sending her were for Diva parts. Smart lady.\n\nA reviewer is not supposed to interject personal feelings in a review but I will say without apology that I miss films like these -- films that speak for the injustice in society and offer solutions -- and wish there were more of them. It seems that when I was younger there was a lot more interest in doing the right thing merely because it was the right thing. This no longer seems to be the societal meme, and that troubles me.\n\nA must-see.\n\n((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"

        "review_detailed_main": "I liked this film, thought it was a well done solid film. But I am afraid I can't say anything more than that, it is very documentary like which can be it's biggest strength (a very fact driven plot heavy film) or it's biggest weakness (characters feel cold and distant and other than the plot nothing really impresses, also quite bland in the visuals department). However the characters do start to show some life nearing the end of the film but by that time damage is done it can be hard if not impossible for viewers to differentiate between the reporters for nearly one and a half hour of the film, they all suffer from different faces but same objective syndrome and inadequate effort is made to separate one from the another. Also speaking of run-time, this film is a wee bit over two hours long, editing especially in the first half could have made this film a bit crispier. However I did like the accuracy level in the film regarding the cellphones, ads, electronics and the cars used in 2001; a lot of films these days are becoming very careless in this regard. I would compare it to last year's Foxcatcher another fact driven docu-drama film, solidly acted, but nothing special in the direction, editing and cinematography department, I would still recommend it but no way this film deserves a second watch, you can absorb everything there is to get in a single viewing. All in all, a solid well written docu-drama which will have it's time in the \"spotlight\" (pun!) this Oscar season and will become \"oh that movie about pedo priests\" by next year's Oscar season."

        "review_title": "All the Vatican's Men in Outstanding Investigative Journalism Film Revealing the Skeletons in the Boston Archdiocese's Closet",
        "review_detailed_main": "In \"All the President's Men\", young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered a national political scandal when they, through their investigative journalism, revealed the White House under then President Richard Nixon was using campaign funding to finance dirty tricks of political enemies, nicknamed Watergate. In \"Spotlight\", a similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes. Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin \"Marty\" Baron (Leiv Schreiber), Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe called \"Spotlight\" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston Diocese proverbial closet. For many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories.\n\nThe story begins with a quick flash-back to 1976 when a priest is jailed for sexual abusing a minor. The film then cuts to 2001. Marty Baron (Schreiber), a Jewish Floridian, becomes the main editor for the Boston Globe. He meets the different editors and journalists, and learns of work by Spotlight. A Globe column reveals a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, claims Cardinal Law, then Archbishop of Boston, knew Father John Geoghan, a priest within Law's diocese, was sexually abusing children, and the bishop did not bring him to the attention of authorities. Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate further to see whether the claim is true and an isolated incident, or if there is more to the story. The \"seed\" is similar to the break-in of the democratic headquarters at the Watergate Complex which eventually revealed the Nixon White House had been engaging in multiple plots against perceived political enemies.\n\nThe Spotlight team is headed by Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (Keaton), a no-nonsense fair but tough reporter/editor. They agree to Baron's wishes and begin researching deeper to see if there is a larger story. Their first lead is the attorney mentioned in the article, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci). Rezendes (Ruffalo) peruses Garabedian who acted as negotiator between the Boston Archdiocese and victims of Father Geoghan. The reporter wishes the attorney to reveal names of the victims, but at first Garabedian declines. Eventually, Garabedian agrees to contact victims, who are now much older, and ask them if they are willing to speak with Rezendes without revealing their names. Eventually, interviews are set up at the attorney's offices. The question then becomes whether there were other priests who engaged in similar criminal behavior against minors.\n\nOn another front, other members of the team, including Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), begin discovering the unspeakable reality of other victims possibly at the hands of more priests, aside from Geoghan. Then a tip from a former rehabilitation counselor for priests informs the team that, based on statistics, there may be as many as 90 priests involved with sexual abuse of children in the Boston Area alone. The team then appropriates volumes of an American guide book of Roman Catholic priests, published once a year, which lists the whereabouts of every clergyman in the church in terms of dioceses and parishes. The investigators make a startling discovery. Certain names in the book over several years are listed as \"on leave due to illness\", \"on administrative leave\", or other designations of inactivity after only one to three years at a particular parish, leading the team to consider these may be priests who engaged in sexual misconduct with minors. If true, it would place blame not only on Cardinal Law as possibly covering up the church's indiscretions but the entire Roman Catholic Church, all the way to the Vatican.\n\nThis is a stunning film about the power of a small group of urban reporters to uncover wrongdoing by one of the oldest and far-reaching institutions in the world: The Roman Catholic Church. In particular high marks for Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer, and Michael Keaton as Robbie Robinson. So much of the story parallels the Watergate Scandal of several decades earlier. As horrible as the actual victimization of minors by the priests, often boys because they were less likely to \"squeal\" because of the shame, the cover-up by Law was nearly as criminal. Instead of taking the priests to justice, as he should have done, he tried to cover it up by offering settlements to the families, often when the victims were minors. Law and probably other church officials moved the priests to other parishes where they engaged in similar behavior, thus allowing widespread sexual abuse to continue. It was eventually revealed that not only did these sexual predators victimize children in other parts of the country, it was happening internationally."

You know in an instant that this is a journalism movie; die-hards in rolled-up shirtsleeves working all hours to unearth a national scandal. I am an absolute sucker for this.\n\nThe scandal herein is the systemic cover-up of pederasty within the Catholic Church. To that end (even though a lot of the dialogue in this movie is come-from-behind startling), one line in particular jumped out at me: \"They say it's just physical abuse but it's more than that, this was spiritual abuse. You know why I went along with everything? Because priests are supposed to be the good guys.\" This isn't just a story about the crimes committed, but there's also sensitivity towards the victims themselves. I dunno, I just found that line deeply unnerving.\n\nBut when all is said and done, this movie runs on the grueling nuts-and-bolts detective work of investigative journalism; a uniformly excellent cast, great writing and tension that continues to build.\n\nAmazing stuff.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Tackling subject matter like Spotlight does is very difficult to portray on film. You have to accurately tell the story enough to not create outcry while also not relying on the weight of the source material in order to induce emotion. It's difficult, but certainly not impossible and Spotlight did pretty much everything right. The acting from one of the best ensemble casts of the year is phenomenal. Everyone gave such a great performance that no one ended up stealing the spotlight, pun intended. The directing is top notch as Tom McCarthy perfectly weaves between scenes without any wasted screen time.\n\nSpotlight is based on the 'Spotlight investigative team at the Boston Globe and their uncovering of the Massachusetts Catholic sex abuse scandal. I think what I was most impressed with was that it by no means was a catholic hate fest, and it definitely could have been. In fact, several moments throughout the film it is shown that even the Spotlight team made many mistakes during the course of this piece. I really appreciated the way everyone was portrayed.\n\nThe performances are all incredible. I'm sure the film will garner many awards come a few months, but it was the chemistry between the entire group that was most impressive. There isn't really a lead, the whole team should be honored. But if I had to pick, I think Mark Ruffalo deserves the most recognition, in large part due to the writing, but it's his subtly emotional sequences that are most effective.\n\nWhen you think of investigative journalism films, All the President's Men certainly comes to mind for most people, rightfully so. But I think Spotlight may this generation's version of that. There are plenty of moments in which it's obvious is inspired from that film, and they both do a great job at making a film without any action, very interesting. I'd be shocked if this doesn't get nominated for a ton of Oscars and possibly even win best picture. Spotlight is extraordinary.\n\n+Ruffalo\n\n+Ensemble cast\n\n+Tight script\n\n+Meticulous directing\n\n10/10"

He nails it with such sincerity that he left me feeling like I was feeling what he was feeling. I don't know if his role would be considered best actor or best supporting actor-- seems the Academy decides that by a flip of the coin. Michael Keaton does a fantastic job but this time around it's Ruffalo, the best I've seen from him ever, hands down. Rachel McAdam's puts the powerful female character wasted in the utterly confusing True Detective Season Two to better use as another member of the investigative team. And the rest of the cast is nothing short of brilliant and convincing. This is one of those rare movies that can build almost unbearable suspense with not much more than phone calls and note taking. What makes this such a nail biter is just simply how realistic it's all portrayed. You REALLY feel like you're in that newsroom; you REALLY identify with each of the characters and understand what they are going through and the stakes involved. This is one of those gems like Glengary Glenn Ross that will have you on the edge of your seat even though there isn't a single bullet fired, explosion, killing or action sequence whatsoever. Bravo to Spotlight."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Spotlight\" is the investigative team at the Boston Globe newspaper who focus on 'big' issues that they select to pursue - work that can take many months to come to fruition. Headed up by Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton) the rest of his team are Mike (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha (Rachel McAdams) and family man Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). It's 2001 and times they are a changin' at The Globe. New editor Marty Baron (Liev Schrieber) is a workaholic wild duck from Florida with transformation in mind. He sees value in the team pursuing a 'cold' story about a Catholic priest accused of multiple counts of paedophilia, all of which appears to have been quietly 'shushed up' by the church. The investigation progressively uncovers a far more widespread and murkier story that goes on to break as a global scandal for the Catholic church.\n\nThis is an important film given its controversial subject matter. And the acting is all top-notch. Michael Keaton feels extremely comfortable in his role as the investigative journalist, delivering one of the most 'goose-bumpy' lines in the film (as seen in the trailer) - \"Which story do you want us to write - because we're writing one of them\". He must have been disappointed not to receive another Best Actor nomination for this.\n\nMark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams both did get the nod for the Supporting Actor/Actress nominations: Ruffalo's performance in particular is stellar, full of earnest passion. But it has to be said that all of the rest of the cast also more than pull their weight, with Liev Schrieber and John Slattery (as sub-editor Ben Bradlee) being very strong and the ever-reliable Stanley Tucci electrifying the screen as the dilligent but cranky lawyer Garabedian. As I write this, the Screen Actors Guild has just awarded \"Spotlight\" the award for the Best Ensemble Cast, and this is well deserved.\n\nThe film looks great, with cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi (\"The Grey\", \"Silver Linings Playbook\") supported by fantastic lighting and superb editing (also Oscar nominated). It's refreshing that the location filming in Boston doesn't lean on the more 'touristy' shots normally depicted. The persistent and effective piano score is by Howard (\"LOTR\") Shore.\n\nSo, with all this going for it, I'm heading for a 10-star rating then? Well, actually, no. There is something distinctly missing in the film that was initially difficult to put my finger on. The film bears closest comparison with 1976's Redford/Hoffman classic \"All The President's Men\". And whilst it does compare in some ways (a lot of indecipherable dialogue and a mass of different names being one!) there's a key ingredient missing. While both stories were true, and you KNEW what the outcome was, \"All The President's Men\" still managed to build up an incredible sense of tension of the \"will they, won't they\" kind that is almost completely missing here. Not that there isn't the opportunity: for example, will delays (caused by certain other newsworthy events happening in September of that year) allow \"The Herald\" to break the story first? But no, the opportunity is squandered. A significant twist in the story (not spoiled here) around Keaton's character is also let off like a damp squib on a rainy night. And where was the scene of 'reaction' from the church, led by Boston's Cardinal Law (Len Cariou)?\n\nSo the two Oscar nominations I would most have issues with are Best Director (for actor/director Tom McCarthy) and Best Picture: undeniably it's a good film, and you should go and see it, but in my eyes it was an opportunity missed - - it should have been an absolute classic.\n\n(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

        "review_detailed_main": "Seconds after the credits for Tom McCarthy's \"Spotlight\" roll, an overwhelming feeling of changing your career takes over. Is film criticism really where I belong? What important, life-changing story am I not writing about? Truth is, quite a bit of classic films give off that same feeling. \"Rocky\" made a bunch of our fathers and older brothers go for a morning run and drink raw eggs. \"Rudy\" made us want to go out and play Notre Dame football. \"Spotlight\" makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions. Honestly speaking, \"Spotlight\" is the best investigative news drama this century. Matter of fact, behind \"All the President's Men\" and maybe \"The Insider,\" it's among the best ever made.\n\n\"Spotlight\" tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.\n\nWhere you must begin, with any praise for the film, is the audacious and fortifying script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. The two create cinematic magic in their articulation of words, characters, and narrative storytelling. Each person feels authentic. Each scene feels rich and equally important as the last. And most of all, its the tightest, most satisfying film from beginning to end, seen this year. From minute one, you're hooked, up until the last second, where they decide the last words spoken should be, \"Spotlight\" is astonishingly crafted.\n\nI'm still in shock and awe that Tom McCarthy is the one who made this. This is a writer/director who I've appreciated but didn't have the \"love\" factor surrounding any of his films. Paired with an outstanding cast, co-writer Josh Singer, editor Tom McArdle, cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and composer Howard Shore, Tom McCarthy gets a chance to create his masterpiece\u0085and succeeds. He makes brilliant artistic choices, such as letting a Mark Ruffalo letter reading play over a 2-minute taxi car ride back to the newspaper. McCarthy's direction is one of the best directorial efforts from any filmmaker this year thus far.\n\nAll the players performing are top-notch but walking away, best-in- show, is the performance of Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo exhibits his best screen performance to date, and makes a stake in his claim for the Oscar this year. Weirdly reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's work in \"The Master,\" Ruffalo builds his 'Mike' from the feet up, giving him his own characteristics that I'm not sure McCarthy and Singer set out to do. His expressions in words, mannerisms, all encapsulate the magnitude of his work, bookended by an explosive scene that brought tears to my eyes. Think back to Emma Stone's acclaimed work in \"Birdman,\" and the scene that made everyone notice. I wanted to simply applaud.\n\nMichael Keaton and Rachel McAdams, who play \"Robbie\" and \"Sacha\" respectively, are attune with their characters and destinations. Each bring strong sensibilities and sensitivity to their roles that desperately call for them. Hotly worked into the story is Liev Schreiber as a newly appointed Editor, that in the little screen time he's given, makes a long-lasting impression. Stanley Tucci is also afforded the same opportunity, and gives one of the film's best monologues.\n\nIf there's a film this year that feels like an Oscar-winner, \"Spotlight\" sure does make a compelling case. Dramatic, heart- pounding, and necessarily made. It's one of the most important films this year and probably THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR. The Telluride tradition may continue."

The Oscars have taken onboard movies with an indie feel over the last few years and with SPOTLIGHT we have a double whammy of a film based on true life events this time featuring The Boston Globe investigation in to child sex abuse and the resulting cover over decades in Boston , Get these prizes out now\n\nOr on second thoughts put them away for the time being because SPOTLIGHT is something of a disappointment . Not so much a disappointment a film that doesn't really do anything radical in its sub-genre. Investigative journalism movies all suffer from the same structural problems along these lines:\n\nJournalist A gets hold of a possible lead , gets pulled in to the editors office and is told \"We can't run this\"\n\nJournalist B gets another lead on the same story , gets pulled into the editors office and is told by the editor \"We can't run this\" Journalist A and B work behind the editors back on the story and cut through every red tape obstacle in their path\n\nJournalist c gets another lead on the same story ... you can see where this is heading can't you ? One thing the film does do well is explain to a secular audience the type of metaphysical power a Catholic priest has over a congregation but apart from that the rest of the film is curiously uninvolving and distant and one wonders if the acclaim it is receiving might be down to the subject matter rather than its cinematic credentials\n\nAs it stands SPOTLIGHT is yet another slightly unsatisfying film expected to win prestigious prizes . There's no doubt in my mind that the 2016 Oscars will be dominated by THE REVENANT . As with every year there's always a film at the ceremony that ends up close but no cigar where it gets several noms but no Oscar in any category . I think SPOTLIGHT or STEVE JOBS might have that dubious distinction next year\n\nUpdate March 2016 . The academy got it wrong again"

It's a perfectly good movie about investigative journalism, and it's interesting to see the process of journalists, but it's extremely pedestrian filmmaking and has like zero insight into the subject at hand (which is the cover-up of priest molestations). Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James play the Spotlight team at the Boston Globe. They're all good, but, except for one big moment with Ruffalo, none of them do anything exceptional. The Globe's new editor, Liev Schreiber (somewhat more interesting, but not much), decides to follow-up on some earlier stories about the subject he thinks are incomplete. The best performance in the film belongs to Stanley Tucci, who plays a lawyer for victims. The second best belongs to Neal Huff as the leader of a victims' organization. Both Huff and Tucci are angry that the Globe is just now getting interested in the story. I think even critics in Boston know that Mad Max: Fury Road is a better film than this. Maybe some day the Spotlight team can uncover that conspiracy."

She, Lombardi, and the Phoenix did the dirty work and the Globe took the credit and is still taking the credit. The rumor, at the time, was that the Globe was bullied by the church into denying that any of the stories published by the Phoenix were true. The Globe became complicit in helping the church keep the story as quiet as possible. This movie is based on a gross misrepresentation of the facts and is being sold on television shows like 'Charlie Rose' as a monument to the Globe's courage and capability in investigative journalism."

In this day of digital news, this movie makes us stand back and realize what we may lose in the way of investigative journalism as we slowly kill off print media.\n\nThe lengths the directors go to to achieve a sense of authenticity is remarkable. We are there in Boston in 2001-2002. We get to know enough about each character to make him or her real, but not enough to create side dramas. The focus remains the child abuse scandal in the archdiocese in Boston. That reflects the conflict the characters face and deal with when events make them rethink the focus of their article.\n\nThe movie is riveting, though we know the outcome."

        "review_title": "Impeccably written and crafted, Spotlight is a first class drama and a standout for 2015.",
        "review_detailed_main": "If I am allowed just five words to describe Spotlight, those words would be Stellar, Scandalous, Stupendous, Spectacular and Sensational. But even these words can't afford enough praise for a visceral film about honest and instinctive journalists devoted to pursuing truth in the interest of justice.\n\nThese journalists are a crack team of investigative reporters assigned to the titular arm of the Boston Globe. Led by Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), with newshounds Michael Rezendez (Mark Ruffalo) and Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), the team goes to work when new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) suggests a closer look at sexual abuse allegations in Boston's predominantly Irish-catholic population. Through exhaustive interviews and investigations, the Spotlight team goes from isolating \"bad apple\" priests in Boston, to indifference in the Massachusetts law enforcement and all the way up to the Vatican. What the team finds is not only the biggest cover-up by the Catholic Church but equally shocking is the fact that documents proving the cover-up existed all along while no one did anything about it. And even worse is the revelation of not just a flaw in the system, but a \"phenomenon\" all over the world.\n\nBased on actual events in 2001, co-writer and director Tom McCarthy exerts restrained precision on how this original story is told. Although rated 18+, McCarthy avoids visual reenactment of these abuses but still brings out the pain and trauma of victims through interviews with the team. Just hearing their ordeal is as gut-wrenching as having to see the act. They are now adults, but when they describe what was done to them, they cry like babies, like when you take something away from a baby. One extraordinary scene has Sacha interviewing a retired priest. You can almost feel the lump in her throat when she asks him if he ever molested a child. The smiling priest casually replies that he \"fooled around a bit\" before disclosing that he himself was raped as a child by another priest. Another scene has a juvenile choir singing Silent Night. Almost instinctively, you wonder if those kids have been touched. McCarthy has a few of these chilling moments to reiterate just how important this film is, but keeps it simple to follow despite a blistering pace.\n\nFrom cluttered newsroom desks to locations around Boston, Spotlight feels highly authentic in narration, detail and performance. At a time when major newspapers were on the decline, the film captures the anxiety of these reporters, their fear of being made redundant by the internet boom, competition from other newspapers, hence why they must remain the best at what they do. As an example of detail, McCarthy even uses the 9/11 attacks as an event that threatens to shut down the Church scandal, but the team's focus remains undeterred. And so do the ensemble cast. Keaton, especially after his comeback in last year's Birdman, is definitely here to stay. But it is Ruffalo that takes center stage as a relentless and inquisitive reporter married to the job. From hustling his way between courthouses and lawyers for and against Spotlight (Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup) and accessing restricted information, Ruffalo is at his outstanding best. There's another great scene when his character flares up in frustration. For a second I thought he would rip through his clothes and turn into an angry green giant.\n\nCasting and delivery, along with an intelligent and impeccably written story makes Spotlight a standout for 2015 and a first class film at that. Altogether, it's a good old fashioned drama celebrating good old fashioned journalism. Just as gallant as the pursuit of truth, the film too ends up pure and absolute. And the five words I used to describe this film? I'd also trade them for a Star each."

It's not boring at all and it's not afraid to go into details, it's very realistic and sometimes it even feels like you are watching something real happen. This did happen and at some parts you really feel like you are watching that and not the movie and also some parts are really messed up. It's never shown, bit you are shocked just by characters talking about it which is great.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Spotlight\" is the best film of 2015 and I will be disappointed if it does not receive the Academy Award for Best Picture. As good as it is, it is just one step short of greatness.\n\n\"Spotlight\" depicts Boston Globe reporters investigating priest sex abuse of children. \"Spotlight\" focuses like a laser on what it is to be a journalist, to consider whether or not to cover a story, to select it, to research it, to uncover piece-by-piece, a full narrative, to publish it and to live with the consequences of publication.\n\nYou don't learn about the reporter's personal lives except for what you see incidentally as they work at home. There is no romantic subplot; there are no trumped-up action scenes where a reporter punches a priest. There's actually one of those scenes, no doubt a self- conscious salute to classic newspaper films, where you see newspapers being run through one of those giant machines that rapidly prints, folds, and stacks hard copies.\n\nI've never seen a film in which I liked these actors more: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian D'Arcy James, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Len Cariou. Lesser known actors in minor roles are every bit as good. There is no Hollywood in these performances. There's no sexy costumes or makeup, no grandstanding for the Academy. The actors are dressed in the workaday attire of newspapermen and women. Much of the film takes place in a grubby shared office full of sloppy manila file folders or in cafes and working class neighborhoods where informants are interviewed. Each performer plays a cog in a giant wheel working to uncover evil. None of them knows about world-shaking scandal still to come, or Pulitzer Prizes. They are just, with a pair of tweezers, turning over one leaf and seeing what lies beneath and adding that to the information already gathered. Even though viewers already know how this story played out in real life, the audience gasps when a discovery is made; the audience fears that a rock will be thrown through a window; the audience fears that judicial complicity will keep the story hidden. I began crying half an hour into the film. I was crying at the end. I made audible \"Huh!\" noises at especially and outrageously ironic moments, as did others in the audience. We applauded at the film's conclusion.\n\nThe film opens with a child in a police station, accompanied by his parents and a priest. A lawyer enters. Everyone speaks in hushed tones. \"I promise this will never happen again.\" The police are cynical. The lawyer is smooth. The child is crushed. The parents are heartbroken. The priest appears slickly demonic. The scene is anonymous. Events like this were repeated at least a thousand times.\n\nJuly, 2001. The Boston Globe acquires its first Jewish editor, Martin Baron. The Spotlight team is considering following up a case of priestly sex abuse. Slowly but surely, they discover that there are far more incidences than suspected. They discover not just one bad apple here and there. Rather, Cardinal Law has reassigned abusive priests to new parishes. Baron meets with Law. Law presents Baron with a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.\n\n\"Spotlight\" mentions \"Good Germans\" \u2013 people who kept their eyes closed to the disappearance of their Jewish neighbors, and the sudden appearance of ash falling from the sky. Just so, there were many \"Good Bostonians.\" It's sickening to confront the many who had awareness of priestly sex abuse and did nothing. Targeted kids were powerless and without allies. One had a schizophrenic mother. Some had absentee fathers. Some were gay. Many were from the wrong side of the tracks. After they were abused, some became alcoholics, drug addicts, or suicides. When SNAP activist Phil Saviano is invited to the Boston Globe's office, and he talks about a conspiracy to protect abusive priests that stretches all the way to the Vatican, he comes across as a twitchy, obnoxious, conspiracy theorist raving about Area 51 \u2013 someone easy to write off.\n\nThe most nauseating reason of all given for ignoring clergy sex abuse: money. The Globe could have covered clergy sex abuse earlier, but it didn't. Over fifty percent of the paper's subscribers are Catholics. Boston is a small town, with a lot of insular Irish Catholics who don't want anyone rocking the boat, or risking various money streams, including the church's significant charity work.\n\nEspecially poignant are the scenes where abuse survivors are encouraged to detail what happened to them. \"It's not enough to say he molested you. You must give me the clinical details of exactly what happened,\" reporters insist, to sobbing survivors, who must then re- inhabit their worst memories.\n\nThe plot churns forward with the single line of a freight train running on schedule. I was never bored.\n\nThe priestly sex abuse crisis is not a tragedy because the Catholic Church is corrupt. The priestly sex abuse crisis is a tragedy because the Catholic Church is great. The film could have become better than it is had it included this theme. Show Catholics feeding the homeless. Show Catholics recovering from grief with the support of their faith. Show Cardinal Law for what he once was \u2013 a courageous hero in the Civil Rights movement, when that meant receiving death threats and alienating the powerful. That something so beautiful is so sullied, along with individual victims' pain, is the heart of this tragedy.\n\nI am a lifelong, church-going Catholic. I present my reasons for being Catholic, in spite of everything, in my book \"Save Send Delete.\" I salute, not boycott, the Globe's reporting, and films like this. Confession and redemption are gifts we shared with the world."

Just scene after scene of people in varying states of agitation either reading or speaking. Compare this to a movie like Steve Jobs (2015) which is also very dialogue heavy and note all the various ways in which Boyle and crew aid their dialogue through camera movement, interesting angles and shadowing, etc. It makes you realize how thoroughly uninteresting Spotlight is in that particular way.

I had only recently seen All the President's Men and had high expectation for this movie if it was true that it was just as good. I'm ecstatic to report that this movie not only lived up to the hype, but exceeded it to emerge as one of the year's best films.\n\nSpotlight was built to stand the test of time with its true to life, edge-of-you-seat style drama. The story follows the journalists in the Spotlight department of the Boston Globe who broke the story about the molestation charges against Priests that had gone on unnoticed for some time. The story itself is engaging to start with but the screenplay, direction, and acting all come together flawlessly to create an incredibly powerful and emotional film. By the time the end credits roll, the film has landed such a powerful and lingering punch that the events portrayed almost seem surreal. This is most definitely a film that will not be forgotten soon.\n\nThe acting is top-notch with everyone from Michael Keaton to Mark Ruffalo to Rachel McAdams giving possibly the performances of their careers, respectively. This is one of the best ensembles of the year. Even those who didn't have as much screen-time like Liev Schriber, Stanler Tucci, and John Slattery shine when their time is given.\n\nOverall, Spotlight is an exceptional film that will most likely receive some major nominations come awards season. The leading and supporting cast all bring their A games as well as director Tom McCarthy. This is a movie you most definitely do not want to miss.\n\n\"It takes a village to raise them. It takes a village to abuse them. That's the truth of it.\""

The film focuses in on the beginnings of these cases, going back to 1976, and depicts the investigative research and reporting that finally exposed these heinous crimes.\n\n\ufffcWe immediately are drawn to a group of top-notch columnists at the Boston Globe as they begin to follow some leads and theories into certain alleged acts that have been overlooked by many parishioners and various institutions throughout the city, including the newspaper itself. The film is a riveting behind-the-scenes look at this story and it thoroughly captures the ennui and the sense of passion and discovery that goes into the job of a reporter brilliantly, with its subtle touches of paper-shrouded desktops and tight cubicles littered with post-notes and family photographs.\n\n\ufffcBased on the true events, the film is interested in reporting the facts of the long research- extensive process and its impact on the investigative team called Spotlight, a team that will later go on to win a Pulitzer Prize for its expos\u00e9. The acting is wonderful, one of the strongest ensembles this year. Mark Ruffalo plays the overworked lead reporter, Michael Rezendes, and he shows the characters' inner strength and stamina with a performance that understates the horror he sees as he talks to the various victims and fights for their cause. Rachel McAdams delivers one of her finest roles as Sacha Pfeiffer, a lapse Catholic. Her scene where she interviews a suspected priest is particularly memorable in its matter-of-fact conversation. Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll, the third reporter on the team, brings the physical outrage front and center. Adding yeoman-like support are Liev Schreiber and John Slattery as the editors who helped to break the story, and Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian, an obsessed lawyer fighting for his young clients' rights. All are splendid, as are Jamey Sheridan, Billy Crudup, Neil Huff, and Len Cariou as the unethical Cardinal Law.\n\n\ufffcBut it is Micheal Keaton who is the standout in his supporting turn as Walter \"Robby\" Robinson, the chief editor of the Spotlight team. The actor layers his character with an underlining grace and intelligence. He interprets this role by playing Robby as a soft-spoken observer and hardened professional and it is such a nuanced and completely believable performance. The character leads the team on its steady course amid subtle threats and allegations and Keaton leads and centers the other actors around his straightforward portrayal. One hopes that his work he will not go unnoticed during award season.\n\n\ufffcThe director, who also wrote the screenplay along with Josh Singer, uses his narrative skills masterfully. The film relies heavily on its insightful dialog and well-defined characters. Much of the film is talk with very little action, but the story itself is thoroughly engrossing. McCarthy also uses strong imagery to reinforce his film, with scenes of the massive Catholic churches dwarfing and overshadowing the smaller houses and playgrounds within the city to maximum effect (Kudos to Masanobu Takayanagi's cinematography, Howard Shore's non-intrusive music score, and Tom McArdle's effective editing.)\n\n\ufffcThe film shies away from lurid details and is, at times, too restrained than needed. It sidesteps any real melodrama and resists the urge to manipulate its audience and toy with their emotions. Rather, it fully encompasses the scandal in a by-the book approach to its subject, a clinical remote approach, and lets the moviegoer learn more and more about the cases as the evidence is slowly revealed. In fact, the only emotional tirade comes from the lead reporter only once in the film, literally about the sins of the Fathers. There is no other hysterical outbursts or angry speeches, no sound and fury in telling this tale, just an objective and powerful retelling of the awful truth that we normally try to avoid.\n\n\ufffcSpotlight uncovers the truths and tells its story in a honest and gripping way. It's just the facts you see up there on the screen, no matter how ugly the truth may be. Go see this film, it's one of the year's best.\n\nVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com\n\nANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

Many of my friends have been touting it. It takes a truly skilled director and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something where they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold of the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director comes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest misconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who are unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is there. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of sensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and uses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as anything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have weaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This plays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense. Loved this."

The city of Boston was torn apart by the scandal that had lasted for decades, and according the film, many people worked to shield the Church from the consequences of the scandal. Without the cover-up, the scandal would not have lasted so long.\n\nHowever well done and easy to follow the story was, it was predictable. Few revelations were made for me. Certainly, it is an important story to tell, and I am glad I saw the film. However, none of the characters lived up to the power of story itself and the actors adding little to its telling. This may be the case of too much story, too little screen time. The film attempted in a couple of cases to make the suffering of the survivors real, but it played like an episode of \"Law and Order: Special Victims Unit\" and not like a feature film. It was too small for such a lofty topic.\n\nIn the film, they often mentioned that people died, but it seemed unreal. Examples of that were need to bring it home. The film covered too much time without making the connections for the audience. I really want to like this film more, but it fails as cinema in too many ways. It would have made a better Lifetime Channel Drama as it was written. Rating: Matin\u00e9e\n\n\"Spotlight\" is good but not great. After a while, Mark Ruffalo's (playing lead reporter Mike Rezendez) pained expression wears thin. Does he have any other look? Not much in this film. Stanley Tucci puts in a good turn as a lawyer working with the survivors, but the rest of the cast is pedestrian. Perhaps it was the writing, but the film and characters didn't greatly impact me despite the best intentions of the filmmakers and the tragedy of the true story.\n\nPeace,\n\nTex Shelters"

How finding out the truth and exposing it was crucial to bringing hard to grasp facts to the focus of the entire world. I see Oscar winners written all over this picture. Best Picture right on to Best Male Actor \u2013 and two of them should be nominated here, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton. Terrific performances by both. This movie moves right along, bringing it all together in a way that almost numbs your mind by the time it's done. When the end credits roll and it shows how this single story brought out atrocious child molestation scandals, not only in America, but all over the world, and you see the long, long list of places, you can hardly manage to get up from your seat and walk out into the world. You are stunned. This is not a spoiler, but I have to say, at one point in this film, without a word spoken, you watch the camera scroll down pages of names and facts, and in the background you hear a chorus of innocent young voices singing a Christmas carol, the hair on the back of your neck rises\u0085.you KNOW you are watching something brilliant. And that's what this production is, brilliant. Without question one of the best pictures you will ever see. And the one that will have you thinking and talking about it for a long, long time after."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you set aside the fact that these things did happen , and the political side of the film which is indeed a pretty heroic attack on the Church , a real punch from the Film industry to the Batican --- as a film experience it is mediocre. It's \"All the presidents Men\" -- but for the church instead of Watergate. The structure of the film is standard , it is clich\u00e9... Reporters making phone calls , trying to contact victims and informants. Offices and dusty files library.\n\nWe have seen MANY films with the same exact pattern. The direction is typical , maybe the director thought the story is so damn big that he shouldn't emphasize on innovative direction and camera skills.\n\nAs a film , it lacks essential stuff which keeps it from being a good one. No love story , not that great characters in general , the movie is only about the church scandal and everything else is low profile.\n\nI'm not putting down the actors who did a decent job ,and I like how Michael Keaton has gotten serious because I like to see this actor. I am a big Inarritu fan and enjoyed \" Birdman \" a lot.\n\nThe Batman ( 1989) is a damn fine film and in my eyes the best Batman. -- in \"Spotlight\" he played with confidence and great skill this reporter fella. But I don't know this reporter and I didn't get to care about him. This goes same for the rest of the team.\n\nLiev Schreiber was a great casting choice. He fits right on the spot of the role he's playing.\n\nThe thing about this movie is the story , the script isn't really strong. It rests too much on the impact of the subject matter and it minimizes all other aspects.\n\nMaybe if it was the first movie about investigative journalism and such ,then it would be OK. I doubt it though , and it is not the first film.\n\nTo name some ,\"Mystic River\" has the attributes of a fine film , dealing somewhat with child molestation and its outcomes. \"Happiness\" ( Solonz ) as well. \" Seven \" is a great film dealing with investigation , libraries , research and such --yes different genres -- but in the end they are good movies.\n\n\"Spotlight\" is mediocre as an experience,for the average movie goer. The only people who may be tricked in calling this a \" masterpiece\" are the people directly involved with the historical happenings in it.\n\np.s- I'm not a catholic and I don't care one bit about the Church. I'm not putting the film down because it hurts the church. I'm putting it down because it isn't anything new or special , objectively as a film experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite its imposing title, Spotlight is an understated movie with a methodical approach that slowly gains momentum. It clearly, confidently shows us how our most precious resource, our children, have been damaged by abuse from catholic priests. This abuse has been prevalent mostly in the United States, but it has occurred wherever there is catholicism, and the church has systematically turned a blind eye to the proceedings. Some children have been driven to suicide by this abuse.\n\nIn 2001 The Boston Globe decided to investigate one priest said to be abusing a large number of children, and the ensuing investigation reveals a huge cover up, with the catholic church using its power to frighten away the globe, and lawyers refusing to reveal important knowledge, and most importantly, an ex priest who rehabilitates abused children refusing to speak to the press.\n\nThe Globe realises that they are handling one of the most important stories in the history of the newspaper, and their pursuit becomes relentless, leading to a shattering conclusion.\n\nThis film scooped best picture at the Oscars and it bears all the hallmarks of the ultimate winner: absolute honesty and integrity in its subject matter, a complicated story simply told and beautifully acted by its committed team of actors. Most of the Spotlight team were catholics by birth and clearly this aided the process, the same applied to the actors, with Ruffalo particularly impressive as a reporter of Portuguese stock. I also liked Stanley Tucci as a lawyer who had dealt with many of the abused children, who was at first reluctant to deal with the Globe, but is won over by their commitment to the story.\n\nAbuse of one kind or another is a daily story in the newspapers these days, when it happened on this scale in a church it is even more shocking. This film lays out the facts in the most humane way possible, and everyone involved deserves credit for this. This really is a film that surely must give some comfort to the families that suffered because of this wicked abuse.\n\nMary Gumsley"

I'm not very sure at which part I stopped watching (and which parts I missed) but from what I saw, the progression of the film seemed to take a while. Also, because it dealt with an industry I don't know much about, most of the technical talk went over my head.\n\nI mean it's great that they're bringing this story to light, but I was not following along that well. The cast did a good job at playing their characters though, and it was great to see A-list actors playing characters outside their typical roles. As well, the mise-en-scene did well in setting the atmosphere of the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight is based on the true story of a Boston Globe editorial team's efforts to uncover systematic child abuse and abuser protection by the Catholic Church. Hardly fresh news, and a topic that will raise strong emotional reactions, and rightly so. But how does it hold up?\n\nGiven the weird emotional volatility surrounding this one, allow me to qualify this review (and its writer): the scandal revisited here is unarguably heinous, as are the many people who took part in perpetuating it. My own feelings about organized religion mean I was only mildly surprised, but then perhaps the subject of the clergy's hypocrisy is worth revisiting, as it has been in entertainment since Moliere's Tartuffe. But this is a film website, the medium is narrative film, and so Spotlight should - and shall, in the longer term - be judged.\n\nThis is a film that owes its success and Oscar nominations to its topic and, to a lesser extent, to its ensemble cast. It is also a throw-back to harder-nosed journalism-based films like All The President's Men - a much better, less self-righteous film. The end result however is a bit awkward: first, the structure is wobbly, throwing us in headfirst and assuming perhaps too much familiarity with the events. The character introductions are very rushed, which means it takes more time to build empathy, especially when it comes to the victims. The climax, such as it is, and ensuing denouement are a bit limp culminating in the obligatory white text on black background to tell you succinctly with words what the filmmakers could not achieve with visuals. It makes you wish, as many reviewers have, that this were a documentary.\n\nThe cast are uniformly good, with Stanley Tucci and Mark Buffalo the stand-outs, but these are solid, seasoned turns, nothing that cries out \"best performance of the year\". Technical credits are closer to a TV-movie than a major Hollywood release.\n\nI can't give it credit merely for tackling an easy target from such a safe distance, but I would concede more points if it told its story more fluidly and dared to explore some of the more dangerous angles a bit more, such as police collusion, or that one memorable scene where a guilty priest rationalizes what he did in a way that hints at even worse events. Sadly, this chooses to play things way too safe."

        "review_title": "Faith",
        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. Faith. A word that easily could have been the title of this gripping and heart-wrenching film. Faith can be defined as trust and belief. Faith can also be defined as religion and ideology. Few things are more devastating than broken faith \u0085 the core of this \"based on actual events\" story of The Boston Globe's exposure of rampant child molestation by dozens of Catholic priests, and the systematic cover-up by \"The Church\".\n\nIt's challenging to name a movie that is as well-made as this one, while also being as difficult to watch. We know the story \u0085 we even know how it snow-balled globally \u0085 but the raw emotions of disgust and sheer anger permeate much of our being as we watch it unfold on screen. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, The Visitor) co-wrote the script with Josh Singer (The Fifth Estate) and it's worthy of favorable comparison to other investigative newspaper films like The Insider (1999), Zodiac (2007), and even the granddaddy of them all \u0085 All The President's Men (1976).\n\nThe opening scene takes place in a 1976 Boston police station. A priest has been accused of molesting a child. Within a couple of minutes we witness the empty promises, the intimidation, and the cover up. So much is conveyed in this brief opener, not the least of which comes courtesy of the ambivalence of the veteran cop as he shrugs it off as 'just another day' in front of an idealistic rookie cop. This is accompanied by Howard Shore's spot-on score, with the best parts featuring only a piano and bass.\n\nFlash forward to 2001 as we meet the investigative journalist team called \"Spotlight\". It's led by editor Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his three reporters: Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They report to Ben Bradlee Jr (John Slattery), whose father was the editor of The Washington Post during the Woodward/Bernstein/Watergate era. New to The Globe is managing editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber). Unlike the others, Mr. Baron is neither a Boston local nor a Catholic. In fact, we catch him reading Dan Shaughnessy's book \"The Curse of the Bambino\", just so he can get a better feel for the community and its people.\n\nWhat is most fascinating about the movie is that it focuses on the investigative aspects \u2013 just how diligent the reporters were in putting the story together \u2013 and how fluid the process was \u0085 the story led them, not vice versa. There was no media agenda to \"get\" the church. Instead, the reporters experienced natural shock as each piece of the puzzle was discovered. One of their key sources was a priest-turned-psychologist (voiced by Richard Jenkins) who helped them put scope to the numbers. Another was Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), the leader of a victim's group, who had tried before to provide documentation to the press. Saviano is the perfect example of how someone so passionate about a cause can be viewed with such skepticism \u0085 right up to the point when they are proved correct. Three attorneys add perspective to the cover-up. Eric Macleish (Billy Crudup) made a career of settling cases (and silencing victims) for the church. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) is the polar opposite \u2013 he fights vigorously to get the victims heard, while Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan) is caught in the middle \u2013 settling cases for the church and struggling with his conscience. Other interesting characters include Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, a smooth-talking power-broker for the church, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law \u2013 the man at the top who eventually apologized and was rewarded with a high-ranking position at The Vatican.\n\nThe film is so well crafted and acted that it features more than a few \"best scenes\". Sacha has a brief encounter with a former priest on his front door stoop. The priest freely admits to molesting kids and his rationalization will certainly deliver chills to most any viewer. Since this is Boston, it makes perfect sense for the reporters to be so distracted by the story, that it supersedes the Red Sox game they are attending at Fenway Park. Being that the investigation lasted well into 2001, it's quite informative to watch a news agency shift directions for the September 11 tragedy, and along with the nation, put all else on hold. Finally, there is a point in the movie where we as viewers have just about had our fill of extreme emotions \u2013 we either need to hit something or throw up \u2013 and reporter Rezendes comes through with exactly what is needed: an emotional outburst and release of exasperation rivaling anything previously seen on screen. It's a wonderful moment for Ruffalo as an actor, and a peak moment for viewers.\n\nThe story hit the front page of The Boston Globe in January 2002. The paper won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for its superlative investigative journalism. The report vindicated so many who had been taken advantage of, and exposed the colossal arrogance of the church. The innocence of a child vs the power of God. The story broke the faith that so many once held, and started a global (as evidenced by the closing credits) reckoning and awakening that was desperately needed. The film offers a line of dialogue, \"It takes a village to raise a kid \u0085 or abuse one.\" In other words, it took the often silent actions of so many to allow this despicably evil horror to continue. In a tribute to the newspaper profession, it took a small group of dedicated reporters to pull back a curtain that should never again be shut. Let's have faith in that."

Director Tom McCarthy's movie about the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese is shaking up to the be the frontrunner of the Best Picture Oscar, and why not? McCarthy's meticulous direction of the film and his layering of its expose was a sermonial, I mean a ceremonial piece of mastery. The Boston Globe's investigative \"Spotlight\" department shined on unveiling this disturbing truth. What was not disturbing was the exemplary acting performances from the actors playing the \"spotlight\" write players; including Mark Ruffalo as the emotional Mike Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as the conflicted Sacha Pfeiffer, Brian D'arcy James as the cerebral Matt Carroll, and the \"Birdman\" himself Michael Keaton as the group's leader Robby Robinson. Keaton and Ruffalo were the standouts here, but all should be given the proper spotlight for their commendable acting. Other fine thespian turns came from Stanley Tucci as the counsel Mitchell Garadebian, Liev Schrieber as the paper's new editor Marty Baron, and John Slattery as the associate editor Ben Bradlee. It will be very sad if this acting group does not get the SAG Best Acting Ensemble Award. McCarthy's script with fellow screenplayer Josh Singer had all of the write stuff of a multi- dimensional narrative covering an uncomfortable subject matter. Sure, the film does depict journalists as literary superheroes, but their procedural process workings was their greatest weapon to get rid of the darkness of the subject they were investigating; and it isn't that what superheroes do? or something like that? Anyways, I pray that \"Spotlight' receives many Oscar nominations, as it should. So, it's now time for you to see and then share the \"Spotlight\". ***** Excellent"

A horrifyingly shocking one. But this is a heroic story about those who went against the church & exposed its demonic priests. Its a challenging, undeniable story, where justice is eventually served to those who deserve nothing but pure punishment.\n\n'Spotlight' works from start to end. McCarthy and Josh Singer's Screenplay is powerful, as disturbing as it is. The Writing refuses to slow-down & the narrative is so engrossing, you can't move from your seat. You watch the heroes uncover a regrettable chapter of human history & the approach in the narrative, is no-holds-barred. Its non-stop, high-powered Drama.\n\nMcCarthy's Direction defines Command. The Director is in top-form & 'Spotlight' is his finest effort to date. No two options on that! Masanobu Takayanagi's Cinematography is first-class. Tom McArdle's Editing is razor-sharp, never allowing the goings-on to slow down at any given time. Howard Shore's score is perfect.\n\nPerformance-Wise: 'Spotlight' boasts an ensemble, who are at the peak of their powers. Michael Keaton is astonishing, delivering a yet another power-packed, classy performance. If you thought Birdman was the best he could've ever done, watch 'Spotlight'. The Screen-Legend dominates the show with a career-best turn. Mark Ruffalo is top-notch, as always. The powerhouse talent takes upon his character, like a fish takes to water. Rachel McAdams is a revelation. She surprises you with a nuanced, affecting performance. Brian d'Arcy James is terrific. Live Schreiber (whose Voice is of a lion), is excellent. John Slattery stands on his own & shines in the scenes he's in. Stanley Tucci is matchless, yet again. Billy Crudup does wonders in a bit role. The rest of the cast lend great support.\n\nOn the whole, 'Spotlight' is unmissable. It Screams Oscar! I Won't be surprised if a Clean Sweep happens in coming Feb."

Michael Keaton gives a strong performance as the leader of the team of reporters. However, it is Mark Ruffalo who emerges as the star of this movie. His performance dominates the movie. The subject of the story is controversial and sensitive.

        "review_detailed_main": "The awards season may just have found its first forerunner. In a 2015 movie year that has been average at best without any standout films initiating awards conversation, Tom McCarthy's Spotlight rising above the heap to assert itself as one of 2015's best.\n\nWith an all-star cast including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup, Spotlight shines a light on a 2001 investigation by The Boston Globe's on the sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.\n\nMichael Keaton plays Walter Robinson who leads the Globe's investigative unit with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams) and Matt Carrol (Brian d'Arcy James). Under a new editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), the team begins to unfold a horrific pattern of child sexual abuse by the church that was muted and covered up by high priced lawyers and payoffs to victim's families. As Walter probes further and further into the events (the setting is after the events the 9/11) the investigation reveals layers and layers of injustice of Catholic Priests that were aided by the highest powers of the church in an effort to keep the story muted.\n\nIt all starts with a featured column about Catholic priest John Geoghan who was accused of abusing over 100 boys. A civil suit is filed but the details of the abuse were ordered sealed by the courts. Schrieber's Baron puts the team of reporters on the case and within days the evil that lurked with the sacred rooms of local churches begins to reveal is foul and despicable face.\n\nThe investigation goes on for months as the team hits roadblock upon roadblock taking one step forward for every two steps back. But the story eventually breaks and the emotionally exhausted team is eventually able to bring to light one of the more depressing and important stories of the early new century.\n\nMichael Keaton was really good in last year's Birdman and named himself many awards and an Academy Award nomination for his part. In Spotlight, he may be even better. Under the direction of Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Station Agent), Keaton shines and carries a performance of determination, frustration and redemption that is delivered with precision.\n\nNods to All the President's Men will be inevitable. But that was a different era. A different movie. Spotlight is fresh and invigorating in its painfully frustrating subject matter. Audiences should leave with a renewed belief that investigative reporting is of monumental importance and that stories such as the one originating in 2001 Massachusetts are still out there clouded in red tape secrecy and muffled whispers. It is painful to watch at times. Trusted bonds between people, children, parents and the institution that promotes the opposite to what it sometimes preaches are disgusting revelations that are brought to the screen with sizzling effects.\n\nThe entire cast from top to bottom is perfectly cast. And McCarthy doesn't populate his frames with unnecessary spectacular visuals. Spotlight is instead very straight forward. Focused and driven.\n\nSpotlight will be nominated for Best Picture and Keaton should get a nod for Actor. Ruffalo may also sneak his way onto ballot sheets. But whether Spotlight wins any hardware is unimportant as long as we recognize the importance of films such as these. A few years ago I would guess that 99% of the population knew nothing about the Iran hostage rescue highlighted in Ben Affleck's Argo. Spotlight should have the same effect acting as a docudrama that is both highly entertaining and educational at the same time. It is both a very good film and an important one.\n\nhttp://theintestinalfortitude.com/"

The music and pacing was fine but at times felt like a really high end TV movie rather than a theatrical film. It is an affecting drama, well-told, I just felt it never reached the fever pitch of outrage it really should have, and the ending is quite underwhelming. There is a lot of talking/exposition/monologuing. Would have been nice for some revelations to happen visually/through action the audience could observe first hand. It feels kind of labored as is. I personally don't think anything about the film is awards worthy, except maybe Ruffalo (what else is new?) and while Todd McCarthy is a fine filmmaker, this is not his best film and nowhere near the directorial achievement of someone like Lenny Abrahamson for Room. I just feel like the reason critics are really raving about this film is that it shows their fellow journalists getting to be the heroes."

Reasonable information documentary type, yes; good movie, no. What we see is just some people scheduling some interviews and asking other people questions to gather information and publish an article. Where's the story in that for a movie? By the way, why does not Hollywood make a movie about 'pedophilia in Hollywood'?"

Reality is often depressing and this film is a reminder of that, but rather than letting abuse continue, the Spotlight team steps up and fights for what's right to save others moving forward and bring justice to those who suffered from abuse in years past. This movie will leave you shaken, but it is a necessary film and a very deserving best picture winner. I don't think it is among the top tier best picture winners, but still a very good movie. I remember seeing this when it first came out in 2015 during the award season, hoping The Revenant would win best picture, but 7 years later watching it again, I fully understand why this won best picture and it was the right choice. Lastly, the ensemble in this film is tremendous. Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schreiber in particular were all fantastic. There is a scene towards the end with Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton that is just outstanding, Ruffalo will undoubtedly receive an Oscar one day. Spotlight is a well done, yet devastating film with a fantastic cast. I recommend this film to anyone that is looking for an important film based on a true story. However, just a reminder that this is a very disturbing film at times and should be watched with caution."

There's no denying that there have been some wonderful TV/web series in recent years, but I think a film like Spotlight is the refresh button that moviegoers have been looking for. The story is compelling, the acting is unnoticeable, and the script seems to flow the way a real conversation would. The writers and director of this film are the \"Spotlight\" of filmmaking, opening up a sensitive story that people acknowledged but probably couldn't imagine on screen, and they brought it to us in a way where I felt all the emotions of someone finding out the truth for the first time. I watched Spotlight at the Z\u00fcrich Film Festival and after 2 hours, thought it ended too soon. The only negative thing I could think of was that those French & German subtitles were really getting in the way. Maybe next time, the director could remove those ;)"

        "review_detailed_main": "When the story broke about the systemic abuse in the Catholic Church between the members of the Clergy and children in their care and the cover up that followed it was world breaking stuff. It rightly shock the church to its core. Social Media made this possible and the cover up impossible to continue, one of the places where this started was the Boston Globe, who started investigating the story with its 'Spotlight' team, a group within the paper that investigate special interest stories. Led by Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton, first rate here as always) his small team take on the task full time only to have it temporarily delayed by the events of 9 / 11. But Robinson and his team are persistent and the more bureaucracy they come up against that seems determined to sweep things under the rug the more persistent they get until the bough breaks and final the cradle falls, leading to law suits world wide through out the church.\n\nCinema was made for films like these, not only is this film damn good, its probably one of the most important films to be made of the last decade and if its overlooked at the Oscars this will be nothing short of criminal. All the cast are first rate here and entirely convincing, from Rachel McAdams as the caring reporter with a heart, to Stanley Tucci's diligent yet suspicious lawyer whose all too aware of how fickle the loyalty of a reporter can be. Jamey Sheridan and Billy Crudup are just the right side of bent but it is Mark Ruffalo in his portrayal of reporter Mike Rezendes who take the acting honors here. His impassioned outburst must have resonated with many victims who were brave enough to watch the film when he cries out 'Why not now, what are we waiting for? We have to nail these bastards.' - Never before has a greater crime been committed against such a large number of innocent minors and all in the same of God. Watching the film makes me feel that the Church world wide should pay back every cent to the hell they put those people through. This film is not only demanding and rightly draining, it is vital viewing. Director Tom McCarthy should be proud of himself, because I know I am proud of him and writer Josh Singer, for bringing a project which was blacklisted, with a first rate script and cast to the screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "Storytelling takes many forms and mediums and as much as I enjoyed 'Spotlight', it could have been presented better by way of Documentary as opposed to the traditional 'Hollywood' storytelling narrative. Now being a fan of Documentaries, I tend to also enjoy films that fall into the category of 'based on actual events'. I know sometimes 'Hollywood' gets in the way of presenting a factual story but as great as the performances were from all leading cast members, I found that the characters were weak and overshadowed by the star power that took them on.\n\nClearly it was the punchy script that attracted the leading names because none of the characters had any real depth and really don't stand out as a role that an actor would 'just have to play'. Keating, McAdams, Ruffalo and Tucci were all great in the portrayal of real people - This was definitely Ruffalo's film. I get it though... This isn't a film about characters. It's a film about journalistic investigation (Hence why a documentary film may have been a better approach to tell this story). Hearing the word's come from those individuals who worked tirelessly to blow the lid off the Catholic Church in interview style would have made for a more gripping narrative. Spotlight just doesn't have the excitement that came with films like Argo or Erin Brockovich. Was it the director's choice to simply keep the characters two dimensional in order for the investigative journalism to shine through? If so, mission accomplished and well done. However, was the journalistic investigation interesting enough to warrant a 'Hollywood' story - I'm not sure. I was thirsty to know more about the characters motivations for pursuing this story. I was expecting a hardline connection by the Boston Globe to the Catholic Church in order to give that 'Ah-ha' moment that just never came. I was waiting for that 'Hollywood' moment that told the audience that this is why it warrants the storytelling narrative. I wanted an 'Erin Brockovich' and all I got was everyday 'John Smith'.\n\nWhat I did enjoy about this film is it's visual tone and production design. I enjoy seeking out time and place in regards to era based on the production design elements. The colours, lighting and depictions of the environment both internal and external were en pointe. Natural tones, Light makeup, non saturated colours assist to translate this as real life events - Well done.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid drama, well written with good honest dialogue between the players. Tom McCarthy has done an exceptional job with both the written word and direction. But traditionally we like our protagonists with a healthy does of antagonist, in this instance the catholic church was the antagonist, yet their presence wasn't really felt. They didn't come across as the 'big bad', there was no power struggle, the cover up was just spoken of without being shown. Even the victims stories didn't seem to have that vital punch to help drive home the message of evil. Our protagonist are a vital ingredient to the film recipe and here it was missing altogether.\n\nAnd finally, a little side note that always seems to 'erk' me with films that are 'Based on Actual Events' and thats the text based epilogue, commenting on what has happened in closing - For me, this is somewhat of a cop-out from film makers. As an audience member, I want my payoff, I want my finale and I want to see it brought to life by the characters I've just invested the last two hours in - I wanted to see the Catholic Church go down for those heinous acts. If I wanted to read about it, I would have written to the Boston Globe and asked for a copy of the story.\n\nIn this instance, I yearned for Hollywood to get in the way of a factual story. Deserving of a supporting actor nod for Ruffalo and a writing nod for McCarthy - but best picture? Nope - I'm not sold."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight (2015/I) was co-written and directed by Tom McCarthy. In the 70's, 80's, and into the 90's, \"everyone knew\" that some priests were sexually abusing children. However, no major newspaper had had the courage and/or the staff to bring the story to light.\n\nBy sheer determination, combined with investigative excellence, in 1992, the Boston Globe published a factual, detailed expose of the behavior of the rogue priests, and the cover-up of these abuses by high-ranking church officials.\n\nRemember that this was in Boston, where the main ethnic roots are Italian and Irish. Attacking the Catholic Church on what is basically its home turf wasn't easy, and it wasn't fun. However, publishing that story brought many people to the realization that they were dealing with a highly flawed institution. Also, those flaws of abuse and cover-up were nation-wide, not just in Boston. (And, as it turned out, not just in the U.S.) The Boston Globe won the Pulitzer price for reporting, and it was richly deserved.\n\nThis movie gives you the feel of a nuts-and-bolts investigation. Blocked avenues that must be circumvented or somehow opened; dealing with people who were damaged by the abuse; working against the power of the church and its supporters; working with people who should be helpful, but who have their own agenda.\n\nThe cast includes many fine actors: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Stanley Tucci, and Billy Crudup. It's an ensemble movie--each reporter has a distinct personality, as do the lawyers, the churchmen, and the victims.\n\nAs I write this review, Spotlight has an overall 8.6 rating, which is extraordinarily high. Believe the rating--it's a great film.\n\nP.S. I hope everyone reading this review who lives in or near Rochester, NY, recognizes the quality of the films shown at The Little Theatre, on East Avenue. Right now The Little is screening Suffragette, Trumbo, Spotlight, and Brooklyn. (Also Macbeth, which we haven't yet seen.) If you love movies, and you're not a member of The Little, you should be!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight has two main things going for it. A very strong script from Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer that is reminiscent of All The President's Men and the stellar cast made up of Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, Mark Ruffalo, Stanley Tucci, John Slattery and Brian d'Arcy James. But besides all of those 2 great aspects, does Spotlight present itself as the film that deserves the slew of award nominations that it has been slammed with? To me, no.Spotlight seems to be a movie that shows itself as an amazing film but lacks focus on characters and doesn't stretch boundaries for cinema. Does that mean all that praise isn't in the film? No, Spotlight does shine brightly in the script and performances.\n\nSpotlight is based on the true story of the Boston Globe reporters in the Spotlight section that are tasked with finding evidence for a story on the Catholic Church child molestation cases but discover something bigger in the process. The 128 minute film follows the reporters as they come across the victims of these molestations. While others will say Michael Keaton is the standout in this film for me it's Mark Ruffalo giving my personal favorite performance from him. Stanley Tucci, Liev Schreiber, Rachel McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James give great performances that help give the film a bit more shape but sadly it doesn't help that their characters and how they're shown to us are the root of my problem with Spotlight. Spotlight's characters are never given much detail so we don't really feel a personal connection with the reporters like we should\u0085 because they're the main characters.\n\nThe writing in Spotlight is great and definitely deserving of the awards it gets. While the characters are written from a bird's eye view it at least gets us to sympathize with the characters and get us invested in how they discover the conspiracy, I wish the directing were the same. Tom McCarthy is a director that hasn't been able to wow me. This is probably because the last film I saw him direct was The Cobbler, one of the worst films of 2015, and he did the opposite of intrigued me and more or less had me rock in the fetal position and think about the choices I have made in my life. He does an adequate job for a biopic. It's really hard to get me to love a biopic nowadays because they all follow the same movements and never fascinate me. A minor nitpick is that each time something important happens in the movie a few notes from the piano played and it was cute the first time but really made me question as to why that had to be the go to music for those moments.\n\nSpotlight is just another Oscar baity film (a term I hate using but is definitely true in this case) that has a great script with decent direction and outstanding performances from Keaton and Ruffalo. But the lack of depth in the characters just astounds me. Easily could have been directed better if Spielberg had taken helm. I would definitely recommend to watch but not deserving of Best Picture in my mind. It's definitely a great film that should be shown to people who want more info on the scandal."

I agree that the story-telling is clear and unfolds in a way that adds to your knowledge of the history of events, but that could be achieved in a documentary too. I don't agree that the acting was great, it felt mediocre to me, but with its ensemble cast you have weak characters, no character development and so very little for the actors to get their teeth into. It felt to me like any drama or tension was crow-barred in for the purposes of giving the audience some excitement, when for example Mark Ruffalo's character is running to the records office and banging on the door as it closes. Such moments seemed forced and straight out of the clich\u00e9 book. Commendable to make a film on this subject and bring people's attention to the crimes that were allowed to continue to take place,but a worthy subject does not make a great film. For me the direction was really dull and this looked like it could have been made for TV. A much better film on the subject is 'Doubt' without doubt."

This movie answers that question.\n\nWhat it doesn't answer is why the Church hierarchy didn't just de- frock the pedophile priests, rather than move them from parish to parish. Kicking them out would have STOPPED the abuse rather than just MANAGING the abuse. It would have sent a message to other pedophile priests and actually done something to fix the problem rather than perpetuate it.\n\nThe other question I have is this: the vast majority of people in all churches and all religions are good people, doing good work with good intentions. How could Catholic Church hierarchy have allowed the pedophile priests to remain in the Church when they knew that children were being abused. How could they have allowed the children. How?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Did SPOTLIGHT deserve to win Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards? Maybe, I guess. I still haven't seen all of the nominees yet, but even still I recognize that SPOTLIGHT is an excellent film. Based on true events, it tells how the Boston Globe broke the story about a massive cover-up of pedophile priests in the Catholic Church. It also features an incredible ensemble cast who, although not given much to do individually, work great together in service of a very compelling (and saddening) story. Out of the five actors given top billing, I would say that Liev Schreiber and Mark Ruffalo fare the best, although the rest of the cast don't slouch by any means. Rachel McAdams is perhaps the weakest out of the bunch, but even she mostly holds her own. Far and away, the most important takeaways are the devotion to pursuing the truth no matter where it leads you, as well as the integrity necessary in investigative journalism. Some people have called this the greatest journalism movie since ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but I still need to see that in order to make such a comparison. Briefly touching on other matters, I thought the score and cinematography were quite adequate enough to elevate this beyond something that would normally play as a made-for-HBO movie. In particular, I liked the use of substantial tracking shots, which visually reinforced the winding and interconnected paths that the Globe's spotlight team go on in pursuit of their story. Ultimately, there is a lot in here that could shake one's faith in humanity and human institutions, particularly religion, however I never felt like they demonized anyone. It merely acknowledged the imperfections and, some of the time, willful negligence of said institutions and the communities they serve, while also aspiring to better accountability in both. Best Picture winner or not, SPOTLIGHT is hands down one of the best that 2015 had to offer."

        "review_detailed_main": "With a movie like Spotlight, the one thing you can say against it is that it's not particularly showy. We won't remember the movie this year let alone years from now for its cinematography (though perhaps its lack of being 'showy' or really darkly lit or stark in contrasts is its own visual statement). This isn't to say that Tom McCarthy doesn't so his job as a director in an elemental sense; he does get some good shots (there's one where the camera simply backs up as a crucial statistic is laid out by the ex-priest turned therapist who gives the Spotlight reporters what they need to move forward into the bigger picture of their story, and it works beautifully). But what he does is put together the best cast possible - Keaton, Ruffalo, John Slattery (as Ben Bradley Jr, which I'll touch on in a moment), Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, and even Richard Jenkins as the voice on the phone - and makes sure that they're all on a level where no one ever upstages another. The story is all here.\n\nIt's a subject that carries with it some exposition - you got to know the facts of this case, and there are times you get a lot of information, not unlike say Law & Order SVU - but it's all in service of a narrative that makes it welcome and exciting. This is about what it means to craft a story and to get it right, but what 'right' even means in the grand scheme of things, which here being the sort of Court of Public Opinion. If you don't get the facts right, or have enough 'deep cover' to back things up, things can be poked through, especially in the context of this story being in Boston and the Catholic church. While pederasty wasn't unheard of in 2001 with the priests and organization in general, it was seen as more-so isolated incidents. The key to Spotlight being so compelling is to draw the viewer in the same way the reporters do: the stakes here are so high.\n\nIt's easy to compare this to All the President's Men for a number of reasons; one thing I saw as an interesting coincidence was two generations of Ben Bradleys here, with Robards as the Senior in 'Presidents' at the Washington Post and the Junior played by a no-BS Slattery, similar level of sarcasm in the midst of professional talk by the way. What it comes down to is how much do performances and the search for information against a super-powerful institution (one the branches of government and conspiracy of the Executive level, the other an institution that \"thinks in centuries\" as notes in the film) elevate the material? I think just as with the Pakula film, this does it exceptionally well. While it may not have the same sort of effect of that 76 film (no Gordon Willis, as I said it's not a particularly stand-out film as far as the look), Spotlight really has some deep things to address about faith and trust, and it doesn't shy away from making these reporters real people in the midst of their search.\n\nRuffalo and Keaton may stand out the most for people, chiefly as they get (I think, I could be wrong) more impactful screen time as they are each looking for precious information (the former with his connection to Tucci's lawyer, who handles cases involving pedophilia and the church and in the screwed up legal system, the latter with the 'source' he has and his own background growing up in Boston and the Church). But I was very impressed by the screen time being evenly laid out; Ruffalo and Keaton may get the Oscar attention, but Schreiber has a number of remarkable scenes, such as an awkward/polite conversation with Cardinal Law, and McAdams as she knocks on doors and has the most startling scene involving a conversation with a priest who reveals, remarkably, candidly, that he didn't really see what he did as rape (he should know, he says, as he was raped).\n\nIf you like seeing a cast keeping things grounded and realistic, and yet have moments of powerful drama and conflict that cuts at a lot of corners of society (especially, also, involving class as this is also a class issue involving low-income families having kids who were molested/raped), this is a film to see. It doesn't exactly leave you feeling all that 'good', but it does celebrate what journalism can do in an unfussy, unsentimental way that is refreshing too."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Spotlight' is a good film but it doesn't go beyond just \"good\" because it is interesting but not very engaging.\n\nThe film adopts a straight-to-the-point approach to telling the story of The Boston Globe's investigation into the cover-up of multiple incidents of child abuse within the Catholic Church. This is a good way of recounting real life events but not the best way to make a film that engages and resonates with an audience.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with this approach is that it neglects the development of the characters. And I don't just mean character development, in which characters change or learn something over the course of a story. I mean characters that are well rounded and engaging in some way. None of the characters stood out to me. I missed most of their names so I just referred to them in my head by their actors' names. My lack of investment in the film made the ending feel anti-climatic. From a logical point of view, it isn't, but there was nothing really substantial to hook me in and feel the arc of the story.\n\nThe actors all do a fine job by their way. My favourite scenes were the ones in which the members of the Spotlight team interact with survivors of these abuse cases. The actors who played the two survivors (Neal Huff and Michael Cyril Creighton) were believable and made me invested in their scenes. It's possible that my lack of familiarity with them helped sell those scenes but they were well suited and made an impression either way.\n\nIn at least one review, the visual style has been compared to that of a TV drama, and I can understand why this comparison was made. Tom McCarthy's directorial decisions seem to be based mostly on capturing the actors instead of making the film more engrossing. The directing is still good, but it doesn't do anything to balance out the flat characters. The generic music that felt too bland for a theatrical feature also didn't help matters.\n\nOverall, 'Spotlight' is a good film that stands out mostly due to its cast and subject matter. I wouldn't really recommend it unless you find the topic interesting or you already want to see this film.\n\nYou can read more of my reviews at: http://letterboxd.com/lloyd_morgan/films/reviews/"

It's based on the true events of a group of reporters that investigates the cases of sexual abuse of priests against children's in the 80's. This movie shows how corrupt even the most \"sacred intuition\" can be and how blinded people can be for their own benefit, or defending what they believe to be correct, putting aside the harm they are making. McCarthy made an excellent direction that can be seen even in the little meanings that are shown in the transition scenes. The performance of the actors portraying the dedication and the sensitivity of the reporters it's just remarkable. I highly recommend this film, it's really worth watching."

The main problem here is you have a story with heavy subject matter, and a realistic portrayal about how a group of journals might go about solving the problem. But the realism doesn't allow for a dramatic engaging look into the issue that gets to its core, that is hard hitting enough for the subject's weight. Basically it needed someone in the movie to go, \"It's about child rape. What's the moral grey area of that assh-les?\" Instead Mark Ruffalo goes ham but not really. \"If it takes a village to raise the child, it takes a village to abuse one.\" It needed more of that."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight refers to the group of investigative reporters who work for The Boston Globe. The group has been there since the 1970 and will often spend months working on a single story. In 2001, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) comes in from Florida as their new editor-in-chief and asks the current team to put their latest investigation on hold and look into allegations of a Catholic priest's sexual abuse against a minor and the potential cover-up. Retiring editor Walter \"Robbie\" Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his team of reporters are hesitant at first, considering Baron to be an outsider just trying to stir things up. Eventually Robbie and his investigators Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) agree to the story and find the truth is much worse than one priest and one child.\n\nMy only concern was the potential for deep lulls in the movie pulling the investigation and interviews together for their story over the course of the 2 hour and 8 minute film. The \"lulls\" of the investigation were actually the driving points of the film. Each stone the team overturned revealed more abuses, more victims and more cover-up on what turned out to be a global scale. I gave Spotlight an anticipatory 3.5 stars as I had a feeling it would be entertaining, moving and bold, but probably one of those films that seeing it once or twice would be enough without feeling the need or desire to own it. I actually lowered it half a star. Again, it's tough to rate these movies on their creative license when they are based on true stories, however, the main purpose of these reviews is to gauge how accurately the film as portrayed in the preview. The preview for Spotlight made it seem like religious leaders, politicians, lawyers and more would be vehemently blocking the team's investigation and story at every turn. In truth, it really wasn't that difficult for them to find attorneys, victims, and even perpetrators who were willing to come forward to help them piece their story together. There was a lot of talk about how powerful the church was and the reach of their control with friends in influential places, but little action to that effect throughout their digging.\n\nSpotlight was, as anticipated, disgustingly moving and disturbing. It was well-written and brilliantly acted by the entire team, but a bit less dramatic than the preview lead me to believe. I enjoyed it, might watch it again, but most likely won't be making it to my home collection."

I hope that everyone sees it if only to reinforce the harsh reality that there are evil, corrupt, and powerful people in the world who use that power to increase that power, instilling fear and pain in the meek and poor.\n\nEvery scene builds exactly as it must, step by step, increasing in the shocking revelation that not only were some Boston priests getting away with child rape for decades, but a lot of people knew it. Worse yet, the people who had the power to stop it didn't because no one had the guts to stand up to the power or majesty of the church. Indeed, even the reporters at the Boston Globe had to face that even they botched several early chances to stop the abuse, but either the truth seemed too shocking to be real, or their own religious beliefs closed their eyes to reality.\n\nGiven the global scope of the child rape scandal, it shocks me that anyone with a strong religious belief could remain an active member in the Catholic church. Possibly the most shocking moment comes just before the end credits, when we briefly see pages of cities in America where rape scandals occurred, then pages of cities around the world where rape scandals occurred.\n\nMichael Keaton is good, but not as inspired as in Birdman. Mark Ruffalo has a good yell to inspire Oscar tremors. Actually, everyone is very good in the movie, especially Stanley Tucci as the misunderstood grump with a heart of gold, and even Liev Schreiber, who plays a man with no emotion about as well as anyone could. The actors portraying the victims do excellent jobs as well, never letting terror or discomfort overcome the need to tell their stories.\n\nThere's only one scene that seemed off: a little halfway through, a group from the Spotlight team are in the basement archives, and Michael Keaton doesn't have his reading glasses , so he awkwardly states he can't read without his reading glasses. That's a goofy insert at an awkward time, and could have been handled much more fluidly. Other than that, this is surely a must-see of 2015."

One of the elements that was really intriguing is how long it actually takes for this team to compile this particular story. It took them mouths to finish the story, but it does not feel like mouths, cause they make the story they try to compile interesting to watch. Plus we get to know the characters on a personal level without getting too personal. Nothing takes us away from the main focus of the movie.\n\nMark Ruffalo gives an impressive performance as Michael Rezendes. He was very intense and passionate and it comes off great, and was a great role for him. He stood out in a very interesting ensemble cast that included Michael Keaton, as the editor of spotlight supporting his reporters as they chase the story and Liev Schreiber, as the new editor and chief of the Globe, an outsider who saw a story that the others too close to home, did not. They're other great performances from Rachel McAdams and Stanley Tucci as well.\n\nSpotlight also makes Boston itself a charter, by using scenery to show what a small town it can be and how much of an influence the Catholic Church has on it.\n\nIt hits all the right buttons without trying, that's a sign of good story telling. It brings you into a compelling story, well acted by a great cast that did great things together."

        "review_detailed_main": "A small team of journalist working for the Boston Globe under the code name 'Spotlight' set to work on one of their biggest stories ever; child-molestation within the Catholic church. Naturally, gathering the evidence they require to get the article to print isn't going to be easy, but through hard work and determination Walter and his team begin chasing up all possible leads and slowly, but surely, they begin to get the proof that they need...\n\nAs I said in my summary, Spotlight is a lot to take in on its first viewing; lots of people are interviewed, lots of notes are taken etc so there's a lot of information for the viewer to take in and process. What worked for me about this film is that although it can be difficult to follow it all in its entirety, the main core of the subject is interesting and at the very least the film is focussed and covers its 2 hour running time fairly quickly.\n\nAnybody who is at least remotely switched on shouldn't be entirely surprised about stories of corruption within the Catholic church; any institution where people are placed in a position of trust is sadly going to result in a few bad apples. I think what sets things apart here is that it's not just a few bad apples, but more like several orchard trees where every apple is rotten to the core. In Spotlight its about scale it's the numbers involved that make it shocking and this is further exacebated by those who knew about it choosing to turn a blind eye.\n\nAs well as an involving story and good production values, Spotlight also benefits from a great cast all at the top of their game. It's hard to single out anyone for any particular praise so I will just say that all of the main players were equally as good as one another.\n\nAlthough some may categorise the subject matter as off-putting Spotlight is a film that I would highly recommend. It throws light on a subject that many would be too afraid to talk about and just goes to show that the people whom we perceive to offer the least threat should sometimes be feared the most.\n\nIt's the best film I've seen in quite some time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although it pains me to say this, I suppose that it is the truth, and therefore, cannot be brushed off as inconsequential: Spotlight is the best film that I have seen this year. I say this with some regret, because prior to having seen this film, I was convinced that no film could surpass the quality of Mad Max: Fury Road, and much of the films deemed as \"Oscar bait\" were little more than senseless, boring, over-acted, and rudely political dramas.\n\nAh well. Apparently politics has its place.\n\nSpotlight is All the President's Men for my generation, in that it takes pity on our decrepit attention span and limited intellectual capacity, opting instead for a slower, less spastic narrative that successfully engages our minds without leaving us choking on its dust. If anything, it's a much better film than Pakula's classic, because it takes Redford and Hoffman's breakneck sleuthing, and intersperses it with an unexpected but welcome dose of real and painful human emotion. While Pakula's characters were inconsistent, McCarthys' have satisfying arcs and much more depth. Spotlight is focused and ambitious, and yet, manages to be an emotional experience.\n\nSpotlight deals with a rather uncomfortable subject, and to its credit, refuses to water it down with taciturn dialogue and unceremonious character interactions. It is raw, and occasionally explicit (only in the verbal sense), the film conveying the real-life events of the discovery of sexual abuse towards children in the Catholic Church with all the fury that such a story should entail. Mark Ruffalo stars as Mike Rezendes, a reporter working on the \"Spotlight\" team at the Boston Globe in 2001. The film follows the same structure as All the President's Men, in that much of its running time is consumed by searching through records, convincing people to testify, and awkward interviews.\n\nThe one and only thing I didn't like about the film was Mark Ruffalo's performance, which, considering the fact that he was the main character, interfered with my enjoyment of the film. His character seemed to hover precariously between sociopathic and sensitive, making it seem as if Ruffalo felt out of place in his own skin. At times he is passionate, at other times he is unfeelingly ambitious and rude. I suppose that the journalist character has been, to a certain extent, narrowed down to an uninteresting clich\u00e9 of ambition and insensitivity. But, to McCarthy's credit, while Rezendes is often rude and tiresome, he has moments of riveting and unsettling emotion, transforming him from an ambitious journalist to an passionate and sensitive individual.\n\nTaking into consideration the intellectual effect that the film manages to captivate the audience with, Ruffalo's performance is only a slight restraint. Spotlight is riveting and fun, giving the audience a well-deserved break from sloppy, boring dramas that critics seem to lap up without the slightest consideration as to how good the film actually is. It's a film that is good because it is made with sensitivity and intelligence, rather than a film that succeeds based on a label or on a performance. Taking into consideration the films I have seen, I can say with a certain degree of confidence that Spotlight is the best film of 2015."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having lived in Boston, and having been raised Catholic, there were many elements of \"Spotlight\" that were impressive.\n\nThe story concerns the Boston Globe's 2001 investigation into sexual abuse of minors committed by priests, and how the Catholic church covered up the crimes by moving the priests from parish to parish.\n\nThe reporters are members of the Spotlight team, which work on important, investigative stories. They are are Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). Their boss is Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), and his boss is the new guy in town, editor Martin \"Marty\" Baron (Leiv Schreiber). Above all of them is Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery).\n\nFor many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories.\n\nWhen an attorney, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) claims that the Archbishop of Boston knew that Father John Geoghan, a priest in the diocese was sexually abusing children, the bishop did nothing.\n\nBaron wants the Spotlight reporters to find out whether it's true, whether if it's an isolated incident, or if it is a common practice. When 9/11 hits, they have to put the story on hold, but pick it up again.\n\nFascinating story, and we see the investigation grow from the beginning, from trying to interview victims, then priests, getting sealed documents from court, and the shock of learning how widespread the problem is.\n\nThe film also focuses on the pressure and lack of cooperation from outside sources, the reverence with which people hold the Church, and the tremendous influence and hold that it has on the city. When one boy was abused, the Cardinal visited his home to calm the waters, and \"my mother served freakin' cookies.\" For someone in my mother's generation, it is a devastating story.\n\nSeeing the Boston locations was amazing -- including exactly where I once worked in Government Center. The acting, including the accents, was excellent, but nothing overwhelmed the story. The emphasis seemed to be on ensemble performance and keeping the story up front.\n\n\"Spotlight\" tells a sobering, sad tale. As one of the sources says, \"The church is an institution of men, and even well-meaning men fail.\" One questions how well-meaning men were who decided to keep this quiet. And the point is made in the film that spirituality and faith are separate from formalized religion."

Fantastically written and exciting, with many shocking and sad moments. This is a movie that stays in your head after the credits have finished rolling. When you saw the list of all the places where child molestation by priests has taken place, I just wanted to vomit. That was a lot.\n\nThe church and the priests shall be holy and forgiving. You should feel trust and feel safe there. Priests that then commit child molestation is not holy behavior, and unforgivable in my opinion. Especially when they also cover up the whole thing. The whole system. Unforgivable. Unholy. What a scandal. What a movie."

I sympathized with the victims, with the journalists, even the TV lawyer who did dozens of settlements. I cried when the victims recounted the stories of their abuse. I exalted when Mike Rezendes (played by Ruffalo) finally got what he was after. I could feel the emotion of Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams) as she took notes from the victim she interviewed. I could say other great things about Michael Keaton, Liev Schreiber, and Stanley Tucci. It's just an amazing ensemble cast with truly flawless acting performances. It really is tough to watch in parts, but this story is an amazing tribute to the important of investigative journalism.\n\nThank you for making this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Spotlight\" is the \"All the President's Men\" of a new movie generation.\n\nEstablishing a journalistic tone that matches the film's setting, it tells the story of a Boston newspaper team's efforts to expose the sexual abuse running rampant throughout the Catholic Church. It's a film with hardly a misstep or false note. Eschewing the histrionics and emotional manipulation that other films would have brought to the same material, \"Spotlight\" understands that the screenplay and actors hired to interpret it are strong enough without any emotional embellishment, and the film is far more powerful because of the understated approach. The entire cast is at top form, with Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and John Slattery as the standouts (Ruffalo in particular delivers an impassioned soliloquy so emotionally powerful that it nearly brought me to tears), but this is an ensemble film with actors working together like a well-oiled machine, and it seems unfair to single out any one when they're all so good.\n\nDirector Tom McCarthy is most known for his work to date on the Pixar movies, and you couldn't find a movie further away from the colorful palettes and winsome stories of the Pixar world. But he proves himself a versatile filmmaker, one who knows how to handle extremely varied material. It would be easy to discount the direction of this film, but one should not underestimate how difficult directing a film that consists almost entirely of conversations would be. And when one also considers that part of good directing is getting good performances from actors, McCarthy's goes down as some of the best directing of the year.\n\nSo far, this and \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" are my two favorite movies of the year. How's that for opposite sides of the movie spectrum?\n\nGrade: A+"

It just wasn't best picture to me (for which it won an Academy Award, along with best screenplay). For that it played it far too safely. Much of the movie reminded me of the 1994 \"The Paper\", also headlined by Michael Keaton.\n\nIn a way, The Paper was better because it was entirely fictional and therefore could go all-out. \"Spotlight\" (named after the editorial crew of the Boston Globe that uncovered the scandal) kinda had to try to fit the facts. For example, the journalists seemed to do relatively little uncovering themselves, for that they relied heavily on attorneys, experts and interest groups, and at times they even blocked the investigation. Boston is described as a type of mafia territory where you can't escape the Catholic church, except for when you're Jewish or Armenian. That seemed a pretty shallow explanation.\n\nRachel McAdams didn't seemed too much of a Hollywood blonde to fit into the newspaper. Have you ever seen newspaper journalists? There's a reason they don't work in front of the camera.\n\nFor me, I'd rather have a great movie about a trifling subject than a good movie about an important subject. Because I don't like being schooled by mother."

We should never forget all those children who for decades faced abuse at the hands of priests whom they trusted and looked up to. It is sickening to to see in the movie how the Catholic church tried at every turn to cover up the abuse perpetrated by its priests.'Spotlight' brings the stories of abuse victims to light,and while there is good and bad in everyone,those that abuse the trust others put in them should be prosecuted and not have their crimes covered up,whether it be by the Catholic Church or anyone else.I would highly recommend this movie,go and see this.While their is a sad story being told the actors and director brought this story to light vividly. There is a tension in the movie that keeps you interested until the very end."

After I left the cinema hall in my town I felt some kind of unease inside me. This feeling was provoked not only by the fact that the movie is based on a terrifying true story but also by how the actors accomplished to bring this story to life with ravishing performances from Mark Ruffalo (Mike Rezendes), Michael Keaton (Walter 'Robby' Robinson), Rachel McAdams (Sacha Pfeiffer) and Brian d'Arcy James (Matt Carroll).\n\n'Spotlight' follows the story of an investigation, conducted by the team 'Spotlight', working for the daily newspaper - Boston Globe. The team of 4 investigating journalists brings to light a 30-year-old secret that has its roots deeply in the Chatolic Church hierarchy. A story, about child molestation, which nobody can be indifferent to. Most of the molested back then kids - 30 years later with kids of their own, had been through many obstacles due to the ghastly immoral act. Some of them had taken the path of the syringe and drugs. Others had gone crazy and schizophrenic and the other part had killed themselves due to maybe the embarrassment they had to live with for the rest of their lives afterward.\n\nMost of the kids, who were molested would not talk about the act, because they were in some way petted by the priests and were too scared and too abashed to talk with somebody about this. Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' shows us the importance of the investigating journalist's work and also that they have the power to unfold great mysteries to the public no matter how dark and horrifying the mysteries are."

It is a movie that should have been made properly since abstract headlines don't tell a lucid story. However, making it from the point of view of the Boston Globe journalists simply isn't that interesting. It should just have been one of the aspects of the movie but not the main one. More emphasis on the victims and families, some major perpetrators, high ranking clergy actually doing the cover up etc could have been shown. After all, the reporters are not the main players in this tragedy. A more complete picture like in \"And the Band Played On\" would have been better. Difficult to keep track of who all the lawyers and reporters are.\n\nThe earnest actors are all people you want to see succeed in their quest. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams particularly exude journalistic integrity. Liev Schreiber looks different here. As far as awards there just isn't that much of an actual acting role for any of the lead actors.\n\nThe wrong focus of the story makes a scandal difficult to follow and tedious."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight is a remarkably well-written and phenomenally acted film that tells a shocking and disturbing true story that just floored me.\n\nFirst of all, I went into this film not really knowing anything. I knew it involved the Boston Globe, that there was some sort of scandal with the Catholic Church, and that it takes place in the early 2000's. That's all I knew, and as the film unfolded before me, and revealed bit by bit of it's amazing, astonishing story, I was completely blown away by how incredible the writing and acting in this film was.\n\nTom McCarthy both wrote and directed this film, and he did a phenomenal job on both ends. What he did when writing this screenplay is that he didn't make the reporters who are working on this case heroes. He made them who they truly are; reporters who care about their jobs, who care about the story, who care about justice being served to the right people. He makes them incredibly human, and through this, these characters become very relatable to the people who watch this film.\n\nA lot of the way that Spotlight tells its story is so subdued to the point of brilliance. Sure, this is an Oscar movie, but there really aren't any \"Oscar scenes\" in this movie, save for one scene in which a character has an outburst of sorts. These actors are really holding back their dramatic chops in this film. For example, when you here bad news, do you throw a chair against a wall and go into a temper tantrum? No. In this film, as this case builds, and builds, and builds to the point where you're amazed that this is a true story, the characters in this film simply shake their head, sit back, and say things that actual people would say, like \"Oh my goodness,\" or \"Wow\u0085 This is not good.\" It's truly riveting stuff.\n\nThe entire cast in this film is spectacular. Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James, and Stanley Tucci all do great work. Liev Schreiber is great in this movie as the new editor-in-chief at the Globe, and I loved seeing him in a more restrained dramatic role that I'm not accustomed to seeing him in. Michael Keaton is terrific in this movie, and I'm so glad that Birdman wasn't just a fluke for his career resurgence. He is truly subdued, and brilliant in this film. However, Mark Ruffalo is the standout in this film. He gives one of the best performances of his career in this film, and the voice he has in the movie really works with his character to the point where I didn't even see Mark Ruffalo. And honestly, that statement pretty much goes for every single actor/actress in this film, and that's because the story and the characters are so well-realized. And when you have well-known actors disappearing into their roles to the point where you don't recognize them, that deserves praise.\n\nSpotlight is one of the best films of the year, and it deserves nothing less than that."

I have no problem with anybody putting this in the same league as that iconic classic. It is that good. It is that relevant. The acting is superior. There is not a lot of flash. It is a lot of shoe-leather work and this movie presents it with great tension and integrity. This is a masterpiece."

Mark Ruffalo is just too much Mark Ruffalo as is Michael Keaton very much Michael Keaton. I would have added a few less known actors to the cast to make it more natural. To me Liev Schreiber was the most credible, Stanley Tucci (with hair!) did also a great job. Watching the movie it had a bit of a old fashioned feel of the 70ths, any moment Robert Redford could show up, and I think that is the reason I was not completely convinced.

        "review_detailed_main": "Another 2015 big name ensemble piece, with a heavy storyline, Spotlight was sure to be a brilliant film, until it wasn't. Directed by Tom McCarthy, Spotlight brought together Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and Stanley Tucci to tell the true life story of how a writing team on the Boston Globe first broke the sex abuse scandal within the Catholic Church. As a Roman Catholic, I expected to be disgusted, saddened, and perhaps angry at the events that were to take place on screen. Instead, I was simply stricken by how badly scratched my favorite watch has become.\n\nTaking place within the confines of the overtly Catholic Boston, Massachusetts, any egregious claims against the Catholic Church is going to be outright denied and silenced. With the urging of a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), the premier investigative team of the Boston Globe's known as Spotlight, is propelled to examine the claims of sexual abuse against young boys at the hands of their priests. Coyly led by Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), the team acts on the scarce archived clippings they have to see if there is anything to the allegations. Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), is the forceful hothead with the most screen time, clearly trying to settle his own score with the Catholic Church. Mike's constant contact with the tight-lipped lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci), representing the victims, is strained as Garabedian reveals that he has sent material to the Boston Globe in the past and been ignored. Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), another member of the team makes headway interviewing victims and former priests discovering that one of the men who oversees a victim's support group has also, years before, sent information to the Globe only to be ignored. The obvious resistance to the story from the community does not remain outside the Globe's walls. Through an intense scene of dialogue between the writers and editors, Robby reveals that it was he who ignored the information being sent to the Globe years before. Trying to make things right now, Robby goes after all leads with a fierce intensity. As evidence mounts, the team is driven to expose what too many people are content in keeping a well-known secret.\n\nTypically, a film bogged down almost from the beginning by poor pacing, is going to be filled with rich dialogue. This is not the case for this film; Spotlight, is slow with very sparse, elementary dialogue throughout. Michael Keaton and Stanley Tucci both give excellent performances (but when don't they?) Mark Ruffalo's Mike was insufferably overacted and took on far too many distracting nuisance, for instance, I know that Ruffalo can act in an entire movie only speaking through pursed lips. Rachel McAdams, who I tend to like watching, also tried too hard to be an investigative journalist, complete with spastic head movements and darting eyes, and forgot to be an actress. All of these intricacies that I'm sure the talented actors were using to lend realism to their characters were incredibly distracting and removed me from much of the film.\n\nIt's difficult when you leave a film you were looking forward to and expected to enjoy and being disappointed. It's even more difficult when you are a fan of the snubbed Carol, unable to comprehend how a masterpiece was overlooked but the Academy found a place for Spotlight. This film is one that if you skip, you won't miss and probably won't be talked about again, unlike some of the other Best Picture nominees."

This film really opened up my eyes a lot and I think that it will do the same for those of us who are unaware of the atrocities committed towards so many people across the world."

        "review_detailed_main": "We tend to see trends in theme hitting movie theaters around the same time. This usually has something to do with where our national focus or collective social consciousness lies. For example, with all the talk recently about marriage equality and racism and the #blacklivesmatter campaign, we are seeing a number of movies about the fight for a group's individual rights such as Suffragette and Freeheld. With international tensions mounting over possible nuclear arms in North Korea we are seeing Cold War era films such as Bridge of Spies and Pawn Sacrifice. Or Trumbo, which deals with both of those themes! What, then, is it about large-scale bureaucratic cover up that is drawing our attention? I'm not sure, but Truth is currently playing which tells the story of the military hiding discrepancies in President George W. Bush's service history and Snowden is scheduled to be released soon, a narrative feature chronicling the Edward Snowden scandal that was captured so wonderfully in last year's Oscar winning documentary Citizenfour. Even Steve Jobs is about one man taking credit for the work of an entire team, in effect covering up their contribution by means of bureaucratic red tape. It has also given us Spotlight, the gripping new film to hit theaters about the investigative journalism at The Boston Globe that uncovered the world-wide pedophilic scandal within the Catholic Church. And, true to its theme, the star of Spotlight is not any member of the stunning cast, but the investigation itself.\n\nBased on actual events, the screenplay co-written by Josh Singer (The Fifth Estate, Fringe) and Tom McCarthy (The Cobbler, The Visitor), who also directs, follows the Spotlight team at The Boston Globe. Spotlight is an elite department made up of four investigative journalists who take their time in breaking major stories, exhausting every resource before printing the article. In 2001, it is brought to their attention that...\n\nCheck out the full review on David 'n the Dark!\n\nhttps://davidnthedark.wordpress.com/2015/11/08/another-spotlight-on- bureaucratic-cover-up-2/#more-1265"

If the corruption uncovered had involved thefts of money instead of only molesting children, there would have been efforts to dismantle the institution for the public good. Fortunately, no money was stolen. In fact, some of the molested children and their families received token payments of money so they wouldn't feel so bad about what had happened. Church friends tell me they feel bad about the \"incident\", but will continue to cling to the church and its important dogma and leave God to punish any priests who might have been guilty. It is difficult to watch this movie, accept its depiction of events as true, and also know that the problem isn't solved. These are the people who establish our moral guidelines, who intercede for us when we sin, who monitor our lives, and who molest our children. I cry."

        "review_detailed_main": "The politics in this movie will probably earn it some Oscar nominations, because if there's anything we know about the Academy it's that it loves historically or politically significant movies (The Imitation Game, American Sniper, The Theory of Everything as nominations for Best Picture just from last year). This movie will be a shoe-in for the nomination, but more importantly it deserves the nomination.\n\nThe issue depicted in the film may seem a little dated (the story takes place in 2001) but it is nonetheless an important issue to discuss. The movie is somewhat aware of this as there are constant references to the fact that The Boston Globe could have exposed this issue of priests molesting children years ago and it is a mystery why they did not.\n\nMost people would probably describe the film as being slow-paced, to which I would respond that the movie wouldn't accomplish anything more than if it was edited to have a faster pace. This film needs to fill the audience in on details, and the audience is aware of that. It allows the audience to get the full impact of what is at issue here if we follow the journalists' investigation step by step.\n\nSpotlight has an ensemble cast of A-list actors including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and John Slattery, who all deliver great performances. I predict that Ruffalo will be nominated as Best Supporting Actor for the second year in a row. There is a moment in the film when his character has to show determination and frustration simultaneously as his suggestion is denied by Keaton's character, and at this point in the story we are forced to side with Ruffalo and the scene is heartbreaking.\n\nWhile the cast as a whole is great, we only get tiny insights into other characters' motivations and perspectives, but these glimpses still illustrate who the characters are perfectly. For example, one of the team members realize there is a pedophile priest living just a block away from him, and his first thought is to protect the children of the area. He cannot warn the children, however, until the story is released, once again making us question the decisions made by the executives at The Boston Globe.\n\nMy last comment is that this film is never visually interesting, but political dramas like this are not meant to be great works of art; rather, they are meant to create a cohesive story with well- developed characters to root for, and the film does exactly that and more. These types of film rely on realism, and while they are not necessarily documentaries, they need to inform us of real-world issues, and Spotlight never fails at doing so.\n\n4.0/4.0"

        "review_detailed_main": "Shades of Woodward and Bernstein, the based-on-a-true story Spotlight follows the actions of an investigative journalism team way out on a limb in Catholic Boston. They're not just in pursuit of the story of clergy child sex abuse, their mission is also to expose the shameful cover-up of abusive priests, and the institutional shortcomings that allowed them to carry on. Unlike today's social media blowhards (and political candidates), they can't just make accusations; they need actual proof. A nice coincidence is the support the reporters receive from another Ben Bradlee\u2014this one Ben Bradlee, Jr., played by John Slattery, who never has a good hair day. Like his father in the Watergate era, he lets the reporters run, even though he's initially skeptical they'll come up with anything. Crusading journalists are a social corrective we have largely lost in the era of declining newsroom budgets and staffs and the competition for sound bites and snarky bits. The reporters in this film reporters fill the job description, pushed by a fierce desire to expose the truth. Sometimes, of course, that leads to more truth than they might desire\u2014closer to home truths of different kinds. They're after the kind of story that wins Pulitzers, but more important to the journalists, they know it's an important story for the affected families and a sobering story about how evil can hide in plain sight. The principals include the Boston Globe's new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) and his investigative \"Spotlight\" team, led by Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton of the pursed lips), with reporters Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo, who sticks his head out like a turtle, so eager is he to grab onto the story), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachael McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian D'Arcy James). The actors do a fine job, as do Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup in smaller roles. As written by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer and directed by McCarthy, the film is a \"magnificent nerdy process movie\u2014a tour de force of filing cabinet cinema,\" says Justin Chang in Variety. Yet it is never uninteresting. Even better, it is never sanctimonious. The film's tension comes from fear that the Church will find out what the Globe is up to and exert its considerable influence to put a stop to it or\u2014and almost worse from the reporters' point of view\u2014the Boston Herald will scoop them. If they can delay publication until they have proof top Church leaders knew about the abuse, it would be impossible for them to persist in the \"few bad apples\" claim. In sum, \"A taut story, well-told,\" says Jim Lane in the Sacramento News & Review."

        "review_detailed_main": "So, this film raises a good question: should the genre of a film be taken into account when considering the overall quality?\n\nI understand that for the horror genre, it's generally well accepted that dumb characters and logic gaps are par for the course. The reason being that most people don't take horror too seriously, especially in the mainstream market. So with that in mind, does this film cement the standard for the \"journalism\" genre as one which requires no real direction or anything even remotely exceptional on a visual level? The blocking, cinematography, and art direction feel just flat out lazy and uninspired. All the scenes are constructed as though it were a Star Wars prequel. Just have a couple of characters stand around and talk to each other, and to spice it up we'll have them walk to a different part of the office. No effort is made to arrange the characters or the camera in a creative way which makes any scene distinguishable from the others.\n\nSo of course a natural counter to these complaints would be that the film is portraying the story with the realism it requires. The idea is that it's showing the journalists doing their jobs without exaggeration or sensationalist elements. It should be as it actually happened. May I ask though, in what way the plot would be seriously altered by creative cinematography or having the characters do something interesting while they're having dialogue? The lines don't have to change. The sequence of events don't have to change. The screenplay doesn't even really have to change. The director simply has to put in the effort to make it look even just a little bit interesting. Why not have a scene where one of the characters is putting together a jigsaw puzzle while the other is pacing around the room try to solve their own mental puzzle? I know that example is kind of dumb but it's a simple change that I think would make just about any scene in this film more interesting. Of course if it's shot in the same flat style as the rest of it then there wouldn't be much of a difference.\n\nI want to clarify that I don't think this film is bad. It's just not really exceptional. If you like it then that's fine. There are things to like about it. The point I'm trying to make is that this is a film and not a radio drama. It takes more then having your actors stand there, having them recite some logistical dialogue, and call it good. Just because this film is about journalism doesn't mean that it just has to be people talking and nothing else. If you don't want to tarnish this story with the utilization of film making techniques then maybe you shouldn't bother with adapting it to begin with. Since this story was adapted into film however, I am going to consider it the same way I would consider any other film. As such it is not very good. It's okay. That's it. There is no excuse for mediocrity in film, whatever the story. Spotlight doesn't get a free pass because it's about reporters.\n\nWouldn't really recommend it."

The direction Tom McCarthy took by making these reporters seem like everyday people made this movie not feel like a movie. It felt like I was actually watching reporters unearth this crazy scandal as it went on. There is no sugarcoating or loud scenes where the actors seem to give their Oscar moment. Everyone is incredibly restrained and it's this simplicity which makes Spotlight feel so real. The story itself is very engaging. As the film went on and more secrets got revealed, I was shocked every time and couldn't believe how this was a true story. The editing is terrific as there isn't a boring moment. I was so interested in the story that I couldn't believe how quickly 2 hours went by. I do think the soundtrack could have been better.\n\nThe performances are outstanding. Everyone is incredibly restrained and reacts in a way that seems very genuine. It's great to see Michael Keaton deliver another great performance after his success with Birdman. Mark Ruffalo gives one of his best, Rachel McAdams is also great and Liev Schrieber is fantastic. All the cast members seemed believable in their roles and added to the authenticity of the story.\n\nWhilst Spotlight is an intriguing watch, I don't feel the need to watch it again but I would definitely recommend it as I think it's worth your time."

        "review_title": "A film so low-key and subtle you might mistake it for another adult drama in a saturated market",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Spotlight\"'s pervasive casual attitude and laidback presentation as a film almost effectively undermine two things - how uniformly solid the acting is all around and how terrific of a film this really is. Reminiscent of Danny Boyle's \"Steve Jobs\" last month in that it's a film that focuses on a lot of decidedly smaller, human moments that make up the entirety of the project, \"Spotlight\" is a film that, unless you really look at it from various angles in its acting, storytelling, and pacing, you might mistake it for just another drama in a sea of adult entertainment this holiday season.\n\nThe film revolves around The Boston Globe newsroom, specifically the Spotlight team, a division of about four field reporters who choose a topic apart from a great deal of media attention and devote months of investigation in order to give an elaborate, in-depth story on it in a future paper. The team is comprised of Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (Michael Keaton), the veteran of the group who often acts as the leader, Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), a young, persistent journalist, Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), the woman responsible for undergoing difficult interviews that largely involve cold-approaching people, and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James), a family man who does a great deal of the team's research.\n\nIn response to the paper's slumping readership despite being acquired by The New York Times years earlier, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) is brought into make adjustments where needed. Upon arrival, he more or less directs the Spotlight team to focus their attention on the Boston archdiocese and the prevalent cases of molestation and sexual abuse involving priests and minors in the Catholic Church. Once the group begins to dive in and investigate, they realize the scope of the case is much greater and more impacting than any of them imagined, and also learn that The Globe had a great deal of this information at their disposal years ago but sat on their hands instead of covering it.\n\n\"Spotlight\" takes a fascinatingly relaxed approach to this story, focusing on the breezy conversations and etiquette in a newsroom. Boston Globe's Spotlight team proves that, while investigative journalism has the ability to shake an entire nation, it's also criminally underfunded, much like watchdog journalism, which both find themselves largely segregated on the secondary sources of the internet in the present day. This sort of very nonchalant vibe does wonders when \"Spotlight\" inevitably turns emotional, specifically when Michael and Sacha find themselves interviewing former victims of priests who have lived with the hell and uncertainty of their troubled childhood experiences.\n\nMuch like a well-written news article, \"Spotlight\" has the ability to infuriate in a manner that doesn't derail the project into manipulative territory. A large portion of the film is devoted to the meticulous practices of contemporary journalistic investigations in a way that really shows the talky, but elaborate process of interviewing. Americans, many of whom can't go a day without picking up a newspaper or reading a webpage or an email telling them the day's events, often do not consider what goes into the stories we read and take for granted each day; \"Spotlight\" not only showcases the impact the stories can have, but also shows the most important parts of the newsgathering process in a way that is gripping without being bombastic.\n\nThe lax attitude and approach writers Thomas McCarthy (also director) and Josh Singer almost disguises the attention to acting and character development on display here. Michael Keaton hits another home-run with his human portrayal of Walter Robinson, largely because his character, unlike Riggen Thomson in \"Birdman\" last year, is never too dramatic or out of his own element. Meanwhile, Mark Ruffalo does a great job at being both a younger journalist and a likable one; not a smug nor self-serious jokester who ostensibly stumbled into the job as generic Hollywood roles would traditionally have it, Rachel McAdams delivers some of the strongest and most compelling work of her career thanks to her realistic portrayal of her character, and the same goes for Brian d'Arcy James.\n\n\"Spotlight\" doesn't look to shortchange any of these characters nor play them to predictable types. Walter isn't the kind of veteran journalist who screams and shouts whenever he doesn't get his way, Michael isn't the lackadaisical bloke who doesn't take his work seriously, Sacha isn't the ditsy journalist who needs to constant be reminded her job comes with a big responsibility, Matt isn't a stiff-as-a-board moralist, and Marty isn't the evil corporate downsizer looking to corrupt the integrity of The Globe (not openly, at least). None of these characters pander to conventional archetypes and perhaps that, much like the strength of the film's approach, will be lost upon audiences who do not actively notice it at first.\n\nFinally, McCarthy directs \"Spotlight\" with humble interjections of style; consider a key telephone interview being the subject of a medium-length take that has all the members of the Spotlight team hovered around a phone. McCarthy's camera focuses on the telephone before slowly pulling back the camera to reveal the entire team, and then pulling even further back down a hallway to minimize the size of the team. This interview really establishes the scope of the Catholic Church's unforgivable crimes, and this effort to showcase how small this team is in the face of this huge issue is a nice way to capture the film with an unwritten thesis, and investigative journalism in a nutshell. Everything in \"Spotlight\" that's so brilliantly done is so quietly captured that it's almost as if it's designed for you to miss. With that, I'd advise you to watch it like you would read a gripping news article: with intent to focus and read between the lines, even the headlines."

Dramatization is not a necessarily a bad thing in films, a little more scenes who are audience oriented would have made this movie more interesting and overall better.\n\nIn other aspects, it's great movie, the actors, script, directing but it's not Network (1976), Ace in the Hole (1951) and All the President's Men (1976)."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 2002, The Boston Globe ran a series of articles covering a history of child molestation occurring inside the Catholic Church. It shocked the world, resulting in a Pulitzer Prize for the newspaper, while forever tarnishing the public perception of priests everywhere. The film Spotlight, directed by Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, Win- Win), recounts the story of the Globe's investigation, with a star-studded cast and a commitment to historical clarity. It is an extremely faithful procedural that offers a thoroughly intriguing, and sobering, dramatic experience.\n\nThe film's heroes are four journalists working for Spotlight, a small and specialized investigative team of the Boston Globe. Mark Ruffalo, Rachel Mcadams, John d'Arcy James, and Michael Keaton all give excellent performances as these team members, though excellent is just par for the course with Spotlight, as every role in the film is entirely convincing. Each character is given just enough believable depth to avoid dipping into clich\u00e9, an impressive feat when considering the size of this cast.\n\nIn fact, calling the members of Spotlight \"heroes\" doesn't seem appropriate, as they feel less like valiant white knights of a righteous cause, and more like actual people. They each have their own set of personal responsibilities to deal with, both familial and social, and do their best to not have it effect their work.\n\nThere is a great sense of place in Spotlight, and Catholic Church's authority in Boston is ever-present. A character early on in the film mentions that although the city's population is large, Boston is still a very small town, and the cinematography reflects this idea beautifully. Exterior shots will often times have cathedrals appearing in the background as a looming reminder of how integral and all-encompassing the Catholic Religion is to Boston. It may seem a bit obvious and trite, but one Google Maps search for \"Boston churches\" will net more results then \"Boston Starbucks\". This is not some underhanded attempt at symbolism, it would just be near impossible to find a shooting location in Boston where a church isn't in the background.\n\nMcCarthy seems intent on holding the film to a strict level of naturalism. All of the dialogue feels functional and direct, lacking the traditional levity expected in the prose of most major releases. There is a professionalism in the way people speak that goes far in establishing the authenticity of the newspaper office setting.\n\nThere's also a clear effort to show journalism in the sort of grounded, realistic way not found outside season 5 of The Wire. You aren't likely to see many eureka moments of revelatory discoveries, or impassioned speeches set to obtrusive score. Any swelling emotional moments are few and far between, and instead the film opts to portray the profession in a more genuine light, as a job. As the tedious and methodical collection of information, over a long period of time, that slowly accumulates into a big story. A nine-to-five trek that requires equal levels of passion and caffeine.\n\nI'm worried that some might interpret this as a very dull approach for a feature film, but that's because Spotlight won't hold an audience's hand or accommodate any lack of interest. It doesn't so much demand attention, as much as it requires it. It's a film for adults. Not because it's rated R, but because it approaches its hefty topics with maturity and intelligence, and expects the same level of both from the viewer."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember when this story broke back in 2002. It quickly became a huge story that spread all around the globe. As unthinkable as it seemed in the beginning, the mountain of evidence that built up, not only in Boston, but the rest of the world, showed everyone that people we trust, people we see as friends and guardians, have sexually abused children by the thousands.\n\nThis happens right there, right in front of us. Powerful people know about it, and powerful people help covering it up. Lawyers, police, politicians, journalists, priests, u name it.\n\nIt is absolute horror, and a story that needs to be told and understood. For how can this even be possible?. We live in what we call modern societies, where no one is left alone, where everyone has rights, where everyone will get help if needed. But this world did not exist for the children that are victims of this conspiracy.\n\nIt is almost ironical that 9/11 happens right in the center of this story, and that the story is about people not paying attention, about people not doing what is needed to seek out the truth, especially to respect the victims of these crimes.\n\nCan conspiracies truly happen on such large scales?. Without \"anyone\" knowing about it?. Yes, it can. And even worse, people that we trust and believe in cover it up, and try to hide the truth.\n\nThousands upon thousands of children abused, systematically, for years, by hundreds of priests, all over the world. Children. Our children. On our watch.\n\nThis is a strong film, actually the best film i have seen this year, with \"The Big Short\" as number two. Which also show how a corrupt system works behind our backs, taking what we own, only to get richer and more powerful themselves.\n\nWho is the system?. It starts to look like our leaders and our masters, our politicians, who we elect, all are a part of a corrupt system, that works together, and that we, normal people are being farmed, so to speak. Is what I'm saying far fetched? I bet more and more people start to understand that this might be true, but to explain how it works, is very very difficult.\n\nThe film explains how the Boston globe started out investigating one priest, and then just to reveal more and more cases, more victims, and then connecting child abuse to more and more priest. And as the story grows, the horror becomes real. It is a remarkable script, and the direction is steadfast.\n\nAll actors in this film gives rock solid and some really remarkable performances, but my hats off to Mark Ruffalo. Again we see him at the top of his game, he is so good at what he does, i believe every second of what he delivers. Just like in \"Zodiac\" and \"Foxcatcher\" to mention a few.\n\nThis movie got Oscar for best motion picture a few days ago, well deserved, and it also got the Oscar for best screenplay. As i also predicted, but not giving best supporting actor to Mark Ruffalo, was not the right decision IMO.\n\nSee this movie everyone, it is an outstanding film, with very few flaws. It is a film that grips you the very first minute, and never lets go. It's a story about crimes we could not even dream of, not in the world we live in. And it needs to be told, understood and retold. Again and again and again.\n\n9/10 - Very Good"

It therefore belongs very much in the category of movies you have to see rather than you want to see. As is common with a lot of cases of this nature the perpetrators escape justice. The Boston Globe have to try and expose exactly what is going on.\n\nThe script and acting are exceptional. the film undoubtedly leaves a lasting impression. In common with Schindlers List Spotlight is a film that I am glad that I watched, but have no intention of watching again."

Everyone who watches the six o'clock news, buys a paper or scrolls through Facebook knows roughly what happened.\n\nIt makes it all the more confusing then, when a story like this is thrown onto the big screen, and told in an agonisingly straight style. By this I mean, there isn't anything new here, the production isn't groundbreaking or cutting edge, there are no boundaries being pushed to help cinema float into the future. They didn't bring anything to the table, attempts at building suspense are short lived - with bottoms hardly having enough time to get to the edge of the seats.\n\nThe performances are passionate, but let down by a textbook (not in a good way) approach to the cinematography, it leaves it feeling distinctly flat. If they were dealing with a more unknown story, it could have been effective. There are some examples of this, letting the camera on, being calm in the face of evil that work. Joshua Oppenheimer's 2012 documentary \"The Act of Killing\" - exploits this flat style to further sicken the audience. Jumping back to \"Spotlight\", a story this big needing some more sting in its tail? Just to make people wonder about the things our species are capable of? It's pretty worrying.\n\nI know what you're thinking, \"it's supposed to be black and white, hype and tension would only look like fear mongering...\" You're right. But! Film is still just a medium for storytelling, and there is an art to it. Poor retelling numbs the story, and this one cannot be overlooked.\n\nTake it back to post-production Tom McCarthy..."

The issue was known, but Spotlight highlights the story of the brave men and women who had to invest copious amounts of effort just to tell the world about it. This movie is brilliant all across the board: the performances, the cinematography, the story, the dialogue, the direction, and just about everything in-between. If you're Catholic, please understand this movie is NOT an attack on Catholocism, but mainly a film exploiting a systemic issue in the Catholic Church. If anything, Catholics should be more outraged than the rest of us, but I digress. Spotlight is a beautifully realized film with a very obvious amount of blood, sweat and tears put into it. From the geographic accuracy of Boston and other areas around it, to the details of the story, to the portrayals of the characters, Spotlight is a nigh-flawless product that not only excels on a technical level, but is going to have relevance for many generations to come."

        "review_detailed_main": "The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.\n\nGoing into awards season, \"Spotlight\" was the early front-runner. And after the nominees were announced, it has remained a favorite. More than a handful of award nominations surround it, and we should expect it will get at least one, if not a few.\n\nWill it get an award for best screenplay? Certainly it has the chops to do so, as it has made journalism interesting again, the first film to do since since \"All the President's Men\". And it addresses the Boston clergy scandal in a fair way. This is not a smear campaign, but an honest look. Even the Church itself has accepted and praised the film. Vatican Radio, official radio service of the Holy See, called it \"honest\" and \"compelling\" and said it helped the Catholic Church \"to accept fully the sin, to admit it publicly, and to pay all the consequences.\" Luca Pellegrini on the Vatican Radio website wrote that the Globe reporters \"made themselves examples of their most pure vocation, that of finding the facts, verifying sources, and making themselves\u2014for the good of the community and of a city\u2014paladins of the need for justice.\"\n\nThere are two acting awards to look at. Michael Keaton was projected to be nominated, but was not. In his place, we have two supporting actors: mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams. For whatever reason, the actress roles year after year are generally not very strong, and this may allow McAdams to sneak by. She is not outstanding by any means, but better than her usual self. But Jennifer Jason Leigh seems to be the front-runner, and Rooney Mara is also someone to watch. This is not your year, Rachel.\n\nMark Ruffalo has a better shot. He has gone all out, and this may be his finest performance yet. For a guy who appeared in such films as \"13 Going on 30\", he has really distinguished himself. The intensity here. There is one clear \"Oscar scene\" where Ruffalo stands up to Keaton's character. His biggest hurtle, though, will probably be Mark Rylance (\"Bridge of Spies\"). They are two very different performances, but the Academy's tendency to give out \"lifetime achievement awards\" makes me suspect it will tip in Rylance's favor.\n\nTom McCarthy as best director? Clearly if a film can be best picture the director deserves a chance to be best director. The two are almost always linked. But McCarthy has a strike against him: the Adam Sandler film \"The Cobbler\". Are people ready to forget about that? Probably. But yet, it seems like Inarritu (\"The Revenant\") may be taking this one... for the second year in a row, if memory serves me.\n\nNow, of course, that leaves best picture. As noted, the hype is there, the push is there, if you were involved in an Oscar pool this would be the wise bet. For me, it is a fight between \"Spotlight\" and \"The Martian\". But I probably stands alone on that, and the reason is because \"Spotlight\" is the more important film.\n\n\"The Martian\" is a hopeful story, but \"Spotlight\" focuses on the importance of journalism and standing up for what is right. The film is even more important today than when the scandal happened because of the Internet. And they hint at that in one scene where a priest tells his congregation that the Internet cannot make faith obsolete. The real message is that the Internet cannot make good journalism obsolete. Papers may be shutting down or merging, but good reporting will always have its place... and thank goodness we have the folks at Spotlight to do that sort of work for us."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I'm just a poor boy from a poor family\" says one of the victims of systematically covered up child abuse by paedophile Priests in Boston \"and when a priest pays attention to you, it's a big deal. How do you say 'no' to God?\"\n\nThe victim might well have added, as I did, subconsciously, the paraphrased words of Freddie Mercury \"spare me my life from this monstrosity.\"\n\nBecause let's make no mistake here. This was a monstrosity.\n\nThe story is, on the surface, a journalistic procedural about the 'exposing' (no pun intended) of paedophile priests in Massachusetts (Boston specifically) by The Boston Globe's 'Spotlight' tiny hit squad at the turn of the millennium. The investigation is set into motion at the instruction of the ailing paper's then Editor, Marty Baron, played with callous inscrutability by Liev Scriver. It's a masterful performance.\n\nOr at least that's how the movie's billed. In actual fact it becomes a complete deconstruction of the 'Three Estates' and commentary on their deep rooted self protection; the clergy, the news industry, the legal sector, the monied are all systematically pulverised in Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy's acid script.\n\nNo one comes out alive.\n\nIncluding, tragically, many of the thousand and more victims of this institutionalised psychological 'phenomenon' that is peculiar to a significant minority (6% apparently) of the Catholic clergy, not just in Boston Massachusetts, but the first world over.\n\nThat's why this film is so important, because as we bemoan the effect of Islamic fundamentalism of the World order right now the Christian religion has been breeding just as insidious an evil, but from within and of its own, for decades (maybe, no probably, longer. As the movie opens it quickly becomes apparent that Spotlight is a commercial indulgence in the context of falling newsprint sales and the fledgling 'internet' bringing with it, as it did, almost unlimited free 24 hour news. The new editor, with a reputation for cutting the workforce elsewhere, initially looks at Spotlight (a team of four) with scepticism.\n\nThey grow their stories at leisure and have an unhealthily parochial attitude towards them. They look set for the chop until Baron learns of a priest who's been exposed and thinks it's a story for the Spotlight team. Apart from eager beaver, Mike Rezendez (another magnificent performance by the chameleon-like Mark Ruffalo) they're initially reluctant because they know the city 'mafia' (it's strongly Catholic and protects its own) will not make the task easy and could, in fact, boycott the title if the accusations are distasteful.\n\nThe Spotlight team go for it with vigour. The meat of the film gradually excavates the layers of deceit,and cover up executed by the Archbishop, his cronies and the legal profession who carry out extensive, but not particularly elaborate burial of evidence, misfiling of case reports and the turning of blind eyes right left and centre.\n\nThe police are implicated (no, accused) the most senior judiciary (some of them also Catholic) subvert and seal important files.\n\nFrankly, the whole thing sucks.\n\nAnd then 9/11 strikes, suddenly the world's eyes turn to Islam, including Spotlights'.\n\nHow ironic.\n\nIt's a tragic intervention in many ways because the team is making real progress; extracting victim stories from grown men, mainly but not exclusively, that agree to tell their stories and closing ion on the legal, clergy and city movers and shakers that are at the heart of the cover up.\n\nBut eventually the case resumes and we reach our inevitable and well publicised finale.\n\nWhat Tom McCathy has achieved here is turn a movie into a fly on the wall docudrama, shot , as it is, in unglamourous fluorescent light for the most part. The lead performances by Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton and John Slattery are selfless. Spotlight is bigger than any of them. ( A special mention must also go to Stanley Tucci for playing the lawyer with a heart in an award worthy turn.)\n\nThe script is a whodunit of epic proportions and the content is both worthwhile and necessary and the sum is most certainly greater than the parts.\n\nPraise to the real Spotlight team was ultimately massive (they won the Pulitzer prize for their efforts) but the impact it has had as it has resonated across not just the Boston Globe but its entirety makes this an effort of monumental proportions and the basis of a truly great movie that should win best picture at the 2016 Academy Awards."

Among the various departments is the investigative small unknown SPOTLIGHT. Its overseen by Michael Keatons character. In his department is the outstanding Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Mcadams. While working a case they are alerted to a story alleging rampant abuse of children by a local priest. Intrigued they begin investigating, slowly uncovering victims and learning that higher members of the Church conspired to keep things quiet. The film, like the investigation, reveals secrets little by little, keeping you fully engrossed in the story. The script is helped by an amazing cast. Ruffalo seems Oscar bound here.

The story itself is really an interesting story. The pacing of the movie is fluid and it never bored me. Every time there was a break in the case, a rush of excitement hit me. I'm glad they didn't focus too much time on 9/11, as I was afraid it would just kill all the momentum it had been rolling up the whole way. The performances of everyone, especially Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton, were great. Liev Schreiber was a commanding presence in the movie as well, with his quiet, but almost intimidating role as the main editor.\n\nBut other than the great acting and an interesting plot, nothing really is special about the movie. The movie is boring to just look at visually. No colors stand out in a wash of grey, white, and black. I get that maybe it's because duh newspaper, but it is not a movie for spectacle. The camera work was really boring as well. No interesting shots or composition were to be seen in the whole film. I watched it maybe 3 days ago and I can't, for the life of me, remember any scene vividly.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Spotlight\" (2015 release; 128 min.) brings the true story of how the Boston Globe eventually broke the story of the widespread abuse of young children by Boston priests while the Catholic Church stood by and covered it up. As the movie opens, we are in \"Boston, MA - 1976\", where we see a priest being accused of abuse. \"Wait until the arraignment, the press will be all over it\", comments one cop. \"What arraignment?\", replies the other cop. We then fast-forward to \"July, 2001\", and we get to know the 4 member Spotlight, an investigative reporting team at the Boston Globe. The Globe also has just gotten a new editor, Marty Baron, \"an unmarried Jewish guy who doesn't like baseball\" (the implication being he's no fit for Boston). But it's not long before Baron picks up on a recent column about abuse by Boston priests, and he orders Spotlight to look into it. At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer and sometimes director Tom McCarthy (he won an Oscar for writing \"UP\"), and I have to say, \"Spotlight\" is the giant leap forward as a director, and he has now placed himself in the upper ranks of today's directors. The trick with these movies is: how can the director brings a movie, whose outcome we already know going in, and still capture our attention? It was the same question faced by the makers of \"All The President's Men\", of course, and in fact \"Spotlight\" very much reminds me of \"All The President's Men\": top-notch all the way, and it feels like a thriller as you're watching it. At one point, someone comments \"it takes a village to raise a child, and it takes a village to abuse a child\", pinpointing the collective failing of all of Boston for so many years. The abuse of power and influence of the Catholic Church is simply appalling. Kudos to the various performers, including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachael McAdams, Stanley Tucci, and Liev Schreiber, just to name those. They all bring powerful performances. Last but not least, there is a nice orchestral score from Hollywood veteran composer Howard Shore. If \"Spotlight\" does somewhat okay at the box office, I think that this movie will be in line for a bunch of nominations and even awards in the upcoming awards season.\n\nThe movie recently opened nationally in the theater. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Ft. Myers, FL was reasonably attended but by no means a sell-out. I truly hope that this movie finds an audience, not just because it covers an important issue but most of all because it is one heck of a movie. IF you liked \"All the President's Men\", drop everything and go see this. \"Spotlight\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

The story stops with the publication of the scandal with names and other victims contacting the newspaper team. The screenplay, direction and performances are top-notch.

        "review_detailed_main": "The world is filled with secrets. Everybody have their own, but usually they are quite small and do not interfere with others. However, this can only be applicable to ordinary mortals. When an important man or even a big institution are involved, things get ugly before they get beautiful. Nowadays we have plenty examples to support that, and when a well intention guy or group try to dive into this deep waters, things usually become disagreeable.\n\nSpotlight is one of these cases. The story here is about a true story of how a research journalist group named Spotlight, working for the Boston Globe, uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core, the Vatican. Although the majority of the young people are not well familiar with this scandal, it really shacked and shocked everyone and had repercussions beyond the expectations. Therefore, some courage is needed to direct a story of this magnitude. So, and thinking that the film was extremely well produced, I would like to underline the amazing job of the Director Tom McCarthy. He really did it! This incredible and complex true story is properly treated in this movie, with all the sequence making sense, guiding us throw the complexity of the research made by these brave guys. Complex in every matters, because it involved pure journalism, intricate laws, important people, huge institutions. And Tom McCarthy presented all in a very simple way that make us understand everything from the beginning until the end without missing a bit. This movie is really about the story and everything is there!\n\nRegarding the actors' performance not much can be said, once the brilliance of the movie relies on the story itself, so all the credits should be attributed to the team who have written and directed the movie. However, if someone must be mentioned, Mark Ruffalo (Mike Rezendes) is that guy. He is one of the journalists involved in the research for the Boston Globe and slowly get into the subject and began to be slightly affected about it. Actually, all the team, began to demonstrate signs of disturbed behavior as the research proceeds, which is quite normal regarding the atrocity that they were exposing. He is one of the main stones of the group and is responsible for a few interesting scenes. His character evolves in the movie and Mark really manages to convey all the interior pain that he is feeling.\n\nWith all that said I have scored this brilliant movie with a 9/10 because it really captured one of the most controversial scandals of all time. Besides all the time passed, this could be a story of today once a lot of speculation still exists. Incredible job for everyone but as I have said, this is a movie that depends exclusively of the story without any shining performance. However, it will capture all your attention during the entire time. I truly recommended it."

        "review_detailed_main": "(As e-mailed to relatives and attorney friends.)\n\nI rented a Blu-ray disc of the movie. Albeit I held on to it for days and then I had to pay almost ten bucks in accrued rental fee, because I've been busy and am quite lazy when it comes to priority of watching movies at home.\n\nWhile the movie Spotlight is well-made, it's not exceptional and it's a standard movie. It feels like a slickly produced HBO movie at times.\n\nI would expect this movie to bash Catholic religion, but it's more restrained. But why this story needed to be told in movie form is a bit strange, given the topic.\n\nI enjoyed Zodiac and The Insider, based on true stories, and these are far superior compared to this movie that plays like a \"TV-M\" Hallmark movie.\n\nThe reason why I mention this movie to you is two reasons: the rare topics that relate to lawyering and journalism.\n\nBut given the precedents like the aforementioned favorite movies I cited above, Spotlight isn't that fantastic.\n\nSpotlight won Oscars for Best Picture and Best original Screenplay, and I think Best Picture is unwarranted, but I also thought script was very good that held the movie well for two hours instead of three long, almost drab hours.\n\nI recommend the movie just for brief lawyer \"mumbo jumbo\" if that will pique your interest how movie depict lawyering.\n\nIn my opinion, Spotlight is overrated but a tad respectful in its sensitive treatment on the controversial topic involving sex abuse within Catholic church.\n\nOne thing I disagree with is the given MPAA rating that gave this movie an R rating. It should be PG-13, but the MPAA thought the subject is too mature, so they automatically gave it an R rating, for adult themes alone, besides brief language and relevant sexual abuse references.\n\nMPAA is really out of touch. In my opinion, for example, The Insider should have gotten a PG13 rating, despite some language. It's a relatively \"bloodless\" movie but still great."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"What do you know?\" It's a simple question that is asked nonchalantly in the beginning of the film, but a question that holds heavy over us as we begin to question who knows what. In 2001, the Boston Globe began a piece on the countless uncovered molestation cases within the local Catholic Archdiocese. Using the papers Spotlight investigative team, the Globe would go on to expose and reveal the immense corruption that riddled the churches, rocking the foundation of the entire Catholic community. Heading the Spotlight team is Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), who with fellow journalists Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy Robinson) begin unfolding the layers of sexual abuse that have gone ignored and unheeded for almost thirty years. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent) creates a meditative film with dark roots that builds up a steady pulse, knowing when to pace itself as to keep from exhausting its subject matter. The offices of the Boston Globe lay thick with a soft, pastel hue that hearkens a commonality within the paper, prominently citing the latest Red Sox game with no real focus on journalistic content. It's a view that runs parallel to the Catholic Churches flippant behavior, tossing aside anything paramount that might disrupt the nature of things. Howard Shore (A History of Violence) works to emphasize the immediacy within each scene, as he creates what becomes background noise; it's a score that glides rather than soars, which is exactly what our focus needs. We witness what is only important to the story, to what's being investigated as we follow in front of our journalists; when they move the story we move.\n\nUnwrapping each layer of the investigation brings a different shade to the Spotlight team, with the sympathetic core stemming from Mark Ruffalo's Mike, who presses matters with an urgent and motivated hand that stands out amongst saltine performances from the rest of the Spotlight team. Ruffalo makes Mike his own, embodying a demeanor and emotion that helps shed light into the heart of the scandals while fidgeting and insisting his way around the city. There's a sense of flaccidness that permeates within the remaining Spotlight team, as findings are read and reports are exclaimed, though the only sense is urgency and necessity. The pace is urgent thanks in part to Tom McArdle (Station Agent), who never quite rests on a scene too long before cutting to the streets, then back to the office. It's an arrangement that spotlights the necessity of bringing this scandal to light, but along the way refuses to shine much focus on the grief, a choice that is both mindful of its perpetrators yet neglectful of its victims. Spotlight is a small film posturing as something bigger, highlighting a momentous period in journalism and the Catholic community that can't quite reach the pinnacle of cinematic storytelling, leaving us knowing a lot yet feeling little."

You say 'WHAT?! You don't find people in the church raping young children finally being exposed by a local newspaper move you in anyway?!\" The real-life story/subject matter, yes... but NOT this film.\n\nIf your \"enjoyment\" is just observing a depiction of what we already knew and was established, then this is for you.\n\nThere really are no satisfying or shocking moments/ending. What you see is what you already know... you don't really get anything out of it. The journey does not flow well. How can anyone find this movie \"shocking\" when we already knew about the premise and it really adds nothing new to it? I mean, for a movie like TITANIC, we KNOW the ship is going to sink, but the EXPERIENCE of the film made it worthwhile. Spotlight fails on the EXPERIENCE. It is as boring as observing a meeting at an office.\n\nFor this to win an Oscar just meant they like to give awards to the 'underdog' or just simply because of the controversy subject matter.\n\nThis film is on the same level as when 'The Artist' won Oscar - another overrated boring film (probably forgotten by most people by now; as much as I can enjoy black and white films) - which just simply won more for the IDEA than the quality of the film.\n\nSkip it."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Spotlight\" so far for this year does hold up as one of the most powerful and stronger movies of this year. It's supported and held together by an all-star and all pro cast of film veterans like Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and John Slattery. The film is based on the true and real life story of the Boston Globe's investigation into the uncovering of the massive scandal of the cover- up that the local catholic Archdiocese did within the city. And this would involve the abuse and sexual molestation of mostly young boys. As one by one older men start to remember and recount the gone by years that they were prey and taken advantage of by high ranking religious figures of the church as it's revealing to see how the young, innocent, and lonely are hit so hard. Upon the the investigation by the newspaper team it is found how the cover-up was at all levels from not only just the church but in the form of the legal system and local and federal government as the cases were often kept quite or thrown out or settled out of court. Along the way the team does draining work of digging for information and asking questions of the high powered in the city as Robby(Michael Keaton)the lead hunter and Sacha(Rachel McAdams)are the tag team of reporters that gather the most revealing information. Overall this picture is informative and investigative as it does shed light on scandal and corruption showing that the powerful must be held accountable and it proves that religious leaders are often a massive greed scandal and a work of moral decay as the hierarchy loves to abuse their power and authority. Overall \"Spotlight\" is a real eye opening film that searches and finds answers as it's a showcase of accountability proving that light must be shined on those in power."

It stars Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Liev Schreiber, Brian d'Arcy James and Stanley Tucci. The film tells the true story of the Boston Globe's 2001 'Spotlight' team of investigators, which uncovered decades of sexual abuse, towards minors, by Catholic priests; and the Church's cover-up of the crimes. The film deserves all of it's praise; it's one of the year's best!\n\nThe Boston Globe's 'Spotlight' team, is the longest running newspaper investigation team, in the US. In 2003, they earned the paper a 'Pulitzer Prize for Public Service'; for uncovering decades of child molestation abuse, involving 87 priests in Boston alone, and the Catholic Church's despicable cover-up of the crimes. This film tells that story; and it centers around journalists Walter Robinson (Keaton), Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), Ben Bradley Jr. (Slattery), Matt Carroll (James) and Marty Baron (Schreiber).\n\nThe film's cast is awesome; especially Keaton (who more than deserves another Oscar nomination, for his performance). The script is brilliant, and the directing is superb (which is a little odd, since McCarthy also co-wrote and directed 'THE COBBLER', earlier this year; which wasn't nearly as good). The movie isn't especially entertaining, or even greatly moving; but it is a very important film (and it's always involving and interesting to watch). Even the Catholic Church itself, has praised the movie; for it's honesty and compassionate treatment of the material. It's definitely a film everyone should see.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/dWmLQGusjEk"

        "review_title": "Reminds us of what investigative journalism used to be",
        "review_detailed_main": "Except for unrelenting bulldogs like Seymour Hersh (who had to publish his latest article outside of the U.S.), true investigative journalism seems to have become as obsolete as the 8-Track Tape. Tom McCarthy's (\"The Cobbler\") Spotlight, however, reminds us of what it was and what it still could be. Set in Boston, the film is named after the Pulitzer Prize winning investigative unit of The Boston Globe which, in the years following 9/11, investigated the abuse of children by parish priests and the link of silence that existed between the Catholic Church and the Boston political and business community. It was a silence that allowed offending priests off the hook for their crimes, being transferred from parish to parish where they often re-offended.\n\nIn the film which follows the journalistic procedural style of such classics as \"All the President's Men,\" Michael Keaton (\"Birdman\") is Globe Unit Editor Walter \"Robby\" Robinson. When the story circulates about the church's kid gloves treatment of molester Father John Goeghan, the paper's editor-in-chief Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber, \"Pawn Sacrifice\"), newly arrived from The Miami Herald and not bound by local \"traditions\" or religious loyalties, assigns the Spotlight unit to dig into the story. Robby and his team that consists of reporters Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo, \"Foxcatcher\"), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams, \"Southpaw\") and Marty Campbell (Brian d'Arcy James, \"Time Out of Mind\"), overseen by deputy managing editor Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery, \"Ant-Man\") set about the nitty-gritty work of tracking down the offending clerics.\n\nBaron, however, wants to expose the systemic corruption in the church, not just individual priests and guns for top church officials such as Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law (Len Cariou, \"Prisoners\"). While the case is being built step-by-step, the film shows how some leads go nowhere while others uncover a wider net than imagined. Coming up against the church's stonewalling, documents that have been made unavailable or have strangely disappeared, and a sleazy attorney in the D.A's office (Billy Crudup, \"The Stanford Prison Experiment\"), the team reaches out to Phil Saviano (Neal Huff, \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\") who heads an organization dedicated to supporting abuse victims as well as attorney Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci, \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1\") who represents victims that are suing the church in a class-action lawsuit and is an important source of information.\n\nIt is the interviews with the victims arranged by Garabedian that constitute some of the film's most moving moments. Especially touching is the story of Joe, beautifully performed by Michael Cyril Creighton (\"Sleeping With Other People\"), an openly gay man who looked up to the priest as the representative of God and felt flattered by the cleric's attention and the realization that it was okay to be gay but only later realized the priest's culpable behavior.\n\nOne of the film's best lines is when Garabedian, speaking of the agreement within the church to maintain their silence, says, \"If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse one.\" Another impactful scene delves into the mindset of one of the offenders. In Pfeiffer's interview of ex-priest Father Ronald Paquin (Richard O'Rourke, \"Ghost Town\"), he admits to \"fooling around\" with the boys but says he never derived any pleasure from it.\n\nUndoubtedly the boys did not derive much pleasure either. One psychologist claims the priests have remained emotional preadolescence, but this over-generalized speculation does not add much clarity to the debate. As the head of an outstanding ensemble cast, Michael Keaton performance has depth and sensitivity, Ruffalo brilliantly captures the almost obsessively focused dedication of Rezendes, and McAdams is able to astutely demonstrate empathy, allowing the subjects of her interviews to feel safe in expressing their feelings.\n\nMcCarthy delivers the story with restraint and a balanced approach, showing the indifference of Globe reporters who sat on pertinent information they had about the scandal many years ago. While Spotlight does not have much style and can drag, the strength of its performances and the clear presentation of its subject matter has a strong impact, allowing us to feel the pain of the children who still suffer the effects of abuse and reminds us that, as Kahlil Gibran put it, \"Safeguarding the rights of others is the most noble and beautiful end of a human being.\""

The movie has a lot of indoor scenes and a lot of conversation, which makes you think they would have no trouble turning it into a theater piece. The movie is nominated to the Oscars and that always puts a bit of extra pressure on it. After watching it, I don't feel it deserves an Oscar.

I cannot recall another film this year that so intelligently and without melodrama produces scene after scene that just leave you wanting to know more.\n\nThe all-star stellar cast is underpinned by Keaton, who seems to have proved he has had his comeback - here he focuses on a nicely underplayed performance, and Ruffalo, whose slightly off-kilter manner works to his advantage, and Rachel McAdams, who moves from romantic comedies to this with the ease and promise she showed in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris. There is not a dud moment in the film - it really is one of the best films about journalism, and ranks along with All The President's Men.\n\nAt the end of the day this is not just a great story, director Tom McCarthy, takes us along emotionally - but does so in such a forensic and well-judged manner that it produces a good mixture of trust and a measure of level-headedness. His script, with West Wings regular Josh Singer, is outstanding, simply the best script of the year that I can recall by quite a margin.\n\nOf all the films I've seen this year, this is the one that tackles its difficult subject with bravery, clarity, and simplicity, but it never loses sight of why it matters. I am a loss to understand why it is not on everyone's Oscar list."

The movie didn't really add anything new in that sense. Acting is good, as is the music, but not exceptional. Visually it's not stunning or especially interesting, no reason to go to the cinema to see it. No real turning points, exceptional dialogues, characters to identify with, emotional scenes. In fact, I found the movie boring at times. Overall a very good film, but really ridiculous it beat The Revenant for best picture. I guess it's a politically correct choice and maybe that suits a lot of people, because I didn't read a lot of complaints or bad reviews about this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight is a movie which is making you realize how dearly we should never surrender our freedom of the press.\n\nThis movie tells the real story of a team of 5 journalists working for the Boston Globe who, despite the deep willingness of the Church and their supporters to bury it, uncovers one of the biggest scandals which shook the entire planet: the scandalous and systematic cover up of priests molesting young children they were in charge of by the Catholic Church itself.\n\nIt all started with one case, then thirteen until it reached the chilling number of ninety priests molesting children during their entire career while people knew but turned their eyes because of all the good the Church was doing for the city.\n\nI was deeply shocked by the hypocrisy and real stiffness of this system for example when Rachel McAdams is interviewing that priest who admits the facts he's accused of but insists that it was not rape as he was raped himself. When the interview ended, while she walks down the stairs, she realizes that the priest lives nearby a school. What's even more shocking is the reaction of the Church towards the issue. They surely know of it but prefer to cover it up by hiding legal documents proving the rapes so nobody could gain access to it with the providential help of justice employees or even by frequently putting pressure on the journalists to protect the Church reputation.\n\nThis movie is also an ode to reporting throughout those 5 journalists who keep digging, tracking down each of the victims to get their chilling statements even risking some hardly gained friendships with defense attorneys to get to the truth. My compliment by the way to Jamey Sheridan who played one of those attorneys who was just doing his job despite being secretly disgusted by his clients abuses.\n\nSpotlight is a must see and it truly deserves its Oscar for the Best Picture of the year. And it deserves also the highest note to me. 10/10"

A new editor was brought in and budget cuts were coming. The team of the Spotlight section has just been given a new story to work on. The story deals with allegations of child abuse within the Catholic Church. What started off as a story with a few victims with one priest began to grow the more they dig. By the time they ran the story the victims and the number of priests grew to disgusting numbers, but it didn't stop there. This is a movie that makes you sick while you watch. This is another movie were everyone knows the outcome but that does nothing to make you furious with anger and want to scream at the TV. I don't want this to become too political or controversial so I won't go any further but I will say this is a movie you MUST WATCH. This movie is important and transcends the screen into true journalism and continues this needed conversation. I have seen 6 of the 8 Best Picture nominees for this year so far. This one jumped to the front of the line for me. Overall, a true must see movie and I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried at the end. This film will make you feel anger, disgust, gratitude and hope. Making you feel any one of them is the sign of a good movie, one that makes you feel all of them is the sign of a great movie that will be remembered. Watch this movie today. I easily give this an A+."

The film depicts their investigation into child sex abuse cases by numerous Catholic priests.\n\nThe four-person team consists of Walter (Michael Keaton), Mike (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha (Rachel McAdams), and Matt (Brian d'Arcy James). Liev Schreiber stars as the Boston Globe's new managing editor, Marty Baron, who suggests they \"go after the system\" instead of individual priests.\n\nTo uncover the story and obtain as much information as possible before going public, the team contacts and interviews many of the 'survivors': boys, girls, gay, straight. The investigation uncovers a much wider spectrum than they initially believed. 'Spotlight' is mostly a talkie film. I generally don't enjoy talkies, but I found this film captivating, with a very good script. The performances - especially Mark Ruffalo - were also superb.\n\nIt's a controversial subject matter, and no doubt the Church will not take kindly to the film. With priests having to undertake an oath of celibacy, it's not saying much seeing how many priests were involved... just a thought... This was indeed an interesting watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Saw \"Spotlight\" starring Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and Rachel McAdams at Regal Cinemas. The film is based on a true story which portrays what kind of in-depth investigative journalistic reporting it takes to uncover decades of wrong-doings by the Catholic Church, regarding covering-up priests who took advantage and molested several children across Boston, Massachusetts and beyond.\n\nThis year-long investigation by The Boston Globe starting in 2001, explores several victims of sex-crimes which were committed; but no one up to this point in the film ever was convicted of a crime. It is up to the \"Spotlight\" Team of investigative Reporters at The Boston Globe, led by Walter \"Robby\" Robinson, played by Keaton to lead his staff in cracking this case by exposing the abusive Catholic Church Priests to the public and getting justice for those victims.\n\nThe compassion for the victims these reporters had and the passion to gather enough evidence from decades past in order to write a top-notch story to present publicly was extraordinary and well-acted out throughout the film! Sacha Pfeiffer played by McAdams and \"Robby\" played by Keaton confront attorney Eric Macleish played by Billy Crudup who represented the many victims of priests within the Catholic Church, but ultimately they learn he settled these cases outside of court to prevent any paper-trail for a future investigation like this one and obviously public uproar.\n\nMacleish initially refuses to discuss any details of these settlements and really never does, but while confronting him in the lobby where his law firm resides, \"Robby\" appears to threaten Macleish for a victim list. Both he Pfeiffer finally get a list of victims from Macleish later on in the film to add to the other compiled evidence; this after originally claiming he (Macleish) sent a list of victims over to the Globe a few years prior to this investigation and no revealing story ever came from it.\n\nRuffalo who plays Reporter Mike Rezendes shows how much desire he and the entire Spotlight team had to prepare and write a solid story by making several attempts to find credible evidence and sources, while pro-actively taking their time in the field to gather court documents which were sealed-off to the public prior to his efforts in getting those released to the court records room.\n\nSearching for names through old books, making phone calls and hitting the streets interviewing victims were other strategies used by the Spotlight Team while they gathered vital information up to develop their damning story against abusive Catholic Priests. Overall, the film portrayal was interestingly on-point to real-life events as reported, in addition to the acting, and lived-up to its genre, Drama. Definitely a good movie night out! My cinema score is 9/10.\n\nYou can check out The Boston Globe's take on this film HERE: http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/spotlight-movie"

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight has immediately jumped to the forefront of the Best Picture race. Who could have possibly expected otherwise? Late November biopic, relevant topic with just enough controversy, last year's best actor winner Michael Keaton, Spotlight is certainly a perfect storm. On paper. In actuality, we got something messier, less refined. Spotlight lives to expectations, but is fraught with non-stand decisions. Whether these deviations were effective or not is unclear. Be warned, Spotlight strives for uncertainty rather than emotional fulfillment.\n\nLet me clarify via contrast. Argo is comparable in its Oscar-baitness, but opposite in decision making. The best picture 2012 dotted its \"I\"s and crossed its \"T\"s so thoroughly it was practically shameless. Absolutely not groundbreaking, but a solid film nevertheless. Spotlight is deviatory, although not in a pretentious way. There is no central protagonist. The narrative is frayed with loose ends. Most importantly, Spotlight denies basic expectations. This is not criticism, but calling the film well-made or rewarding bonus points for being on the right side of an issue this easy is not productive. My first claim might be the most controversial. It conflicts with the broader Keaton reborn star spin. There are multiple scenes observed from the perspective of alternate character while Walter Robinson (Keaton) simply exists in the background. Often Robinson defers to his assistant and lets her do the talking. There is a historical connection that is not explored. Keaton is effective, but what a bizarre way to use his abilities. Ruffalo as Rezendes, despite top billing, is also not the central focus. I love the acting with his hands, but these are not the mannerism of a protagonist, nor is his arc. This does create more space for the story, but I am unconvinced it is fully used. This is a procedural, but it is certainly not wrought with technical detail. Plot threads are completely abandoned. There is an extremely mesmerizing sequence were a priest offhandedly confesses. Keaton's character literally promises to return to this topic, but fails to. Rufflao has late night meetings that go nowhere. I half expected a greater conspiracy to be afoot from interactions I could only interpret as cryptic hints. Maybe this is a personal failing. Maybe this is a method of supporting the thesis of ambiguity. Maybe this is Spotlights' failing. This effect never creates frustration, but it can be distracting. The ending is also perfectly in line with this motif. The finale barely exists despite the constant building tension. A message: the struggle continues, is unarguably in touch with reality. Just not as satisfying.\n\nOnce again I catch myself being overly critical. High expectations and all. Spotlight demands and receives your investment. I could not imagine anyone possibly responding with indifference. What a gut wrenching tales. If this film has flaws, they are hard to pin down. One of the best if the year.\n\nBut it would be a subpar year if it was THE best."

        "review_detailed_main": "To watch 2015's most talked about movie \"Spotlight\" is to not only get compelled by its excellence but also to encourage conversation of its dark subject matter. As it is inspired by true events, every detail will crawl deeply on your skin. And it would be a fascinating picture to see it from three standpoints: one is obviously from its aesthetics, another from its morals and last on its stance in religion.\n\nAesthetic-wise, director Thomas McCarthy intelligently crafted a fine dialogue-laden picture with tense situations and compelling details. Necessary for a movie about journalists, especially about The Boston Globe's Spotlight team cracking the Boston Catholic church sex scandal. Every character is at the same pedestal, proving how every involvement matters. And the wonderful ensemble, composed of Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schrieber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci, makes up for writer Josh Singer's finely tuned script. At each point when one detail is exposed, a sense of terror is felt in every encounter. Also kudos as well to cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi's camera-work and editor Tom McArdle's pacing that keeps every scene interesting.\n\nWhen it comes to its subject, the movie takes no sides. Everyone is on the same page, as journalism is amoral in form. And for that, \"Spotlight\" takes no safe detours on tackling taboo topics. What prevails is doing the right choice. And from a journalist's point of view, this film challenges the audience's stance in morality and rights.\n\nSpeaking of stance, for a loyally religious (like yours truly), \"Spotlight\" is an eye opener. One may get the gyst that seeing this movie will distort one's perception of the Church, given how comprehensive the real-life Massachusetts archdiocese sex scandal was. For the most affected, this should be a wakeup call to stand firm more in faith and tolerance. And for the rest, it is easy to accept this as a dark reality and a worldwide epidemic. But better understand this as a character study/period piece of people under fire from a painful subject matter; and does not reflect every member. And it would be easy for one to comprehend every horrid reality, as Tom McCarthy perfectly assembled one of this year's finest offerings and one of the best movies about journalism."

        "review_detailed_main": "With 'The Hateful Eight' being my favourite film of 2015, it's pretty obvious that I enjoy dialogue-driven movies which showcase true talent... and thankfully, 'Spotlight' is one of those movies. This film arrived at a perfect time - with the internet slowly killing off print media and people forgetting about the significance of investigative journalism, Tom McCarthy reminds us that real news can have a massive impact in the corrupted world we live in. Watching 'Spotlight' at the cinema restored my faith in the current state of the film industry - alongside all the reboots and mindless action flicks, important works of art are still being created and distributed across the world, and I am truly glad I had the chance to support this film.\n\n'Spotlight' tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, but it also explores the painful trauma of those unfortunate victims and the sheer determination of some amazing journalists to get those voices heard and make things right. It's one of those riveting stories that keep you on the edge of your seat simply through a great script and stellar performances; Mark Ruffalo amazed me in particular with his energetic and captivating performance, and even two lesser-known actors (Michael Cyril Creighton and Jimmy LeBlanc) portraying two of the victims managed to impress me quite a lot in their short yet emotionally powerful roles. In short, the casting for this film was perfect - each actor gave their best and worked off the expertly written script wonderfully.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the film doesn't exactly \"impress\", the camera work isn't anything special - simple shots with simple compositions creating and showing what's necessary, and that's okay. The film doesn't need to be visually impressive, it needs to be coherent and represent the story in an appropriate manner... which is what it achieves. If I had to pick out a negative aspect, it would have to be the soundtrack - it's somewhat typical, simplistic and it enters the film way too often, generally making some of the transitions feel either awkward or forced. But that's it, that's the only flaw I could think of in this otherwise magnificent piece of cinema. 'Spotlight' is not just an impressive achievement, it's an important film that needs to be seen by everyone, which is why I'm giving it a solid 9,2/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Spotlight' is based on a true story about some really terrible things that happened in Boston just over ten years ago. What we see is the process the reporters behind this story took to uncover this awful story. In many movies like this the film can't resist making its main characters heros and the people they are going against the epitome of evil. One movie that comes to mind that did this was 'Concussion'. It set up Doctor Omalu as a hero and the NFL as the most evil corporation on the face of the planet. Fortunately, 'Spotlight' is not one of these films. It's one that understands how far subtly can go. And how far honesty can and should go. This is what makes 'Spotlight' stand apart from virtually every film in this genre. It displays some serious restraint on the part of writer/director Tom McCarthy. He seems to have such intimate knowledge about both this case and how we, as humans, react to things of this nature.\n\nThis allows this story to unfold in the most natural way possible. It lets the audience feel exactly what these people are feeling. Thats what I loved about this film. It lets this riveting story unfold in such a way that lets you basically relieve the story as if it was happening right now. Each new reveal that we get not only throws its characters and audience further on our heads.\n\nWhich is exactly what the film wants. It wants to show how horrible people can be without hardly anyone knowing about it. What's scarier about this film is how some people do know about things like this but sweep it under the rug to avoid unwanted attention. In fact this film is exactly what 'Concussion' should have been. Both are about roughly the same issue except this film views it from a third party perspective.\n\nWhich, again, allows the film to unfold in the very best way possible. Although I felt as though the film was a little too restrained at times. It wanted us to feel the heft of the situation and, for the most part, it does. Except, it holds back certain ideas that keep the film from thoroughly realizing its true potential. We don't learn a whole lot about our characters and that keeps us from really investing in this story. We see them uncovering and reacting to everything but they all react the same way. No one seems to have a unique view on anything.\n\nThis is really the only thing that holds the film back from being the best film of the year. It doesn't quite let you fully get into things due to too much restraint on the characters part. But that doesn't stop the film from being an intensely scary look at corporations and religion. It's a beautifully realized film that is perfectly crafted and executed by both its cast and director."

It's all talk and moves slowly but I was never bored. I'm a native Bostonian and I remember when this story broke. However this movie reveals a LOT more that was never made public. I was VERY angry by the end. It makes it clear that the church knew very well was going on and did nothing to stop it. Even worse they kept transferring the priests from parish to parish spreading the abuse. The movie treats this in a matter of fact way making it all the more powerful. It was beautifully filmed in and around Boston. It's easy to see why this got a Golden Globe nod for Best Direction and an Oscar for Best Picture. All the cast is good--especially McAdams and Ruffalo. When Ruffalo loses control at the end it's shocking. A long and depressing film that will make you angry but it's a must-see movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Spotlight' provides a riveting look at the Boston Globe investigation of the Roman Catholic pedophile priest scandal. As almost everybody knows, the church hierarchy concealed their knowledge of numerous priests who were molesting and raping under-age parishioners. The cover-up of these serious felonies was orchestrated through pay-offs and arm-twisting by Boston's archbishop, the despicable Cardinal Bernard Law. This corrupt cleric seemed to rule over the city, and his criminal negligence allowed the depraved activity to continue for many years.\n\nThe victims were countless Bostonians who endured this abuse and had their lives ruined. The heroes were an embattled lawyer, a resolute editor and a small group of persistent journalists who dismantled the obfuscation and red tape of respected authority figures and entrenched institutions. The villains were Law, his venal church and the priests who pretended piety while they preyed upon the young. 'Spotlight' tells this twisted tale with excellent writing, direction and acting.\n\nIt's worth noting Law fled to Rome after the scandal broke, was given an honorary position and still lives in comfort in a Vatican palace. In 2012 he was the prime lobbyist against giving women more responsibility in the church. Nothing much appears to have changed in the RC Boys' Club."

Cardinal Law would had the victims paid off and then moved them around so they would live to abuse another day.\n\nThe Spotlight team of the Globe are requested by their new editor to investigate and their diligence pays off. They uncover a horde of abusive priests who damaged generations of children.\n\nDirector Tom McCarthy aimed to make a modern version of All the President's Men. They even have a Ben Bradley but it is junior the son of the great editor of The Washington Post.\n\nMcCarthy treats the film as a procedural. It starts off as a weak story, most of the journalists are not interested in investigating the Catholic church that still has a big foothold in Boston.\n\nHowever as the team probes they uncover more layers, more victims, more deviant priests and the newspapers own failings. Several people tell the journalists that information and documents was sent to them in the past and they did nothing.\n\nThe film benefits from the acting of its ensemble cast ranging from Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo to Billy Crudup. Liev Schreiber is very restrained here, unusually for a newspaper editor bought in to shake things up.\n\nRuffalo has the more showy role. Spotlight is not a flashy film though. Despite a stellar cast, it comes across as a low budget film."

The events of \"Spotlight\" at the editorial staff of The Boston Globe happened 2001, when the internet was new to the big crowd and journalists had time for deep research work because of a lot of print readers (and enough money available for good work. Because when things run massively wrong in society, like in this terrible case at the Catholic Church, it needs dedicated people, who look deeply behind the smokescreen. The movie shows, how difficult it is, to mess with established institutions like the church, because people don't want to know, that with this savior they believe in, something totally going wrong. The members of the Spotlight team are true heroes, working in the background. The movie put a spotlight on their outstanding work."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight is a film that tackles a profoundly important subject with a level of precision and care that's admirable. Directed by Tom McCarthy, It's a gripping piece of journalism brought to life with a strong cast and a methodical approach to storytelling. One of the film's most significant strengths lies in its portrayal of the investigative process. The meticulous way in which Spotlight delves into the research and reporting aspects of the story provides a compelling and authentic look at how journalists tackle such a monumental task. The film's pacing reflects the slow and painstaking nature of investigative journalism, allowing viewers to appreciate the depth and complexity of the work involved.\n\nThe cast delivers performances that are both restrained and powerful. Ruffalo, in particular, stands out with a performance that conveys both the frustration and determination of his character, adding emotional weight to the film. Another notable aspect of Spotlight is its ability to handle sensitive material with respect and gravity. The film doesn't sensationalize the abuse but rather focuses on the systemic issues and institutional failures that allowed such heinous acts to persist for so long.\n\nHowever, despite its many strengths, Spotlight is not without its downsides. The film's deliberate pace, while true to the investigative process, can sometimes feel slow and methodical, potentially losing some viewers who are looking for more dramatic tension or faster-moving plots. The emphasis on procedure and dialogue means that the film lacks a certain emotional immediacy, which can make it feel somewhat detached from the personal experiences of the victims. Moreover, while the film is meticulously crafted, it occasionally leans towards a clinical presentation of the events. The lack of deeper exploration into the personal lives and struggles of the journalists might leave some viewers wanting more character development. The film's focus on the broader implications of the investigation sometimes overshadows the individual stories and emotional journeys of the people involved.\n\nIn conclusion, Spotlight is a powerful and well-crafted film that excels in presenting a crucial and harrowing story with respect and detail. Its strong performances and commitment to authenticity make it a compelling watch, though its deliberate pace and clinical approach might not resonate with everyone."

        "review_detailed_main": "I rarely watch movies, but someone recommended this one to me as a \"balanced\" portrayal of the priest abuse crisis. I wasn't impressed, especially after having read traditional Catholic Randy Engel's excellent investigative journalism into the priest-pederast crisis, her 5 vol. \u00abRite of Sodomy: Homosexuality and the Roman Catholic Church\u00bb.\n\nThe film mentioned how homosexuality has nothing to do with this crisis, which is not at all true (80-90% of the cases are ephebophilia, sodomitic attraction to teenage males, not pedophilia). It portrayed the free press as the real savior of mankind (thus promoting more French Revolution, Liberal errors; cf. Pope Gregory XVI's encyclical \u00abMirari Vos\u00bb). The journalists were portrayed as \"secular confessors.\" I did learn one thing: The Boston Globe got its first Jewish editor, Marty Barton, right before the Spotlight team started running hundreds of stories against the Church. Conflict of interest? Balanced journalism? Where are the stories on pederast rabbis? Pedophile school teachers? etc.? In this sense, the film correctly portrayed Barton as being against \"the system\" (i.e., against the Catholic Church).\n\nAlso, Boston Globe won the Pulitzer Prize in 2003 because of its Spotlight team's work. The Spotlight film won an Academy Award for best film of 2015! Pattern here? Yes: Jew-dominated, self-laudatory awards being used to undermine the Church's authority.\n\nThe film's character development and artistic quality was sorely lacking."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tom McCarthy's new film Spotlight is sure to be one of the most talked about and perhaps even one of the most controversial films of this year. The true story of a group of newspaper writers and their editors who decided to expose the vast number of cases involving sexual abuse within the Catholic church. This is a film that is extremely powerful to watch and while you are watching the film it affects you deeply because of the sensitive subject matter that it is dealing with and also because what these writers are uncovering is extremely disturbing and sure to leave you feeling uneasy and even perhaps a bit nauseated while watching the film. The fact that all of this is based upon true events that did not just occur over a short period of time, but spanning decades and perhaps even longer than that and the fact is that unfortunately the types of abuse documented and reported upon in the film are still happening to this day. The film takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and while a lot of priests and members of the Catholic church were uncovered there, it unfortunately doesn't just stop there, but spans all across the United States as well as pretty much all corners of the world. To my knowledge with the release of this film, I have not heard, or read about any backlash, or negative comments from the Catholic church regarding the matter, but on the other hand, if the film is factual which it certainly says it is, perhaps the church does want to remain silent on this issue especially because as I stated above it covers over the decades and is still a continuing problem. When, I make these remarks I must add that I am not an atheist, or have a personal vendetta against the Catholic church, or Catholics in general. While, I do not go to a Catholic church, I do and have watched a Catholic television series for years now and have really enjoyed the sound teaching of the program and in many ways it has been a blessing to me. Also, I do not think that the intent of the filmmakers here was to stir up trouble, or slam religion, or religious institutions in general. I think the main purpose of this film was to show everything that was being covered up for all these years and is still covered up to this day and the fact that these people claim to be worshipping God and obeying His word, but in fact living deceitful lives that go against the true teachings of the Bible and everything that their faith stands for. The film is not condemning religion at all, but instead the people who use religion as a means to pervert their own lies and injustices and claim that it is all okay because they hide under the cloak of the church and so for them it must be okay when really it is not. This is a fascinating film to watch and just like any good news story, or world event that is unfolding before your eyes the film is in equal parts fascinating, entertaining and yet as I mention above that because it is dealing with sensitive issues and based on fact that it is also extremely affecting and will certainly leave an impression on you after you leave the theatre and perhaps for longer than that. Everything is done right with this film from it's excellent screenplay which incorporates real facts, events and people and glues us to the screen in a film that is more captivating and in a sense more thrilling than any other action films of this year, or perhaps many others. The entire cast here is all top notch as determined people who are bound and determined to get to the truth of this story. They are not just doing this as to make names for themselves, or to bring themselves a lot of money, but instead because the subject matter is also personal for them and the people that they interview and meet, so in a sense they are out to right an incredible wrong and will stop at nothing to uncover this. The characters each respond to the matter in their own ways which also leaves a very interesting and percept view of the whole subject and runs the gamut of how each individual would, or maybe would not feel in this type of case, or situation. The character development and the portrayals by the actors is excellent. This is one of the strongest casts I have seen in awhile. This is a film for people who stand for truth and love deeply moving and affecting films and this is certainly a film that will leave it's mark on the audience and perhaps society as well which is all because of the power and talent that went into making it. One of the year's best."

He had seen it before and didn't mind going again while I was just experiencing this for the first time. No graphic scenes but many of the victims didn't mince words when describing what happened to them at such young ages so I either covered my mouth or hit the chair, not too hard, when those were revealed. Visually, this probably wasn't as impressive as another Best Picture nominee-The Revenant, for instance-but it was riveting enough dramatically, otherwise, for me and perhaps for my friend, as well.

It tells its story well, and its cast is fun to watch throughout. It was great to see Michael Keaton in a serious role a year after \"Birdman\", and Keaton definitely adds to the film's gravitas. Mark Ruffalo turns out a similarly strong performance. I had to do a double take, as I first thought someone had miraculously turned Tony Danza thirty years younger just for this movie--Ruffalo's haircut and accent were Danza to a T. But \"The Hulk\" turns out a strong performance, and provides an effective performance in the film's climax. Similarly, Rachel McAdams is my new celebrity crush--she shines in this movie.\n\nThe down side to this film is the subject matter. Yes, it's an important story to be told, and inasmuch as that's true, this is a very important film that everyone should see at least once. But as with other historical dramas of difficult subject matter, \"Schindler's List\" and the like, this movie leaves you emotionally drained. Because of that, the movie is not one that many will want to watch more than once.\n\nThat said, I will note that the film ends in a very satisfying way, providing a very effective closing scene that does add a certain amount of resolution to the movie.\n\nAll in all I'm going with 8/10 stars. It's extremely well made--just \"heavy\" in a way that makes it hard to enjoy."

        "review_title": "A familiar story, but well-told",
        "review_detailed_main": "If you've seen one movie about journalists, you've seen them all. They're like intellectual versions of the \"Rocky\" movies, with reporters as plucky underdogs who beat the odds. With \"Spotlight\", the story of how the Boston Globe uncovered 30 years of child sexual abuse in the Boston Archdiocese, the elements are all there: the intrepid reporters facing impossible odds, the shadowy good ol' boy networks blocking the investigation, the world-weary editor putting everything on the line, and justice being done in the end.\n\nWhile the film doesn't break any new ground, however, it does do a very good job of telling the story of one of the last feats of real investigative journalism in America. There are no surprises here, even if you don't know anything about the sexual abuse crisis in the Church. But for all its predictability, \"Spotlight\" has moments of real brilliance, and knows the world it inhabits inside and out.\n\nIn 2001, Boston Globe reporters Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) and Sasha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) start investigating John Geoghan, a priest who molested hundreds of boys. They uncover evidence that the Catholic Church has been covering up decades of priest sex abuse and shuffling the offenders from parish to parish, allowing them to molest with impunity. Of course, the Church throws its full weight behind killing the story, but senior editors Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton) and Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) take on the corruption with help from Mitch Garebedian (Stanley Tucci), a lawyer representing the priests' victims.\n\nI worked as a reporter for several years, and every detail of the investigative process portrayed in this movie rang true for me, often painfully so. It captures the thrill of chasing an important story and the frustration of hitting a dead end. It knows that a reporter's job is a thankless one, but that the small moments of triumph - a detail that puts everything together, your name on a front page story, an approving nod from your editor - make it all worthwhile. It's rare, and refreshing, to see a movie about people who love their jobs.\n\nThe top-billed stars, Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo, are okay, not great; they're at best blandly competent, occasionally slipping into ham territory with wide-eyed monologues of righteous indignation. This is a supporting actor's movie. As a lawyer for the Archdiocese who tries to block the story, Jamey Sheridan is compelling as the kind of reluctant accomplice who allows these sorts of crimes to go unpunished in the name of \"just doing his job\"; he seems aged before his time by years of unacknowledged guilt. Keaton and Schrieber are nicely understated as men who have given their lives to a profession that is changing faster than they can adapt, old school guys who hate having to care about the online edition. Tucci is fantastic as a true advocate, a man who has spent years fighting for what's right and has the scars to prove it.\n\n\"Spotlight\" is at heart an old-fashioned story about good triumphing over evil through dogged work and unbending belief. It's a story all the more satisfying for the fact that it is true. It's a little by-the-numbers, but that's okay; it's nice to know that there is a formula for good people doing the right thing."

        "review_detailed_main": "This excellent film dramatises the Boston Globe newspaper's exposure in 2001 of the years old child abuse practices of hundreds of Roman Catholic priests in and around the city and the attendant cover-up by the powers that be in the church from the Cardinal on down. More than that, it points the finger at the shoulder-shrugging complicity of other areas of the establishment like the law courts, police and the press, including the paper's own earlier self, burying previous isolated reports on the subject deep in the paper without thought of following up the bigger story. Indeed it takes the arrival of a new editor at the paper to revive the story which he does by setting loose its specialist four-strong investigative team known as Spotlight on the case, where they soon find substance to the rumours and fight to bring it to light.\n\nThe subject matter is of course bound to invite viewer sympathy but the film doesn't simply prey on that. Reminiscent at times of the likes of \"All The President's Men\" and classic TV series like \"Lou Grant\", it works by taking us inside the workings of the paper and avoiding gratuitous dramatic showdowns with either individual priests or even the misguided Cardinal, the climax to the sordid affair is simply the story finally hitting the streets on the paper's front page. There's no big self- congratulatory triumphant scene at the end, merely a shockingly long list of other instances the world over of the church covering over the traces of paedophile priests abusing their positions of trust.\n\nThe acting is high quality, with the revitalised Michael Keaton as the sage leader of the team, keen to bring down not just the Cardinal but the whole cover-up system which protected the offending priests by signing them out of commission with anodyne phrases like \"on sick leave\" for example. He's driven by his own incidental complicity in not digging deeper into the story when it first aired years before but it's he who eventually drives out the vital corroboration which enables it to finally get out there. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams are also very good as the Rossi and Billie of the team, teasing the story out of the worn-out and cowed solicitor who first tried to put forward the victims' stories, again well played by Stanley Tucci and generally putting in the hard yards behind the story to get it into print.\n\nThere's probably another story in there about the Vatican's complicity in the hushing up process, but the film is probably right to localise the action and let the viewer contemplate this and other pertinent questions (like where are the offending priests now, for one) arising from this worthy and well made picture."

Good journalism is essential in a democracy, and that is one of the great lessons this movie shows her audience.\n\nI think Spotlight has a great chance to win the Best Picture award at the Oscars. However, the Revenant has a higher chance of winning, as it is a more original movie which was certainly not easy to make. I think the Academy will definitely reward that, but that doesn't mean Spotlight isn't one of the best movies of the 2015/2016 Oscar season.\n\nGo see it guys!"

I don't think i love America all too much, but these are the things that America can - and should - be respected all around the globe. Still, something is rotten in the state of Denmark, and to make things right it's not enough to simply be a power - you have to actually use it sometimes to enforce that the good remains good and the evil is eradicated.\n\nSpotlight is a story of one case of such struggle.

Because the way the film shows it, the Catholic Church is an alias for God himself for a great many people in America, and the problem of child molestation by Catholic priests is more than just a rare case of \"a few bad apples\", it's a widespread phenomenon, a tendency, a real system.\n\nOf course, a journalism drama movie is mostly defined by the topic it covers, so it could be tempting to put the equals sign between the quality of a movie and the importance of the topic. However, it would be an understatement. A good movie is more than just a summary of the story, it's a drama (or even a tragedy) of simple people involved in it. And through their eyes we get to see what could be a dry text in an encyclopedia book as something living, vivid and emotionally disturbing. Something that we take personal.\n\nAnd that's where Spotlight really shines. What we are shown is not just the facts - which, i'm sure, most of us have known (at least to some extent) for a long time - but the way those facts hit the real people living in the same world the story belongs to. Facts that hit people like a hammer hits things: some of them break, some get bent and crooked and some remain straight and pierce the reality around them to make a difference. The team of investigative journalists from the Spotlight section of The Boston Globe is a pack of those straight things: no matter what pressure is put on them by the story they uncover, no matter how personal it ends up to be, their top priority is to serve the public good.\n\nWhat makes the story of Spotlight stand out is that the public is not completely aware of what is good for it. The Catholic Church is not an enemy people wanna fight, it's something that gives you faith, a ground to stand upon when the world around is shaking, but then starts corrupting all the good things it's done, leaving people confused, emptied and destroyed.\n\nIt's one thing to just tell about those horrible devastating things. It's a completely different one to make you feel something about it. And to give you more than a one-dimensional sense of shame or anger or disappointment, but instead to fill you with a stinging cocktail of them all, is a task only a master can accomplish. And i believe that the team that made Spotlight had such masters in it.\n\nI believe that it was the characters and their portrayal by actors that made a difference. They are just a team of journalists and a couple lawyers doing their job. But at the same time it's not just a job for them. It's a personal stance. And each of them has different feelings because of it. Mark Ruffalo's character is energetic and angry, a true Hulk of a reporter (maybe even more believable as one than in Avengers or anywhere else), Rachel McAdams' characters brings soothing compassion only her face and voice are capable to convey. Stanley Tucci gives us an outsider with limited power who still tries to do the right thing. And Michael Keaton and Liev Schreiber show us the people who finally try to cha(lle)nge something that was neglected for way too long and go all-in while doing it. One by one, these characters don't seem like much special, but united by one thirst for justice, they become a force capable of making a major change.\n\nI can't say that Spotlight breaks the confines of its genre. Even with Michael Keaton in it, it's no Birdman, and it can't simply fly away from all the rules set for it. Still, it's a movie that tries its best not to be a clich\u00e9 fest, and for a story that's bound by the facts it's based on, it has a surprising amount of freedom in it. So if you even remotely enjoy movies where people talk about complex things more than they yell or throw punches, give this one a try."

This film goes into so much detail about the emotional distress, the determination from the team, the struggle with the legal system in getting the truth out, etc. The ensemble cast is well picked out, with everybody doing a great job. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Mcadams both give Oscar worthy performances, and Michael Keaton was surprisingly amazing, showing that Birdman was not a one time hit for him.\n\nFor a touchy subject matter like this, It's really risky to put it out there, as some people (including the Academy) don't like films with uncomfortable topics. This film handled it so perfectly and so maturely that it deserves every bit of credibility. It's very historically accurate, resisting the temptation to make the main characters out to be superheroes that save the day, but instead just portrays them as people simply doing their jobs, which is what this movie does. It doesn't go out of its way to blow itself up bigger than it is, or try to establish any bit of greater importance, it simply does its job, and does it great. It is completely airtight, there is no fat on this film whatsoever. Every scene is escalating the plot further in some way, and is packed full of the meat of the story, which I savored every little bit of.\n\nTightly written, tightly edited, tightly acted, and tightly directed, this is a unique and impressive quality film that will inspire you until the end."

It was difficult not getting any info on this, It hasn't premiered here in Denmark yet, but is already collecting a ton of reviews from the US, but I managed to see it at a special sneak peek before release, arranged by kino.dk and it was very good.\n\nIt is a very interesting way of showing these events or the notion and exploration of them, seeing it all from the journalists, how the start digging at something that seems small and then it just escalates, in Denmark there wasn't that big a fuzz about this, we are not that many catholics, so seeing the attention and wide range it had for the city of Boston and how it spread after the story broke is quite overwhelming. That this could even happen and be covered up again and again is appalling, but the film shows the story from a very good side, I expect that had it been some years ago, it would have focused more on the \"bad\" priests, what they did and why they did and how they covered it up, but seeing it all from the investigative side, from the journalists at The Boston Globe Spotlight division is really interesting. How they keep digging and digging, uncovering more cases, finding more survivors, talking to people and lawyers and trying to make it all make sense.\n\nThe acting is really good, they are all experienced at their jobs, some a bit out off their usual element, but they do a very fine job. Especially Mark Ruffalo as the workaholic, very persistence reporter, but also Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams & Liev Schreiber have some great roles as the Spotlight reporters, I could extend the list to all the other cast members, they all do a fantastic job. You can see the tenacity, persistence, frustrations and excitement on all of them, they don't know how deep the rabbit hole will be, they don't know who they will drag into this, they just know they are on to something and they have to be meticulous, secretive, stubborn and just keep at it.\n\nIt was a treat seeing this at a special screening before the release here in Denmark, in has been out in the states for some time, but will not have theatrical release here before end February.\n\nLocation, seating & time: Dagmar, Nordisk Film, Vesterbro, Denmark - Bio 4, row 4 seat 1, 2, 4 & 6 - 26.01.2016 at 16.30"

The \"Spotlight\"-team was awarded for the Pulitzer Prize of 2003.\n\nBut even if you know the story behind that all, you will be surprised and still shocked, by each revelation during this movie, and you will gain much empathy for the investigating journalists.\n\nThat is thanks to the actors especially. It's no wonder the cast won the Critics' Choice Award for \"Best Ensemble\" because Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton and Brian d'Arcy James totally nailed their characters. Also Liev Schreiber does a great job, as the new editor of the Bosten Globe, who gets the ball of investigation rolling.\n\nAnd to deliver such an acting and such a passion is not easy in a film which is set mostly in the basement: the basement of a newspaper office and in the deepest basement of humanity.\n\nPeace."

        "review_detailed_main": "For many years, the running joke about the movies that have won the Best Picture Oscar is that they only won because another film should have won years prior. Spotlight (2015) is this generation's All the President's Men (1976) in that it is an excellent film about investigative journalism that broke open a huge cover-up, changing the world forever. Both films deserved to be Best Picture, but Spotlight manages to take an uncomfortable subject and be frank and open about the problems that we still see in today's society.\n\nSince most of the movie is comprised of uncovering the truth behind the sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church, it's surprising how gripping and well-paced the film ends up being. Part of the genius of this film is the high-energy dedication these four journalists have in uncovering the terrifying truths that had been lurking in the shadows for decades. While such a subject could easily create a bias, this film manages to take an almost unbiased approach in its search for the depth of the problem that most people would ignore to keep the status quo. The tension created with each subsequent twist and turn of the investigation keeps the audience wondering how much further the corruption can go.\n\nThe impact of Spotlight deserves to be recognized, which is why I am glad that it won Best Picture for 2015. While intrinsically simple, this film delivers a powerful, emotional punch without relying on hackneyed methods to pull at the heartstrings of its viewers. Upon a second viewing a few years later, I was able to notice more of the menacing subtlety of the churches and cathedrals placed conveniently near playgrounds, schools, and other child-friendly zones. That is the brilliance of this movie: knowing the threat, but also knowing how many people are unaware of it.\n\nAn excellent film that asks the hard questions of the status quo, I give Spotlight 5.0 stars out of 5."

        "review_detailed_main": "A cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the intricacies of human emotion and relationships, is a must-watch for those who appreciate thought-provoking narratives. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, the film's portrayal of real-life struggles and its exceptional cast make it a captivating and unforgettable experience.\n\nAt first glance, the plot may seem familiar to avid fans of drama, as it touches upon themes that have been explored in various stories before. However, what sets this apart is its remarkable execution and attention to detail. The movie draws the audience in with its authentic portrayal of everyday life, managing to capture even the smallest nuances of human interactions. From heartfelt conversations to moments of intense conflict, the film succeeds in creating a sense of relatability that keeps viewers emotionally invested from start to finish.\n\nCentral to the film's success is the incredible cast, whose performances are nothing short of extraordinary. Each actor brings their character to life in a way that feels genuine and compelling. Their ability to convey complex emotions through subtle facial expressions and body language adds an additional layer of depth to the storytelling. It's evident that the cast members fully immersed themselves in their roles, resulting in performances that are both mesmerizing and emotionally resonant.\n\nOne of the film's most commendable aspects is its willingness to tackle challenging and uncomfortable subjects head-on. It doesn't shy away from portraying the raw and unfiltered aspects of life, presenting its characters with a myriad of obstacles and dilemmas. This unapologetic approach adds a sense of authenticity to the narrative, allowing the audience to connect with the characters on a deeper level. While some may find the film's realism a bit overwhelming, it ultimately contributes to the overall impact and message of the story.\n\nThe pacing of this is deliberate and reflective, allowing the audience to fully absorb the emotional weight of each scene. The director's keen sense of timing ensures that pivotal moments have the necessary impact, while quieter moments provide a necessary breather. This balance prevents the film from becoming overly melodramatic and instead keeps the focus on the characters' personal growth and relationships.\n\nIt's important to note that thisisn't without its flaws. The reliance on familiar tropes and plot devices occasionally leads to predictability, and some viewers might find themselves anticipating certain developments. However, the exceptional performances and the film's ability to evoke genuine emotional responses largely outweigh these minor shortcomings.\n\nWhile this caters to a specific audience that appreciates realistic and emotionally charged narratives, it's essential to acknowledge that it may not be suitable for those seeking light-hearted entertainment or escapism. The film's commitment to exploring the complexities of human nature and relationships requires a certain level of emotional investment from the viewer. As such, those who prefer more lighthearted or fantastical storytelling might not find the film as engaging.\n\nIn conclusion,this is a compelling exploration of the human experience, driven by an exceptional cast and a dedication to authenticity. Its willingness to embrace real-life challenges and present them in a genuine light sets it apart from other dramas in the genre. While it may not appeal to those who shy away from intense emotional narratives, it's a must-watch for anyone who values powerful performances and thought-provoking storytelling. This will leave you with a profound appreciation for the complexities of life and a lingering sense of empathy for its characters' journeys."

It isn't the only film I like with Ruffalo in it, but Michael Keaton, and Rachel McAdmas are pluses. The theme is sexual exploration of padres in church duly unearthed by a group of journos. This is a subtle film that implicates the media, the Catholic church, the law, the lawyers and other institutions - which it describes in a comprehensive cultural cover-up. Spotlight deserves to be mentioned side by side with \u00a8Citizen Kane\u00a8, \"All the President's Men,\" and while it never enshrines its newsgatherers, it stands as a reminder of the Fifth Power and the meaning of free press, particularly in combatting corruption and malice. It's the best film McCarthy has made: restrained, intelligent, unfolding with the rhythm of a dense thriller.

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into this film with an open mind. just having come fresh off \"The Revenant\", I was expecting a good drama. with people you care about and people you could connect with. but when viewing this movie, I got a two hour long snore fest that makes \"The Host\" from 2013 look like an Oscar contender. \"Spotlight\" is one of the most over hyped movies of the 2015 award season.\n\n\"Spotlight\" follows the Boston Globe's Spotlight team's investigation of child abuse in the Boston area by the local priests. It stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup.\n\nEveryone describes this movie as \"The best drama of 2015\" to which I say What movie did you people watch? The movie is incredibly BORING. There's no drama, you don't connect with any of the characters portrayed in the film, and there's no intensity. Now, when I watch a movie, I expect good acting, a good story, good characters, good direction, and most importantly, a good bond between me and the people on screen.\n\nAs far as acting goes, both Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams give some fantastic performances. Easily worthy of Oscar nominations. Michael Keaton on the other hand, is once again a horrible actor. This movie did not make me like him any more than what I previously did. Granted I didn't review last year's Birdman, but I watched it and thought it was a garbage movie that made no sense. I hated him in \"Birdman\" and I hated him now in \"Spotlight.\" Don't quit your day job Mr. Keaton, that's all I can really say about you. As for the other actors, the film was so boring to me I don't remember how the other actors preformed.\n\nAt two hours and eight minutes, \"spotlight\" dragged on as if it was 2 months and 8 days. it just wouldn't end. Now, \"The Revenant\" is Two hours and Thirty-Six minutes Long. I had just come off of watching that movie, and it felt like One hour and 10 Minutes.\n\nOverall \"Spotlight\" is an over hyped, waste of time that should not be watched. This movie should be a 0.1% because of how boring it is. 8.9% is FAR to Generous. DO NOT watch this movie. save your money and go watch \"Room\". \"Room\" has a much better Narrative, better characters that you root for, a much better plot, and better acting.\n\nUnfortunately, IMDb doesn't allow you to give movies 0 stars or 0 out of 10s, so I have to live with giving \"Spotlight\" a 1 out of 10. An awful disgrace of a movie which should never be viewed by everyone. If you're an Academy Member and you're reading this, DO NOT vote for this movie. there are FAR better award movies out such as \"The Martian\", \"Mad Max Fury Road\", \"Room\", \"The Revenant\", and even \"Carol\".\n\nFinal Rating: 1/10. (0 out of 10 if I were allowed to.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have watched this film 3 times and each time I am in awe at how finely tuned the screenplay is in terms of both the issues and the storytelling. The script, for example, both demonstrates the power of the media while bluntly criticizing the Globe for not putting the pieces together sooner. It makes the characters not saints but people who did their job well and did a service for the community. Likewise, by including a spectrum of reactions among Catholics (lapsed I some cases) the film manages to criticizes the Catholic hierarchy without criticizing the Catholic faith. The accounts of the victims contain enough detail to bring into focus the awfulness of sexual assault without being obscene or sensationalist.\n\nBut best of all, each scene feels included for the sake of the story. So, for example, when Mike blows up and gives voice to feeling betrayed it is both to give voice to that sort of reaction and a natural outgrowth of Mike's character. It explains why he had been such a workaholic on this story. Nothing feels included to shape the societal points and yet the more you look at the information presented a hell of lot of societal points are made. The script is one of the best ever written.\n\nFortunately, the masterful script is brought to life by a great cast and simply but effective direction. This is truly a great film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight is such an important and powerful film. This is the story of a team of Boston Globe journalists who discovered how the church was hiding many pedophile priests giving them no real punishments. This film won Best Picture about three years ago and it totally deserved it. What makes this movie so great is that it decided to showcase the complete journalism process, the way we start to see our four reporters start to uncover the truth is amazing. It's not about the drama or the personal struggles of a particular character, it's about how a journalist does his or her job, and why it's important. Apart from that, it doesn't shy away from the subject matter of pedophiles. On one particular scene Sacha, the character amazingly played by Rachel McAdams, says: \"Language is going to be really important here. The word 'molest' isn't going to be enough\". And that's totally it, we get the hard and difficult truth of the actual events that happened with no sugarcoating. The overall look and tone of the film was beautiful, there are a couple shots that took my breath away. And this top level of filmmaking complements the top level acting from the whole ensemble. This movie is so real it actually terrifies me about the situation they uncovered. It's the truth, which can be really hard and disturbing, but it's the whole truth."

        "review_detailed_main": "The front-runner for Best Original Screenplay in just about every award show this year is Spotlight. the riveting, frighteningly accurate story about the cover-up and exposure of the pedophilia scandal that nearly destroyed the Catholic Church during the 2000's. As the statistic was at that time, nearly 6% off all catholic priests in the world were accused of sexual assault. Yes, it's far too painful to want to believe, but this is true. A noticeable amount Catholic priests were guilty of this, and many more may exist to this day. The truth is, these things happened, and the Church did next to nothing to stop it. It caused many people, like myself, to become lapsed Catholics, and some became not religious at all. Thus, Spotlight, a film about journalism, is a microcosm of journalism in itself. It's the truth that you don't want to hear, but you really should hear. Tom McCarthy brings the story to life with an unbeatable cast. The standout star is Mark Ruffalo, who in this, gives a raging monologue that has easily sealed him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The best scenes are, without a doubt, the interviews with the survivors. You'll be left stunned, that's all I have to say right now. There's not a moment of drag in this picture. Spotlight hooks you in to the very last frame. It's screenplay is the heart of it all. It reaffirms you how intelligent a film can truly be. If this doesn't win any awards for Best Original Screenplay in the coming season, I'd be flabbergasted. Spotlight absolutely delivers as an engaging drama, a loud advocate of free speech and a relentless call for criminal justice everywhere."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a Roman Catholic, I can safely say that these abusive men are pieces of garbage, and have no place anywhere but Hell. It is also tough to see this type of scandal and take hatred from others that like to group you with these monsters and not be shaken spiritually. That being said, in order for me to get anything out of this movie, I realized that I needed to put myself, and my beliefs, out of the picture.\n\nSo, as far as unbiased feelings about the film, I thought it was an interesting and different perspective on crime films. Taken from a newspaper's point of view, this has the potential to inspire other artists to create a similar premise in the future. The acting is also very strong, and the screenplay is another solid aspect of this movie.\n\nWith this in mind, I felt the camerawork, although not bad, was boring and lifeless at times. The film also dragged at points making it feel longer than it actually is.\n\nOverall, it has a strong message that can be applied to anybody. That message being to realize that there are bad apples in all organization, and that those we may trust have secrets that could be dangerous to others. Not a mind-blowing film for me, but strong overall. Highly recommend viewing to gain a message from the movie yourself."

I've been watching movies all my life, and I can't think of many examples of this happening.\n\nBefore that point, the film seemed filled with \"newsroom drama clich\u00e9s\" (IE: smirking villains, overly likable protagonists, montage after montage, etc). It just felt \"ok...but I've seen this before.\" Also, I was afraid it would become another \"Black Mass\"; a well executed, factually correct, but ultimately, for me, a hollow experience.\n\nBut, there's a moment when this film decides to go its own way, and it does so very well: - The obstacles become increasingly more interesting. - The emotional scenes in this film are handled well. They seem appropriate and never forced. - The film is brave in its portrayal of the Roman Catholic Church, and pulls no punches. With films like these, you'd expect filmmakers to walk on eggshells and try not to offend their viewers. It was a nice surprise to not see this happen in \"Spotlight\".\n\n7.8/10 or B+ Watch for Mark Ruffalo, who steals the show yet again."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us.\"\n\nAfter watching \"Concussion\", I wondered how former NFL players would react to this film. After seeing \"Spotlight\", I asked myself whether the clergy had the courage to see this film or not. And also if lessons were drawn from this. Would the Church restore his original role in society? A haven for believers. Its function as middleman between the divine and the Christians. An institution created as a service for the needy, poor and pious. Or would abuses such as addressed in \"Spotlight\" simply continue to exist? Because lets admit it. The credits at the end of the film are more horrible than the actual film. It shows that the cited case is only a tip of the iceberg.\n\nWhat's more frightening? Being pursued by a deranged maniac who's wearing a hockey mask and carries a chainsaw? Or being abused by a perverted priest who can't restrain his lust because of a self-imposed celibacy? Perhaps the first is extremely deadly. But the second one causes such a trauma, the victim wishes to encounter such a nut with a chainsaw to release him from his suffering. The things I thoroughly hate are abuse of power, inviolability, breach of trust and covering up criminal offenses by powerful authorities. And that's something common within the church. A little bit too much fooling around with little choirboys? No problem. We'll put you in another parish where you can play shepherd again and watch over some tame sheep. Disgusting.\n\n\"Spotlight\" reminded me of \"All the President's Men\" with a young Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford playing Carl Bernstein's and Bob Woodward, two Washington Post journalists who published articles about the Watergate scandal. Also a cover-up. But this one happened on a political level. The only result there was the resignation of president Nixon. The ecclesiastical cover-up made lots of victims. \"Spotlight\" is a dead serious film with a dead serious, nauseating topic. It's admirable that they didn't let it degenerate into an accusatory film that would unleash a veritable witch-hunt. Needless to say, the main roles are played impressively by Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Liev Schreiber. And for once, I was hoping that Ruffalo would briefly change into that green, muscular monster so he would crush a few clerics to the size of a of a host.\n\nMore reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is easily one of the best live action films of 2015. At the end of the year this movie will likely get a lot of Oscar attention, and it truly deserves it. Spotlight holds nothing back, features an ensemble of amazing performances, and tells a haunting true story. This story is recent enough that many people probably still remember, but old enough that many people will probably find it educational.\n\nPerhaps the film's greatest strength is it's story, which is incredibly dense with information. Not to spoil the film, but to give context the film is about a large scandal involving the Boston Catholic Priests in 2001. The story is so dense that it would have been easy to hold back information or gloss over plot elements, but somehow the filmmakers behind this film were able to fit it all into the film, in just over 2 hours. The film is unapologetically real, despite the occasional moments of theatricality, which all films have.\n\nThe entire cast is magnificent in this film, lead by Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton. Both of which will probably receive Oscar nominations for back-to-back years. In a film that relies on a slow-burn approach, with a more emotional grip on the audience, the acting was paramount, and the entire cast delivered. It's most impressive, because they are able to every moment and make it feel important through their portrayals. These performances also help to make the characters feel more real, and relatable.\n\nThe performances support one other major strength of the film, which is the haunting tone of the film. The film is scary in an very real way, as the film showcases that even in large hubs with millions of people, massive secrets can be hidden. At a time with drones, and widespread public mistrust it makes the film even scarier. It's the haunting story and tone that helps elevate the acting, to form a truly great film.\n\nIn the end the film tells a relevant story that every American should know, without compromising its source material. Spotlight is a film so good that even the churches it condemned had to admit that it was great. The film will likely receive a lot of award recognition, and rightfully so, as it stands as one of the best movies of 2015. It's a haunting film that tells a story so compelling and unbelievable it becomes a must see film."

        "review_title": "A very BIG Oscar Contender - Fantastic Acting and Amazing Directing",
        "review_detailed_main": "'Spotlight' is a Drama/Biopic that tells the true story of the Boston Globe reporting team known as 'Spotlight' and their investigations into the allegations of child abuse in the Catholic Church and how what they uncovered in Boston had a huge affect on the rest of the world. This isn't a topic that people really like to discuss openly and is something that happened fairly recently and is still having an impact on society today. And this film did an amazing job at presenting this story in a way that makes it easy to understand for the audience and keeps it very grounded and real without making it a very uncomfortable thing to watch. It is impossible to tell the story without having to go into some of the horrifying and somewhat confronting details, so the film did great at finding a balance between being too controversial and being too Hollywood. That aside, this movie was very well put together through multiple departments. The acting was fantastic as is expected from a cast of fantastic actors and actresses, Tom McCarthy did an astounding job directing the film rather surprisingly, the writing was exceptional and it really is a big Best Picture contender.\n\nThe performances in this film were just so damn amazing to see. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Shreiber, Stanley Tucci, and John Slattery all killed it in their roles. This was probably the best ensemble cast of the year as everyone was fully committed and delved deep into their roles to the point where you stop noticing that it is Keaton and Ruffalo. Amongst all the greatness, Mark Ruffalo was still the stand-out performance of the film, watching him act in this film makes me wonder why the guy isn't a bigger actor than he is. It is a shame that most people only think of The Hulk when you mention Ruffalo as he has other roles where he puts in some solid performances. Michael Keaton as always was great, he is one of the best working today so you just know he is going to nail any role you give him. Unfortunately because of the other amazing performances around him he couldn't stand out enough to get a Best Actor nomination but he was very entertaining nonetheless.\n\nThe directing by Tom McCarthy was a surprise for me after i had looked at his previous work. I was unfamiliar with his 3 earlier films so really all i had to go on was last years 'The Cobbler' and well, it didn't have me really excited to see how he does on this film at all. But after seeing the amazing work he did with this film, it is hard to say that the same guy who directed 'The Cobbler' also directed the Best Picture nominated 'Spotlight'. The way he ties this film together and arranges all of the individual stories going on was very impressive to see. For quite a bit of the film you have the various characters all going off and investigating certain aspects of the case, and to be able to follow each one of their journeys in a way that allows you to keep track of everyone and not get lost is a great achievement. I also like the way he paced the film, there were a couple of moments fairly early on where i felt it could pick up the speed a little, but after 30 minutes in it was smooth sailing. But when much of the scenes involve interviews, meetings and scenes of those sorts it is very difficult to try and cover everything without skipping things or boring people, so well done again.\n\nSo in the end, Spotlight is just an amazing movie and manages to remain entertaining for the entire 2 hour runtime. It provides you with many of the facts and information regarding the allegations and mixes that in with a very interesting and entertaining story and film. The performances are all great and definitely worth watching just to see these great actors doing what they do best. I love a good biopic and this is definitely one of them so i highly recommend checking it out. Will it win Best Picture? Although my pick is still 'The Revenant' i would have to say this one of the top 3 nominated that actually has a chance.\n\n9.1/10"

And this movie is about a scandal that involves the Catholic church, and there are these reporters played by Ruffalo, and the rest of the actors who are trying to write a story about the scandal, tracking people down. But there are obstacles in the way. When I first heard about this movie, I had a feeling that this movie has some potential. The trailer looks good, and all I knew is that there is this scandal, and there are these reporters trying to put it together and expose the truth. That was all I knew. So I knew this movie was going to be good. And it is. I'm very impressed. This is one of the best movies I have seen this year. And it's all done by its incredible acting, incredible script, and incredible directing.\n\nThis movie deals with a subject matter involving priests and children. There are victims. And these reporters are just out there collecting information from the people who were involved with it. And some of the victims and their siblings have different reactions, and it could be pretty heart breaking too, because these are people who had to put up with it. And it messes them up psychologically. And to make matters worse, this issue has been going on for a long time, and people already knew about it. But they didn't take the time to speak about it. and throughout the entire movie, you are just watching these reporters, doing their jobs like real people, collecting information. And we as an audience are finding some shocking information that we don't see coming. Some information that makes us cringe, because this is based on a true story. And you just want our reporters to get this clear out of the way, and expose the people involved in this scandal. And then it gets to a point where you feel like that this is not a movie. Sometimes when we watch movies based on true events, we know that it happened. But in the end, you think to yourself, it was just a movie. But in Spotlight, you feel like you are transported into the year of 2001 and 2002, where the movie takes place, and you see our reporters doing what they have to do. And it all helps with our characters.\n\nEveryone did a flawless job in this movie. All of the characters felt very realistic. There wasn't a scene where I felt like I was just watching an actor. You feel like these people are just real life reporters. Michael Keaton,. First you got Birdman, and now this? You just love seeing him on screen. And you just love some of his scenes. and then you got Mark Ruffalo , who did a mind blowing job. He is the one in the group who wants to get this story out there the most. he is running around, going into buildings, getting documents, writing down information, and you just feel the passion of his job. He is the one affected the most about this case. There was this scene, where he and Michael Keaton has this argument, and Ruffalo and his performance was very outstanding.\n\nThis movie is about mystery, and it really really works. Guys, go and check this movie out. It has outstanding and great performances, and great direction. It's one of the best of the year. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out. This movie is pretty flawless...for the most part. There were a few times where the story drags, but you are going to enjoy watching this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This years Academy Award Best Picture line-up was one of the most underwhelming in recent memory, but there was a little cheer when director Tom McCarthy's underdog Spotlight took home the top prize. My personal favourite of the nominees, The Big Short, lost out, and the stand-out film of the year, Inside Out, wasn't even on the list (although it took home the Best Animated Feature), but the lack of truly great films this year doesn't take anything away from Spotlight, which is a riveting little procedural hampered by a surprising emotional distance from the disturbing subject matter.\n\nLike most films set amongst the huddled office meetings, desk- thumping and pen-chewing of the newspaper room, Spotlight takes its inspiration from Alan J. Pakula's seminal All the President's Men (1976), and concerns itself solely on the noble efforts of the staff trying to piece together that big story that will change everything. Here, we're at the Boston Globe in 2001, and the newspapers new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) and almost instantly notices the importance of delving deeper into eccentric lawyer Mitchel Garabedian's (Stanley Tucci) accusation that Cardinal Law (Len Cariou) has covered up the molestation of various children by a priest in their very city.\n\nBaron hands the task to Spotlight, a team consisting of 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian D'Arcy James), who takes months exhaustively researching their subject matter before publishing their findings. What they uncovered were hundreds of cases in Boston alone of child molestation by priests, and the fact that this was ignored by people in a position to do much more. In fact, some of the most powerful moments come from the revelations that some of the Boston Globe staff sat on the story for years without taking notice of the extent of the abuse. With Operation Yewtree still hitting the headlines here in the UK, the subject of sweeping these kinds of cases under the rug couldn't be more relevant.\n\nSpotlight depicts, in breathtaking detail, the work carried out by Robinson and his team to uncover the truth and to obtain the required evidence. Keaton, after last years Birdman, gives another assured performance, and Ruffalo is routinely terrific as the pit- bull Rezendes. Aesthetically, the film cannot be faulted, and McCarthy sticks strictly to the facts. However, the lack of an emotional connection means the film does not induce the kind of anger it really should. Without doubt the movies stand-out scene is Pfeiffer's reaction to a priests blunt response to her equally blunt questioning, and the film should maintain the sort of power and shock this moment inspires, but keeps itself frustratingly distant. Spotlight is still an accomplished piece of work with some sparkling dialogue, and McCarthy hints that he may have found the same form he had with his terrific debut The Station Agent (2003)."

It is a movie which feels grey and real.\n\nIt has the tone of a newspaper, and the gruelling effort that is needed for a story of this calibre.\n\nFrom impeccable acting, this film makes the viewer fully drawn in, emotionally attached to this story and its answers.\n\nIt is not a Fincher movie where the viewer is excited as more of the 'conspiracy' unfolds, as in Zodiac. Also starring Mark Ruffalo. The tone of this move makes unfolding the truth more harrowing, so much so that at certain parts of the movie you feel the need to take a break.\n\nMany parts of the movie will leave a really unsavoury taste in your mouth, it will make you feel sick to the stomach and by the end there feels a sense of relief for the viewer, not just for the crew of journalists.\n\nOverall possible not one of the Greats for its art, but indeed a necessary and powerful one. made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Don't remember the last time I saw a film so undeserving of the outpouring of praise it received. 30 minutes into this thing and it was everything I could do to keep from squirming and going to sleep and doing the dishes and working on my own stuff. I am sick and tired of movies that use the infinitely compelling and tragic topic of child molestation to gather interest, and then the movie does not deliver the goods. One or two lines about a priest telling a little boy to do something sick does not a great movie make. If this had been a Clint Eastwood movie, I guarantee he would have taken us behind closed doors, perhaps even a look at one of the sick, twisted mothers of one of these kids that knew her child was being molested by these nasty priests and did nothing about it for whatever reason. And dear God, where are the NUNS??? Nuns are just as sick and twisted as priests if not more. And maybe, its time for somebody to film the echo of one of these scenes taking place; show us the priest going into the boy's confessional or something. And where are the little girls that were molested? http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ crime-scene/tom-jackman/priest-sentenced-for-molesting.html I am still waiting for a good movie about this topic and this is not the one. Though touching in parts, this movie is well written, well acted BOREDOM. Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, on its worst day, is better."

        "review_title": "The pinnacle of Investigative Journalist filmmaking",
        "review_detailed_main": "Taking the #1 spot in the list for my favorite films of the decade, this Best Picture winning film shines a light on the extraordinary investigative journalists who revealed one of the most disturbing true secrets that the church had been hiding for many years.\n\n\n\nSYNOPSIS: In 2001, the investigative journalist team, known as \"Spotlight\", for the Boston Globe gets tasked with digging deep into a potential scandal of the American Church keeping secrets and hiding child molesting priests. Though at first believed to be just a couple \"bad apples\", the further the team researched, the more they begin to realize that this unimaginable secret is actually being done on a much grander scale.\n\nDIRECTION: Tom McCarthy really knocks this one out of the park. Every angle is a song and every angle is keeping the right amount of pace while tracking every bit of body language coming off of the phenomenal performances. I've been reviewing many films that aren't asked for an extreme amount of effort on behalf of the directing and I'm compelled to say the same about this film. Despite feeling this way, McCarthy shoots this film in a very particular way where it's hard for me to explain. He is always capturing the right frame at the right moment and whether it's a wide, a medium or a close-up it is particular to a point of perfection. I couldn't imagine the editing nor the direction being any different. I don't want it to be any different. The extreme organization of this film is exquisite and regardless if you're familiar with the true story you're still very much discovering every bit of information along with them. Although I can think of several films of the sort, the only other film I can really compare the meticulous direction with is that of David Fincher's \"Zodiac\" (2007).\n\nWRITING: Every element of this film is damn near flawless for me and the same goes for the writing. As I mentioned in my review of Dark Waters (an also similar film including Mark Ruffalo), when writing a script that is inspired or completely based on true events, you can spot the films that truly do their research. Now, I don't know just how accurate this film is to all of the dialogue that was actually said nor do I know what level of investigation these journalists took on, but anyone can see that this film really dug as deep as it could. A story like this could be scary to tell, especially when it's dealing with an enormous entity like the American Church and so I give the writing and anyone participating in this film in general all of the props in the world.\n\nACTING: I'm just going to name all of the noteworthy actors: Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liv Schreiber, Brian D'Arcy James, John Slattery, Billy Crudup, Stanley Tucci and Mark Ruffalo. Now there are others who played very small roles who were all spectacular, but for this film I really want to narrow this SPECTACULAR lineup to Stanley Tucci and Mark Ruffalo. Stanley Tucci plays one of the most incredible supporting roles to date. He was so integral to the story and every line of dialogue that came out of his mouth felt so true that I nearly forgot he is an actor and I know that's the job and that's how it's supposed to be, but in every scene that he was in I nearly felt I was watching a straight documentary with the real lawyer. He was unbelievable. Moving on we get to Mark Ruffalo. Without having seen all of his films, I can say without a doubt this is the best performance he has every given. It's one of the greatest performances given period. One could argue the best of the decade. Maybe this story is so close to his heart or maybe he just sparked unreal-like empathy, but I felt as though this story affected him to his very core. The emotion was so raw that the whole movie I wanted this story to get out just so I could see himself get closure. I wouldn't be surprised at all that even though Mr. Hulk has smashed through several Marvel films that this was his most emotionally and mentally draining performance he's every had.\n\nCONCLUSION: All in all, this film goes down as possibly one of my top 10 favorite films of all time. To take a story, entirely filled with dialogue and to keep my interest as much as a Domino's Chocolate Lava Cake, is speaking to significant heights. I can watch this film daily and still be sucked in just as much as the first viewing and the heart wrenching scene between Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo. Simply Impeccable. This is a recommend to absolutely everyone. I am a man of faith and for me to still enjoy this film as much as it does, I believe speak volumes."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on a true story, Spotlight tells the story of the reporters behind the breaking news report of child molestation and the Catholic Church's cover up in Boston.\n\nPrior to awards season, Spotlight flew under the radar. Sure it has a killer cast and was well reviewed, but it was little known and littler seen. The Boston Globe is at a pivotal point in its existence in the early 2000s. Bought by The Times, staff cuts and uncertainty cause waves of concern for its journalists. A new Editor, an outsider to Boston, is brought in to hopefully lead to positive change for the Globe. His first order of business is to pursue a story left dormant and uninvestigated: that of a priest who allegedly molested boys and the Cardinal and church that knew about it. This story centers on the small staff that write for the Spotlight section of the paper who are assigned the case.\n\nMost of us should be old enough to remember when this article broke and the ripple effect and later ramifications it had on the Catholic Church. The intriguing part of the film Spotlight is that it truly helps you understand the barriers these journalists faced just to get to the truth. This is a city where the Catholic Church has the greatest power and influence of any American city, permeating its reach into the political system. The lengths these individuals went to prevent the story ever being researched, let alone published, were against them.\n\nSpotlight manages to showcase journalistic quandaries, ethical dilemmas, legal exploitations, and dense information regarding a complicated investigation into this systemic broach of trust all while doing so in an engaging way. Spotlight is coherent and approachable without ever being flat or verbose, a testament to a phenomenal script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. Furthermore, Signer and McCarthy are able to tell a story that spans across decades without using schticky flashbacks or overly stylized crutches and instead tell a simple chronological but gripping story.\n\nPart of the reason Spotlight feels so real is that, well, it is. Based on a true story, it is beyond evident that the actors (Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Brian d'Arcy James) took the assignment of playing real life individuals seriously. Rather than exaggerating characteristics for effect which ultimately is detrimental to a film, the atmosphere of the staff of Spotlight reels like a group that has been together for years. Each character is unique but honest, well formed and have believably consistent actions and relationships with one another.\n\nAt its core, Spotlight succeeds in its simplicity of storytelling. With a narrative laid out from real life events, it had all the makings of a great film. Of course, that has been true of other films which have failed miserably so it's nice to see a movie such as Spotlight to live up to its potential and rise to the occasion.\n\n7.5/10\n\nPlease check out the Archon Cinema Reviews website for full reviews of all the Academy Award nominees."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a big fan of investigative films, with recent-ish efforts like \"Zodiac\" and \"The Insider\" immediately coming to mind as favorites. \"All The President's Men\", of course, is the industry standard for this type of filmmaking. \"Spotlight\" can easily hold its own with all those great films.\n\nFor a basic plot summary, \"Spotlight\" tells the story of the investigative crew of the Boston Globe who unearthed a large child abuse scandal (clergy molesting children) that was being covered up by the Catholic Church. Reporters played by Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and John Slattery all combine to pry the lid off of the scandal through diligent reporting and copious research.\n\nWhat I really like about \"Spotlight\" is how it presents the material almost without \"editorial comment\" (to steal an apt newspaper phrase). This isn't so much a movie about the Catholic Church scandal (though implicitly it can be read as such, I guess) as it is a film about the journalistic/investigative process needed to unearth such facts. As such, there really is very little verbal or explicit moralizing that takes place on screen. Instead, director Tom McCarthy lets the process unspool and allows the viewer to form their own emotions as each new thread is pulled.\n\nOf course, it always helps to have such a who's who of acting talent, and they all work perfectly here. They each bring something unique to the film while also functioning as a competent whole.\n\n\"Spotlight\" can be a hard movie to watch at times (the subject matter, without being visually graphic, is difficult to digest), but it ends up being an important treatise on the power of journalism and investigation to reign in the power of establishments that feel they might be above the law. Whether you go to Mass every week or think religion is a bunch of hog-wash, you will still be affected by the message of this film.\n\nAs such, I now better understand why \"Spotlight\" took home Best Picture at the 2016 Academy Awards. Simply put, it is an expertly-crafted film, filled with excellent acting, that also tells an important story. What more can one ask for in a dramatic film?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight is a film that will most definitely make a mark on whoever watches it. It covers a group of journalists who accidentally uncover a horrific abuse system among a church, while investigating sexual abuse allegations against a priest. Over 80 little boys were molested within the Roman Catholic Church, and it was all hidden from the public for years.\n\nWhen covering such a dark subject matter as this movie, things tend to get sugar coated and unrealistic. However, Spotlight is horrifyingly straight to the point (in the best way possible). There is no doubt that the plot is solid and stays consistent throughout the entire film. It will feel like you have been hit with reality and get you really thinking about how cruel a world unknown to most could be. One scene in particular that I could not get over was when the journalists were all trying to finish their first story by Christmas while children in a church were singing silent night in the background.\n\nThe color palette and cinematography in this film do not distract you from the tragic plot. It consists of muted colors, simple camera shots, and natural lighting. It feels so authentic, that the dark plot only feels more heartbreaking and reminds you that this happened to real people. Rachel McAdams, the star of several hit movies such as Mean Girls and the Notebook, was one of the determined journalists that put on a great performance in Spotlight. The acting quality was so raw and impactful, it's impossible to forget."

Of course, the Boston Globe did this, by unearthing the facts and breaking the story in the first place, but seeing their efforts brought to the big screen with such tact and heart is a testament to filmmaker's desire to make important films. I applaud their efforts... and everyone should see this movie. And if you rated this movie poorly because of your religious beliefs, then shame on you."

There are some abrupt cuts and lack of transitions which make the movie feel too quick, giving some of the more dramatic scenes not enough time to breathe. Most of the performances from the cast are incredibly restrained and the characters never truly go through any substantial change because the focus is more on the story events. This is great if you are interested in the real events that inspired the story, but it unfortunately makes the characters feel flat. Luckily the cast has enough natural charisma to make it at least a little engaging. All of this is capped off with an abrupt and lackluster ending. While technically well made, I feel the entertainment factor is lacking unless you have an interest in the real events that inspired the movie."

It was really interesting seeing a story from the reporters side and how they get their information. Really no Complaints with this movie and was an understanding choice for best picture.\n\nI am personally Catholic and am very serious about my faith and I thought this movie did a great job not completely crapping on faith or the Catholic Church itself and showed how flawed the church as an institution can be and how people even ones deemed holy are flawed and can be even evil. I respect what the movie did and any Catholic who truly has a relationship with Christ should see this movie as well told and a positive thing for faith. I was impressed. 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Patience is key in the world of investigative journalism, a fact highlighted in Spotlight, the brilliant biographical drama from director Tom McCarthy. The same man who brought us The Cobbler last year has certainly made major amends with this compelling drama that tells the true story of the revelation that shook the Catholic Church to its core.\n\nWhen Marty Baron (Live Schreiber) was hired as the new editor of The Boston Globe in 2001, he discovered the Spotlight Team, headed by Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (Michael Keaton), a small group of investigative journalists who can take up to a year to publish a story, consisting of Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) and Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery).\n\nAfter reading a column about a local Boston priest who was sexually abusing children and the Archbishop of Boston, who chose to ignore these crimes, Baron urges the Spotlight Team to investigate the story. Initially thinking they are investigating a one-off case, the team soon uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and the ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese.\n\nHaving spent a semester at university studying investigative journalism, I absolutely loved how Tom McCarthy told the story of this team of reporters who slowly start to uncover the horrific truth buried beneath the Catholic Church, piece by piece. McCarthy's film, co-written by Josh Singer, doesn't hold back when it comes to its sensitive subject matter; a story we may not want to hear but one that needed to be heard.\n\nThe shock of the revelations are really felt through the screenplay and the character journeys we see throughout, particularly that of Rezendes. I was left shaking my head at some of the truths revealed about the local Boston priests however, I was left open-mouthed at the facts that closed the film. I just could not believe the sheer scale of what had been uncovered.\n\nComing to the performances, Spotlight really does boast one hell of an impressive ensemble cast. Each of them work well with the screenplay from McCarthy and Singer, delivering good performances however, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are the ones that really excel in Spotlight. Ruffalo picks up yet another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and is probably the main challenge to Sylvester Stallone, while Rachel McAdams really does earn her maiden Academy Award nomination in the role of Sacha Pfeiffer.\n\nThe score from Howard Shore impressed me as well. I really felt Shore captured the disturbing side of the investigation while also managing to emphasise the determined work ethic of the Spotlight Team. There's also an eerily brilliant use of the song Silent Night towards the end that deserves a mention.\n\nIt may not possess the cinematography of The Revenant or the heart of Creed however, Spotlight is an equally powerful and important film that has to be seen. I really do hope it walks away with the Academy Award for Best Picture come the end of this month."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a difficult movie to watch - a movie that will make you truly angry, even if you aren't Catholic. It details the work of a group of investigative reporters with the Boston Globe in the late 1990's and early 2000's to expose the sexual abuse scandals of the Roman Catholic Church in Boston. Now, today, we hear so much about the sexual abuse of minors by priests that I fear we've become hardened to it. It doesn't seem to shock us anymore. But at that time most of this was unknown to most people - covered up by Church officials who just kept moving pedophile priests from parish to parish and settling with abuse victims out of court to protect the image of the church; used by lawyers who presumably made a comfortable living off the negotiated settlements; swept under the carpet by officials ranging from police officers to judges who turned their eyes away because they were Catholic themselves; ignored or minimized by the media when stories did leak out. It's a story about an out of control institution and the power of the Roman Catholic Church - not a wild eyed conspiracy type of story, but a raw, down to earth story about what was (and is) essentially a conspiracy to try to get the Church off the hook for the abuse committed by its clergy. This is a powerful story that makes you shake your head in disgust and contempt.\n\nThe movie opens with a brief account of an abused boy in 1976, and a visit by Cardinal Bernard Law to his family to work something out so that nothing goes public. So we're exposed right away to the fact that the Church cared more about itself and its reputation than about its victims. Then we jump into the story of the journalistic investigation. The strong suggestion of the movie is that none of this might have come out except for the fact that in early 2001 the Globe hired a new editor - Marty Baron (played by Liev Schrieber.) Baron was not from Boston. Baron was not Catholic. Baron was not Christian - he was Jewish. Basically, he had no stake in covering this up and so he demanded that his investigative team plow ahead with its work, with the goal being not just to find individual cases of abuse but to find out what the systemic problem was and how far up the hierarchy it went. Michael Keaton played the head of the \"Spotlight\" team - a team of Globe reporters who work solely on investigative journalism - ably supported by Mark Ruffalo, Brian D'Arcy James and Rachel McAdams as the team. The performances were superb, but this movie really isn't about the performances. It's about the story itself. You really didn't need well known names for this - the story drives the movie forward, as the scandal grows and grows - cover up after cover up. From a handful of priests involved to 13, to 90 all the way up the hierarchy of the archdiocese itself until it finally reaches the door of Cardinal Law himself (played by Len Cariou.) Many of the victims are found and interviewed. Some of their stories, while not incredibly graphic, are still sickening. And the movie ends with a huge list of places in the United States and around the world where sex abuse scandals have hit the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe story proceeds both slowly and deliberately - and provides a fair bit of detail into the investigation. In that sense it's also an interesting look at investigative journalism. But in the end it leaves you angry. I am a Christian and I am clergy - not Roman Catholic but Protestant and married with a daughter, but this still hits home even if I'm not part of that tradition. It is horrifying and outrageous. The abuse of the trust that parents placed in these priests only to have that trust abused in the worst possible way is shocking. I firmly believe that the vast majority of Roman Catholic priests are fine and faithful men who do not and would never abuse children. And the problem of abuse of trust is not restricted to the Roman Catholic Church by any means. But this story and the many, many scandals that have erupted since do point to a systemic problem in the Roman Catholic Church that seems to be out of control, and a larger than would be expected number of pedophiles within the priesthood.\n\nIt is truly difficult to find anything much to criticize about this. It's a first rate, well done movie that sadly remains entirely relevant and will probably remain relevant for some time to come. (10/10)"

Now, due to the convenience of information dissemination and access brought by the Internet, the professional aura of traditional journalists has faded away, and we can only enjoy their persistence, integrity and sense of honor in the film. At present, the sensitivity and tentacles of many journalists lag behind the network \"we media\". The traditional media is on the wane, and talents are flowing to the network media. News reports can be spread all over the Internet in minutes. News can only get cheaper, shallower, headline-grabbing, sensationalist. The film offers a wonderful group performance, which highlights the charm of character in a slightly flat plot."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: Although I found the subject matter touching and pretty upsetting at times, and all of the actors put in a great performance, from an entertainment point of view, it seemed more like a documentary than a cinematic extravaganza, and I really wanted to see the priest's get punished for all of there nasty acts. I'm glad that the director used top actors to portray such a touching story, about a group of journalist, who work for the Boston Globe, and go to extreme lengths to undercover the terrible true story about priest who rape young kids. The fact that the important documents were hidden away, was truly disgusting, and the poor victims, who were mostly damaged for life, also touched me. You do have to be in the right mood to watch this film because it is very one toned and it is one of those movies that will leave you feeling angry and pretty emotional. As for the performances, all of the actors gave this delicate subject, there all, and it shows journalist in a different light, by proving that they also can do good without uncovering a scoop, just for profit. Personally, I don't think that it's one of those films that you can watch time and time again but it's still a well made movie, which brings an untold story to light. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up: I'm not sure that this film deserved a Best Picture Academy Award, especially with Mad Max and the Revenant in the same category but you can't fault the film for emotion, and the script is well written. Personally I don't think that it needed to be 2 hours long and I did find some of the scenes repetitive but with that aside, it's still one to watch and it's great to see Keaton back on top form. The movie was directed and written by Tom McCarthy, 49, who also brought you the Station Agent, The Visitor, Win Win and the disappointing, the Cobbler, so this movie was a complete change of directed for the actor/director, who recently starred in Pixels with Adam Sandler. He was brave to make a movie about a subject matter which has been kept under the radar for some time, and I'm sure that there are still people out there that won't accept the truth but I personally think that there was room for Tom to go deeper, from the punishment perspective. Its still a decent film which deserved recognition but I did see better films in 2015/2016.\n\nBudget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $88.3million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/history/dramas starring Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Elena Wohl and Brian D'Arcy James. 6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on a true story: In the early 2000s, a team of reporters at the Boston Globe investigate several incidents of Catholic priests sexually abusing children.\n\n\"Spotlight\" works well on many levels and not just for its main story of finding the shocking facts. It also reveals that universal and timeless evil known as the 'conspiracy of silence' that occurs within establishments. In this particular story, the conspiracy is not only within the Catholic Church but also within the upper echelons of Boston society. Another fact of human nature is also revealed: in any closed society, it often takes outsiders to make necessary changes.\n\nThe film also sheds light on a group of people rarely exposed in movies: lapsed Catholics i.e. those raised in the religion but who became discouraged by grave misconduct at higher levels of the church hierarchy. It turns out that all of the reporters are in this situation and there is a fascinating scene in which they discuss their backgrounds and how this might affect their approach to their investigation.\n\nThe first half is filled with energy with much inter-cutting among scenes. The highlight is a cross-cut of two scenes involving interviews with abuse survivors - one straight, one gay. In these scenes, the language is refreshingly blunt and revealing. A later scene involving an interview with a priest is even more shocking. The actors playing the survivors and the priest are also powerful in their brief roles.\n\nThe second half is still good but it tends to lag a bit. It seems like time to wrap up but more issues keep getting piled on. One is a scene involving a conflict on the newspaper team. The benefit of this scene is that it shows the best of Mark Ruffalo who gives the most passionate performance among a very fine cast. The downside is that the scene feels like an unnecessary extension to the movie.\n\nThis movie is rightly being compared to \"All the President's Men\" as a great journalist story. It can also be compared to the superb Canadian film \"The Boys of St. Vincent\" (1992) for exposing clergy child abuse. \"Spotlight\" is a fine film that may not meet all expectations; but it must be given credit for its courage and boldness."

The script, direction and acting are excellent. Can't wait to see a film soon about how dogged, moral, heroic journalists bring down the current corrupt presiden and his enablers."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"How do you say no to God?\" This is the question that Spotlight at its heart battles with. The answer though is nowhere to be found. There is not a simple explanation and this is the way that Director Tom McCarthy and writer Josh Singer treat the material, with thought, care and complexity.\n\n2001. Pre 9/11. The internet is about to explode. Newspapers are seen as the lesser of the two mediums and the Boston Globe is on the brink of uncovering the truth about Catholic Priests who have been molesting and raping children for years. Everyone else turns a blind eye to the truth, including the church that silences anyone who tries to speak out against them. The Boston Globe assigns a special investigative team 'Spotlight' to help bring justice to the hundreds of victims who don't just originate from Boston, but the entire world.\n\nIt would have been all too easy to lose sight of the characters in Spotlight and that was my biggest fear. However, we never lose sight of them for a moment. The main players are Walter Robinson (Keaton), Mike Rezendes (Ruffalo) and Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams). I did not need any more convincing from Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams, that they are actors at the top of their game; especially Ruffalo who surprised me further, even after his excellent characterisation in Foxcatcher. He truly is the star of the show, subtly brilliant without drawing attention. Actors like him deserve to be commended.\n\nWhere does Spotlight excel the most though? That would be the writing, separating itself from the majority of Biopics and Dramas on the market that are sloppy, predictable and quite frankly a mess. The scripting is dynamic and killer lines sprinkled throughout help convey the drama to audiences, like myself who would never have believed that such horrific events really did happen. We are reminded (but not bludgeoned over the head repeatedly) by the facts. McCarthy handles the film gracefully. Admittedly a shock, when his last project was The Cobbler.\n\nBut Spotlight is absorbing cinema, that shocks to the core, never succumbing to the usual clich\u00e9s, is dramatic and riveting without ever patronising its audience. When was the last time a Director achieved this with this much trust? Many other Directors would make a film that felt dramatically contrived, even though these events really did happen. The power of a great Director is to make the material excel and go beyond what could have potentially been dramatically inert and lifeless. Spotlight is always moving forward in interesting and meaningful ways. The performances and writing only account for a small percentage of the film's brilliance.\n\nAt first glance Spotlight is a film shot simply without an all- encompassing cinematic feel; upon further inspection though it's a beautifully dark and sinister film. With shots that linger on the performances, always cutting away at the right moment and frames that echo the superb brilliance of the famous opening shot from The Godfather. The slow reveal.\n\nI honestly could go on and on about Spotlight because it really is a great film. It's also a rare film that changes the way you perceive the world and the people around you, without feeling exploitative. A statement that is applicable to very few of the films I have seen. Biopics do not get as captivating, thought provoking, emotional and gripping as Spotlight. Why would you miss this? It demands your attention and needs to be seen. It's a true story about real people and real problems we are still facing today, relevant now more than ever. It never feels phony, fake or begging for awards nominations (which it so rightfully deserves). It builds upon everything that comes before its 128 minute runtime and offers up a conclusion that is heart stopping. Not to mention tremendous support from Ruffalo, McAdams and Keaton who bring further emotional weight to the film. All of which contribute to Spotlight standing as one of the greatest films of the decade, if not all time.\n\nA+"

It gets it because of its beautiful acting and its beautifully told story. What surprised me the most was the fact that it only won two Oscars. I mean sure it won Best Picture, but all the acting awards it was nominated for they did not win. The 88th Academy Awards had Leonardo DiCaprio for Best Actor, Mark Rylance for Best Supporting Actor, Brie Larson for Best Actress, and Alicia Vikander for Best Supporting Actress. So I can see why it did not win any of the Acting Oscars. Even though it had some amazing performances I guess that does not mean it wins them. Spotlight got snubbed at the Golden Globes, which I do not agree with, the gave the Award for Best Motion Picture-Drama to The Revenant. This does not help the fact that I already hate the Golden Globes. This makes me hate them even more, so good job. Mark Ruffalo delivers the audience a phenomenal acting job. He did get an Oscar nomination but he did not win it. Rachel McAdams got the other nomination but did not win it ( sadly) but again there was no way that Spotlight could win any of the acting awards. Spotlight is super depressing but it is so well made that you feel an emotional bond to these characters, so good job on the writing, and hay, they won the Oscar for Best Writing-Original Screenplay. This movie makes you suddenly get more cautious of the fact that, you might live next to or go to church with child molesters. Spotlight is rated R for some language including sexual references ( official MPAA rating). You could show your kids this when they are about thirteen maybe fourteen. This movie is on the list of movies you have to watch sometime in your life. You will probably watch it if you go to film school. Spotlight is the best 21st Century Best Picture. I give Spotlight an A+, for its beautiful acting and its beautifully told story."

I found this to be a little sterile despite the fact that his had people like Mark Ruffalo , Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams in the cast. Perhaps they were just a little bit too \" Hollywood\" to be playing the parts of these reporters because I never really bought into their performances. John Slattery was the best thing in this because I actually believed he was Ben Bradlee Jr. This is another film that surprises me that it got nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards because there are better films than this that missed out."

Worst move of 2015 Revenant to second worst movie of 2015 Spotlight.\n\nNote to self:do not listen to professional critics, trust your gut instinct. You always have to wander out of the comfort zone...stick to your local films and foreign language films.\n\nI shake my head in wonder at how this movie managed to get an Oscar. There is very little truth to the story, another paper had broken the story earlier and also it was already well known by the time the Globe jumped on board.\n\nIt was like watching a news segment that lasts 2 hours. I'll watch Fox News for two hours if I want my news fiddled with and most likely end up with the same feeling of regret. At least it would be free. The actors did not gel in my opinion, there were some fine actors in the ensemble but something just didn't click."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I watched this movie it was like watching myself. The survivor of such horrendous abuse, to then being silenced like it was nothing. I watched and nodded along to the actors portraying the survivors.\n\nBut for me it was not the Catholic church that covered up my abuse. It was another religious group. What got me in this story was, that it was not just me it happened to. This is OUR story. It has been going on for decades. Probably even before media was a thing in a world where children were meant to be seen and not heard.\n\nI believe that children should be seen and equally heard. The monster for me was not meant to be my leader or my father (biological father sad but true) The monster was meant to be the imaginary being under my bed.\n\nThe movie itself was fantastic, and maybe it's because I am a survivor I don't know, but felt connected to the story. It is rare for movies to do that to me. The actors playing these roles were absolutely amazing. I like Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams anyway. I like Michael Keaton and remember him in the movies that I was not allowed to watch as a child through the 80's-90's, because of magic and the cult rules I was forced into, yet caught up with them in my adulthood. Michael is a phenomenal actor. He takes the serious role in this well and plays it well, in direct contrast to Beetlejuice.\n\nIf anyone is thinking of watching Spotlight and has not done so yet, I highly recommend it. As a survivor just be prepared for possible triggers along the way, but know that you can also say #ME Too and that we are not alone."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's no slowing down with the excellent films out in the early part of 2016 and here we have an Oscar Nominated film based on the true story of the Boston Global discovering the huge cover up of child molestation within the Catholic Church, a hugely controversial and sobering subject.\n\nAfter a brief scene from 1974 the film takes us to 2001 where the Boston Globe's Spotlight team are charged with investigating the allegation of historical sexual abuse by a Catholic priest on a minor. The whole story is gripping but you can't help feeling saddened that this could have been allowed to go on and worse still denied, covered up and families paid off by the Catholic Church. It's unbelievably flabbergasting.\n\nThe actors here are superbly cast, each delivering a sterling performance but a special nod has to go to Michael Keaton who, since his resurgence in Birdman, has found his former glory and is on outstanding form here. I'm also a big fan of Mark Ruffalo and whilst initially finding his performance uncomfortable it grew on me and by the end appreciated how much individuality and passion he brings to his role. Also worth mentioning Liev Schreiber (playing Marty Baron, the editor) who whilst isn't that well known delivers an brilliant performance, I'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his future roles.\n\nOverall it's a superb film covering an extremely saddening topic and as the credits role you do feel somewhat shocked at the extent of the abuse and the lengths the Catholic Church have gone to cover it up. It's not going to be for everyone, I imagine some people would rather just not know, but if you're remotely interested then it's definitely worth seeing."

The story is a very important one and the unfolding of the layers of the scandal was hard to believe. I would've liked a consideration of more perspectives, as it was just from the Globe's perspective and didn't really get into the conflict they dealt with, just the straightforward pursuit of information and proof. The pacing was also a bit strange, with lots of build and then an oddly rushed third act that made it feel like there wasn't really a climax. It's a well-done and gripping movie, but the single perspective and imperfect third act keep Spotlight from being a great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Did I miss something? I saw Spotlight, I watched it while hoping to appreciate it as the Best Picture of the year. Rachel McAdams got a highly-coveted Oscar nomination, Michael Keaton was enjoying his comeback, and Mark Ruffalo got to channel his offscreen personality of fighting for social causes.\n\nBy the nature of the title, the film was supposed to put a spotlight on a hidden, horrifying problem. But where was the spotlight? It was so watered down, it felt like Part One of a ten-part series, only the rest of the drama wound up on the cutting room floor. The opportunity was there, and all screenwriters Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer had to do was grab out for it. Not only was it a true story, akin to All the President's Men, but even if it didn't mirror the Boston Globe's reporting, it still would have had enough scandal to truly shock audiences. Was there anyone out there who was actually surprised by the reveal of priest molestation within American Catholic churches? By 2015, everyone knew about this, so the movie needed to give more horrific details or dig a little deeper to accomplish its goal. Instead, pretty much the entire movie consisted of the reporters talking to each other in their cubicles. The dialogue had a natural patter to it, with unedited stammers and interruptions, but it felt like a self-righteous, wordy play you'd see on Broadway. If the film was going to shed light on a terrible topic, there were so many more stories it could have featured.\n\nI loved the cast and would have flocked to the theaters to see any movie with the three leads, Stanley Tucci, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James, and Liev Schrieber, but I was incredibly disappointed by the tameness of this movie. I didn't want to see anything graphic or disturbing - the subject matter was disturbing enough - but I was expecting a little less talk and more action. Remember how painstakingly slow the first half hour All the President's Men was? Imagine if the movie never actually accomplished anything, and Woodward and Bernstein just talked about their articles all the time. If you haven't seen Spotlight, you're not missing much."

Whether about a political scandal like in 'All the President's Men,' a war scandal like in 'The Post' or a religious scandal like in 'Spotlight,' these films have the ingredients needed to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. 'Spotlight' in particular is a standout thanks to the A-list cast and the difficult storytelling required given the somber subject matter.\n\nA best picture and best original screenplay winner, 'Spotlight' truly earned these accolades thanks to Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer for outstanding writing. As we've seen many times before, a film can have a great ensemble, but they can easily fall flat if the writing isn't top-notch. Here, we see the likes of Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci build on each others' talents as the Boston Globe Spotlight team does its best to get to the bottom of the Boston Archdiocese's decades-long coverup of priest sexual abuse.\n\nAgain, this is heavy stuff, but the way the pieces come together is really remarkable. Ruffalo's no-BS portrayal of reporter Mike Rezendes is a particular highlight, as he clearly will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of the story. Keaton also does an admirable job as the spotlight team leader - his background making things more complicated as he tries to navigate the tangled web that is the \"system\" in place between Boston politics and the Catholic Church.\n\nThere are some films that just stand on their own two feet without needing explanation for their brilliance. 'Spotlight' is definitely one of those."

I can see why this film won an Academy Award for best writing and original screen play, also the performances brought on by Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and Michael Keaton were fantastic. Being that this film is a true story it was disturbing how the Catholic Church went about covering up the scandal. While watching this film I was in awe.

Spotlight is based on true events that will shock you from inside to outside and it is also the possibility that it might take a few moments for you to come out of the shock (as it did to me). Cinema is just not a medium of entertainment, experiments and money spinner flicks but it is Medium that shows you an unknown and untold reality which is important for you to live in the society. Spotlight is a story about Child abusing events which had been covered by religious demons and some media freaks for the sake of God's status. Then, one media house took an interest into it and discovered some mind shaking realities which led them to the core of thier mind and involved them emotionally. Spotlight is not at all melodramatic, even though it had the all the potential to run around emotional spinner and make it a tear-jerker. Tom McCarthy didn't think that way, he kept it away from cinematic elements, he chose realistic theme and I don't know somehow it still brought tears in eyes for a moment. He didn't even try to showcase the big cast as heroes or saviours. McCarthy believed on his writing and made it heroic rather than anything else in the film. Among all the films won Oscars in the kast decade Spotlight was one real deserving holder. I hate Oscars for being manipulative so many times though, it wouldn't have made any difference to me. Also i found Spotlight as one of the most Important and Essential Classic made in Hollywood. This film needs to be seen to know some insane facts and we need to take a step forward to support such disasters if occurred anytime in future. I wanted to say more about many scenes in the film but i don't want to give any spoilers so just watch it and there's not a single chance of you disliking it. One of the Best Films of The Decade. Period.. A Masterpiece !\n\nRATING - 9/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

The film follows the Spotlight team of the Boston Globe as they forage and delve down all possible avenues to uncover the story hidden for so many years. We share the horror and the disbelief as the scale of the cover ups come to light and get an insight as to how a good journalistic team can work together to find the correct facts and the best time and way to present them to the public.

With subject matter so infuriating and gut-wrenching, it would have been easy for writer-director Tom McCarthy to create a good versus evil arc and give the audience a clear-cut bad guy to despise and deplore. But McCarthy opts for a more intelligent route and keeps the individual offending priests faceless (barring one unsettling and revelatory scene), instead homing in on the atrocities committed by the institution. Unravelling like a journalistic thriller sans the glee, Spotlight is an insightful, methodical and utterly compelling film that provides a window not only into the earth-shattering monstrosities at its core, but also into the mechanics and minutiae of old-school reporting. Understanding that the interactions between the key players is critical to maintaining a level of reality in what would otherwise seem completely unbelievable (despite being true), McCarthy keeps his direction unflashy, allowing the high calibre cast to flourish. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Brian d'Arcy James, Live Schreiber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci are all at the top of their games with fleshed out and layered performances that favour subtlety over grandstanding. Spotlight is a brilliantly told true story that captivates from beginning to end, deserving each of its six Academy Award nominations and a place on everybody's must-see list."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this film with high expectations, as the warmly favourable criticisms published on the media together with the viewers' ratings in IMDb seemed to unanimously commend it as one of the best films of the year. Overall I was rather disappointed. Not that I did not enjoy the film, but I thought that its making was kind of perfunctionary, not as gripping and involving as its subject allowed for. What I mean is that there was no suspense at all. Its documentary style simply displayed and unfolded the facts in a kind of smooth monotonous way. Indeed the real story which it tells is terribly shocking and heart-wrenching by itself, but it was dealt with without much passion or cinematic warmth. I think that the film is sustained only by two elements, which at least are strong enough to make it enjoyable: the story and the cast. The performances of all the actors are outstanding in this film, the best on my view being those by Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci. Apart from that, not a specially remarkable movie. sorry to disagree with the majority opinion."

        "review_title": "Handling a Tough Issue",
        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight centers a journalism team that tries to expose a scandal over Catholic churches. It takes dilemmas to show this story to the people that could bring a serious vulnerable effect at the culture of Boston. The movie showcases how impacting the work is, that it's not easy to just release a story in public, especially as devastating as this one. We explore their practicalities and ethics at handling this case, that it took a year for them to expose. Every detail of this process is done with excellent pace, disclosing every bit of information that is hidden by vulnerable people and giving intriguing arguments on how everyone will be ready to hear this story. Spotlight is powerful by just how smart it depicts the complexity of journalism.\n\nThe movie doesn't necessarily go against the religion or anything. Their targets are nothing more than the suspects. It takes an argument that despite that the priests are supposed to be respected for their spiritual commitment, hiding the dark truth behind their crimes would be an abuse of both the law and their power in their creed. There is not a good guy or bad guy labeling between the reporters and the church, it's basically just them fighting to find the truth from people who are hiding it for the sake of protecting either one's dignity or a victim's security. But the tougher choice is deciding when do they have to publish this story, especially close to the events of 9/11, which was a huge hindrance since it's the time when people who lost hope needed comfort from their faith.\n\nBut the movie isn't always stick-in-the-mud in this subject. There's some sense of humor when it asks for it. It also allows the characters to be developed, expressing how their job has taken over their personal lives and how suing the church is a big deal to them due to how Catholicism means to their childhood or loved ones. The film just lets it all engaging than just a series of information. The direction just lets us see how their reporting work in a quite compelling way; the uneasy confessions of the victims, the revelation of the amount of suspect priests, convincing. The acting is outstanding; mostly from Mark Ruffalo to Michael Keaton, the talents just shine at every moment they're in.\n\nSpotlight, among the nominees, is the less showy one, but it acknowledges that it's the story it's handling is what makes it powerful. It's more about the hard work journalists go through rigorously finding facts and responsibility of sharing them at the right time. And how it profoundly handles this hot-button issue also made it fascinating. Slick direction keeps things engrossing, smart writing made it engaging and an amazing cast is just entertaining. Spotlight is a magnetic insight of the busier side of journalism."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight ( 9 out of 10) Everyone has pet peeves when it comes to movies. We hate romantic comedies based entirely on misunderstandings, we hate horror films where no one's cell phone works, or we simply hate movies that have either the word Adam or Sandler on the poster.\n\nI hate true story movies that simply make things up. You know the type. We need a bad guy so let's take a real person and turn him into a racist (Hidden Figures), a murderer (Titanic), or a woman (Patch Adams). We need to condense the timeline and change real historical events (Oscar-nominated Hidden Figures again). We need to change the character's sexuality so modern audiences can relate (The Danish Girl). We need fascist slaveholders to talk about democracy and freedom (300). And the list goes on and on. This is without even mentioning Mel Gibson historical dramas that might as well have dinosaurs wandering through them.\n\nOne of my other pet peeves? Movies that take place in an office or business world made by people who clearly have never spent more than a day working in one. Like ahistorical true stories, this is ripe territory for rage. We have the office politics of Catwoman's evil beauty cream manufacturer. Not to be outdone the less said about how Wayne Industries is run ( a publicly traded company mind you) in the Batman universe the better. It isn't just superhero movies either. Romantic comedies often need a trip to HR and no making everyone an architect does not solve that. (Seriously do these movies even know what architects or museum directors or magazine publishers actually do during their work day?)\n\nSpotlight easily could have fallen into both these traps. It simply doesn't. The timeline is correct. The discussions between professionals sound well professional. There are no made up heavy's to create drama, no fake romantic love interest, no surprise terrorist attack. Okay, it does have the last one but in all fairness, the movie's timeline starts in August 2001 and runs through the end of the year. But even in that moment, the movie handles it with intelligence and in a realistic manner.\n\nThere is a calmness and a professionalism in this movie that is refreshing. It rings true in both the big and small things. It is one of the best films I have seen this year."

The actors, especially Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and Rachel McAdams, brought their characters to life in such a way that their determination and humanity truly resonated with me. Ruffalo's portrayal of Michael Rezendes, with his passion and pursuit of justice, left a profound impact on me.\n\nHowever, watching this film is not easy. Seeing the systemic cover-up of child abuse within the Catholic Church is incredibly painful. Each new piece of information is deeply disturbing, and it makes you feel the horrific experiences of the victims. The film's realism and honesty vividly highlight the seriousness of this issue and its impact on society.\n\n\"Spotlight\" is not just a journalistic triumph, but a powerful reminder of the importance of pursuing truth and social justice. Throughout the film, I was constantly reminded of the crucial role the media plays in society and the importance of holding powerful institutions accountable If you're looking for a deeply moving, powerful, and challenging story, \"Spotlight\" is the film for you. Watching this movie means witnessing not only the unveiling of a scandal but also the triumph of humanity and integrity. It's a painful but absolutely essential viewing experience.

        "review_title": "A Triumph of Investigative Journalism",
        "review_detailed_main": "In today's click-bait internet media culture it's easy to forget that behind every large credible story there is a reporter who did the legwork to find sources, do the research and occasionally act with editorial restraint. In Spotlight's case it was a group of dedicated reporters that blew the lid off of the Boston Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal that rocked an entire institution to its core. Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Walter Robinson (Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams) and Matt Carol (d'Arcy) were those reporters and Spotlight is their story to bring the scandal to press.\n\nThe story is not altogether a very glamorous one. The offices of the Spotlight team (the oldest investigative journalism team in the country) resembles the opaque basement bullpen of a third rate claims adjustment outfit. There are mountains of paper scattered atop shrinking desks anchored by outdated computers. All the reporters who call this office home are locals, well versed in Red Sox trivia, where to get the best pizza, and have had experiences growing up with the Church's influence. So when new Head Editor, and admitted outsider Marty Baron (Schreiber) asks Spotlight to investigate allegations of sexual abuse in the church, you can imagine their apprehension. That apprehension is overstated at first by Assistant Managing Editor Ben Bradlee Jr. (Slattery), then the victims start coming in and the Church starts to take notice.\n\nMany movies about large conspiracies unravel in a hyperbolic web of conceits. This is immediately followed by the perfunctory veiled threat on the part of the conspirators. Yet here, the plot is deliberate and very interested in the small salient details that define newspaper journalism at its best. \"This strikes me as an essential story for a local paper,\" says the pensive Baron as he finally convinces Robinson to take the story and run with it. It is at that moment we as the audience feel the necessity of their actions and their ink; they write the story because locals are in the best position to do so and if they don't no one else will.\n\nThere are also no veiled threats on the part of the church yet we still feel their looming influence in nearly every scene. Every time one of the Globes reporters is gumshoeing on the streets we always see a steeple somewhere in the background. When Baron meets the infamous Cardinal Law (Cariou) in his estate office you feel the man's affluence as everything is tinged with an auburn hue and seemingly dipped in gold. The offices of the Globe is filled with lapsed Catholics yet everywhere in their personal lives there are hints of the Church's influence on their upbringing. Pfeiffer makes a habit of going to Church on Sunday with her mother, Rezendes always assumed he could go back to the fold and be accepted with open arms, Robinson himself was the product of a Catholic School education, a fact that is thrown in his face when the story's deadline looms. All have a crisis of faith not just in Catholicism but faith in humanity. When Carol realizes one the psychology centers for wayward priests resides in his neighborhood he walks down the street and stares down the house with suspicion and contempt.\n\nThen there are the victims. In one pivotal scene Bradlee, is shocked to find there are thirteen innocents that were abused by priests, all of which are still in circulation. It is only later that we even begin to understand the full extent of the damage done lest to say it is far more than thirteen in Boston alone. Besieged Lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Tucci) who specializes in these kinds of unfortunate cases said it best when asked how something like this was allowed to go on for so long. \"If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse them. That's the truth of it.\"\n\nProbably the biggest victim in this movie is journalism itself. In a handful of not-so-subtle scenes, director Tom McCarthy hints that the kind of journalism Spotlight does is no longer a fundamental part of journalism today. The Boston Church scandal was the first national news story to break and be covered widely after 9/11 and in the film it feels like a final triumph before investigative reporting packs up and slinks away; replaced by sensationalism and political vitriol. There are still outfits like Spotlight who work silently and make big waves when the time comes yet as paper media dies a slow death, these teams are asked to do twice as much with three times less. We have more means of communication than we ever had in history, yet the sources for the kind of system changing, disruptive information we crave or lacking that need, have become sparse. Here's to hoping change is made soon."

For two hours journalists and reporters go door to door in the homes of victims, listening to stories along the lines of, \"I was 12 years old, and a priest in our parish molested me for a box of chocolates...\" You know, maybe I'm callous, but stories like this don't surprise me at all. Yes, it's a shameful phenomenon. It's not good. But somehow it doesn't surprise me, and that's it. It's hard for me to imagine anyone watching \"Spotlight\" for two hours and gasping with indignation every time.\n\nDo you know why? Because you can't push your emotions all the time throughout the whole picture.\n\nYou have to \"let go\" of the viewer sometimes. Let him relax. Have some fun. There's nothing like that in this film.\n\nThe acting is disgusting. I have no sympathy for any of the characters.\n\nNo, maybe they are all good actors, but where is the leader?

The drama here comes from the detail, and the reporters' slow realisation that their investigation could change the world far beyond Boston's city limits. The Church's power is revealed as smoke, mirrors and an unwarranted sense of deference, with journalism at its best proving its worth.\n\nDirector Thomas McCarthy's great strength is in his refusal to pander to audiences, or to default to easy answers; the correct reaction to the team's work is horror rather than jubilation. And while admirable, the reporters take some blame upon themselves. This crisis, after all, developed under their noses and it took an outsider to force them to examine it. Similarly, the cast (Mark Ruffalo was freakin' good!) modestly play down their characters' achievements and reputations. There is no Oscar-bait grandstanding (well, maybe one moment) and they all look quietly dowdy without indulging in any unnecessary uglification. These journalist greats could happily have rubbed shoulders with Woodward and Bernstein in All The President's Men, and they bring down an even bigger institution.\n\nTalky and intelligent, this lacks the glib edge of Aaron Sorkin or the poppy zip of Tarantino.

Instead, its tone is led by its characters, moving from scepticism to revelation and the uncomfortable sense that we should all feel guilty for ignoring the secrets too hard to acknowledge."

        "review_detailed_main": "I grew up fully aware of priests praying on children, which is probably why I've always seen priests as human beings not gods. They are men who are priests, like other men are writers, teachers, or scientists. But I was still dumbfounded by Spotlight. The scale of it might be small, if you take into account that Boston is just one city, but the size of what was going is impressive. So many people, boys and girls, our cousins, brothers, or aunts were molested as kids and paid off for their trouble. Left to live with a burden and a secret that could eat them alive. Like they've made a point of doing in the movie it's a systemic thing. They protect their own and actually have the guts to cover crimes if that keeps their image clean.\n\nSix years ago, I met two priests who I knew full well were having sex - with adults obviously - and it didn't phase me one bit. I even kept their secrets, heck I'm still keeping their secret. So I'm asking myself if I'd be capable of keeping it secret if I knew of a priest or anyone molesting children? I'd like to think I would never but the truth is I don't know. I haven't been put in that situation. I'm talking about this because in the film they didn't vilify the people who knew but kept it a secret. It could have been easy to tear down those lawyers, cops, and parents who kept their mouth shut. Spotlight basically shows how the church and everyone involved let down, the victims and protecting, while not making an argument against religion. It's a movie about people and their actions, not an anti-religion piece.\n\nSpotlight is a great example of what investigative journalism is. The story and the journalists' work is present in a clear and understandable way, it's a lot of information but nothing is dumb down. You're engaged in the investigation, in the work that goes into it, and on the effects it has on the characters. The performances are on point, as good as the script is, you easily believe the authenticity of each character. You see them as real people. A couple of performances stands out, mainly Mark Ruffalo's because his character has some great moments. He seems to be the most affected by their investigation, whereas the other characters look more impartial in contrast.\n\nLike I've tweeted before, Spotlight is the best 2hours I've spent in a theater in the last 6months.\n\nBy @garcwrites"

The story is interesting, well acted, engaging and original. I agree with the comments on the lack of development of the characters in the story.\n\nOne of this film's shortcomings as I see it however, is the lack of any mention of scandals in the catholic church on the same subject. How is it that the reporters do not refer even once to similar large-scale stories, for example in Ireland, Canada or other countries? By the time the Boston Globe reporters researched this story, nation-wide cases similar to this one had already come to light. The thing that disappoints me in this story, is the American based chauvinism that is trying to tell its viewers that Boston Globe was the first independent group of journalists that ever researched anything like this. This is strongly supported by the credits at the end of the film.\n\nOverall an appealing, documentary-like story with little character development, 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yet another true story film that does it right and adds itself to the already busy catalog of movies doing the same thing this year, probably making it to the top of the list. One of those rare films that simply doesn't miss a beat.\n\nIt is incredible how director Tom McCarthy manages to make every single scene bring us further into the story and characters. This is one of the best screenplays of recent years directed masterfully. This is a film about subtext, about trusting the audience and making them think and follow for themselves. Almost at no point there is some pause or some big monologue that spoon feeds us what is going on, what we should be thinking or what the film is about. Right from the opening scene, which hooked me terrifically, you understand how intelligent the movie is and how alive it is. Nothing is said explicitly, nothing is thrown at you, all of the characters are giving space to develop and live, which ultimately results in both us having a stronger connection to them and to the overall story. We get why it is so important for them and since it is important for them it becomes important for us, that is basic filmaking yet it is hard to nail and this is a full representation of it. Thrilling from the first to the last frame.\n\nIt is also marvelous to see a film put together with such technical perfection. The cinematography other than being gorgeous immensely helps in telling the story and not getting us lost thanks to fantastic visual sound. The editing is constantly brilliant and surprising. Howard Shore's music is pitch perfect for the film and the sound is so alive and flowing it contributes immensely into elevating the slew of great performances we have. What a cast ensemble. Everybody on A+ game, Ruffalo being a very good highlight, yet for me, Tucci in the first place rises above all other, but even more so: Liev Schreiber is stunning. As soon as he appeared on screen I knew something special was going on and he did not disappoint, his work is acting greatness.\n\nLet me just make a digression on my grading system. I use a grading system out of 10 with half votes. Whilst I strongly believe that what ultimately matters is the review and the personal experience, I find that grades really help in giving the overall feel of what the movie did for me, they are my personal stance on each film. Generally when I enter 9 or higher territory, it's always because I thought the film was a masterpiece or almost. 8.5 instead is for great movies that just miss the mark by a hair. Really often I find that I can't immediately put focus on why many 8.5 film don't get the 9 treatment because I am so overwhelmed by how good they are, I never easily find the flaw, but I feel in me it's just missing that mark for something. And as it always happens that something isn't really anything that the film can be blamed for, it isn't a flaw per say, it's just that element that I feel is what is keeping the film from being the freaking best. This is the case of \"Spotlight\", I have realized what is that element that I admit would have been very hard to integrate and could have easily interrupted the beautiful flow the movie has, yet it's the element that if handled well, I believe, could have made the film as harrowing and riveting as it could possibly be. Enough digression, that element is the representation of the church. Now I am nor Christian nor catholic, it is not why I am saying this, the reason I say it is because the church is never given a light side in the film. Maybe the filmmakers thought that the psychologist-priest was that, but he isn't even ever on screen and talks twice. I am not in anyway denying how corrupt and terrible the church can be, on the contrary I am the first to say that, yet in the landscape of the film, giving the church also a light side, which undeniably exists no matter how big or small it is, that's what could have given the film a huge, even bigger, moral value. The discussion would have been raised a notch and it would have been an even more touching and reflective film, if that is possible. On a side note, I do have two nitpick problems: Mark Ruffalo has two scenes that are a little out of place in the film and feel forced, fortunately they are very brief, secondly the film does use end titles and whilst they didn't bother me as usual I still think they don't work 99% of times because they just kill the thirst of knowledge that well done true story films can instill in you and it is also a very cheap emotional punch.\n\nOn a further rewatch, which I hope to do very, very soon, I might change my idea and elevate this film even further. But that's not saying much since it is already one of the best films of the year and one of the delights a film fan can ask for."

The Mark Ruffalo outburst. I remember clearly at the Cinema literally grabbing the arms of the chair as I felt the character's emotion and angst. Hell, I laugh and cry and many movies but that scene, this creation, stirs emotions I have never felt watching a movie.\n\nThe movie is pretty much faultless. What a story, what a movie.

By experiencing it from the viewpoint of the media, it becomes even more apparent the lengths to which some senior members of the church went to avoid publicity - as well as the influence religion still has on modern-day society.\n\nStrong casting helps to emphasise the story: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams (among others) all portray their characters brilliantly, hailing them as the heroes that uncovered the priest scandal of the early 2000s. Spotlight is not an easy watch, but navigates a difficult plot well by giving a glimpse of justice; however, even after watching, you will be left with an uneasy feeling that is hard to shake."

We shouldn't bury them and look the other way. It is wrong as heck. This is the main message of this film.\n\nThis docudrama film is about an investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Catholic priests. It has a correct tone about the incidents which is rare for an American film. Its screenplay is very well-written and promising. It could just have a stronger stand against religion, which is the main reason that such horrible acts are happening throughout the world.\n\nTom McCarthy did a great job as a director, only if he could set the tone a bit more balanced and a bit lighter, it could have been better. Some sequences were too legal and kind of too much stuck in the office. I can understand the point but it made the film as a very good film and not a perfect film.\n\nMasanobu Takayanagi did a subtle cinematography here which was good. Howard Shore's work on this film was minimal but good and to the point.\n\nWe had an ensemble cast here and they were all great. Especially Mark Ruffalo.\n\nSome meticulous edits were done by Tom McArdle which added to the story and the mood.\n\nLet's be clear. All religions are poison. Most people who read the so-called holy books and preach them are at the best some lunatics or na\u00efve people. A lot of religious people are taking advantage of us in varies forms and shapes. It is not just sexual abuse. But this film delved into this issue in a professional way.\n\nThis film is a professional work of art from top to the bottom.\n\nCatholic church, Vatican and religious leaders must be stopped. We, as the people must stop supporting them for good.\n\nThese child sexual abuse cases are a few examples that religion and religious people have nothing to do with being ethical.\n\nThis film is one of the best examples that proves the power of journalism and not being silent.\n\n8/10."

Now the best journalism movie since Alan J. Pakula classic is coming to theatres; hoping the film will give a similar boost to journalists and their profession. This film is a disturbing movie, but in all the good ways. This happened, people dealt with it, they brought the story to light and this is why they were doing so good. The truly dramatic story here lies offscreen and goes a great degree in the past, while the journalists work consisted mostly of persistence, constant grinding and not having a life until the job is done - and maybe not even then. This film is most of all a reminder of the kind of investigate print journalism, which is becoming even more rarer. This material can't help but be interesting, even compelling.\n\nAs numerous notable films have demonstrated, the spectacle of lowly scribes bringing down the great and powerful can make for exciting, more than interesting cinema. However, there's none of the paranoia of a picture like (mentioned before) Alan J. Pakula's 1976 film or Michael Mann's The Insider (1999). Spotlight has a few inevitable journo clich\u00e9s where male reporters are dishevelled, don't need to keep the same hours as everyone else, machismo on the subjects of poker and sports and they somehow never need to do the boring grind of sitting down and writing on computers. Though, this movie is honourably concerned to avoid sensationalism and the bad taste involved in implying that journalists, and not the child abuse survivors, are the really important people here. Plus, what is interesting about this film is that it reminds you that the theory of child abuse by priests was widely accepted until relatively recently.\n\nOn the one hand, there's no real depth given to these reporters. Unfortunately, characters are not interesting or distinctive enough, even the uniformly excellent actors playing them can't bring them to life all by themselves. On the other hand, the movie doesn't make them look like heroes as well, but more like what they truly are: reporters, doing their job in order to highlight a true story. In fact, Michael Keaton is terrific here again after Birdman. Throughout the film, as this case built and built to the point where you are just amazed this is a true story displayed in front of you; actors performed and hold back so well that as you watch it you almost don't feel like you're watching a film anymore but a documentary. Despite having actors that are so recognisable, they truly disappear into their characters and when you can say that of a film, they win. What McCarthy is saying in this movie is that threats never need to be made. A word here, a drink there, a frown and a look on the golf course or at the charity ball, this was all that was needed to enforce a silence surrounding a transgression that most of the community could hardly believe existed anyway. Finally, there is something cautious about the film dramatic pace and as McCarthy keeps the narrative motor running, there are some very good scenes. Chiefly the extraordinary moment when Sacha Pfeiffer starring Rachel McAdams confronts a retired priest ans asks him, flat out, if he has ever molested a child. The resulting scene had me on the edge of my seat.\n\nOverall, this well intentioned journalism drama capably tells an important story. It blew me away, it's a remarkably well written and acted film."

We get a repetitive cycle of a reporter talking to this source, then another reporter talking to another source, and so on. From time to time we get bigger insights about the emotional impact of abuse on the victims, the heavy role of the Catholic Church in this society and how the lawyers always know more than they let on, but overall I felt this film was too much of a straight retelling of facts."

We gotta show people that nobody can get away with this; Not a priest, or a cardinal or a freaking pope!\"\n\nGood investigative journalism is a dying medium in today's world where most media outlets are in a rush to get the exclusive and tell the story first. The same could be said for the film industry, but there are always exceptions because for every dozens of films like Alvin and the Chipmunks, we get a Spotlight. Director, Tom McCarthy, takes his time to tell this brilliant true story through a tight script that slowly begins to uncover the truth behind one of the Catholic Church's greatest cover-ups. It is a reminder of how important good journalism can be in today's world. Hopefully after watching Spotlight more people will begin reading their news from trusty newspapers instead of simply reading headlines from any internet article. It was refreshing to see a film like this portraying what good journalism is all about without taking any shortcuts. As a communication major the subject matter really appealed to me and I felt very emotional during a couple of scenes. McCarthy did a fantastic job at going through the every day ordeal of investigating. If you notice there is barely any reference towards these characters backgrounds or their family life. The entire film focuses entirely on their profession and that is what makes this such a powerful film because it avoids any kind of manipulation into character development. I loved the attention to detail that McCarthy brought to the film and how he decided to exclusively build it all around the investigation.\n\nBringing the true events of an investigation concerning the child molestation cover-up by the Catholic Church to life in a film might not seem like an interesting subject matter, but McCarthy handles the material with grace. He manages to slowly build the tension by going through the everyday ordeals of serious journalism. Spotlight is the name given to the investigative section of the Globe comprised of four reporters that take their time to research an important issue and build a compelling story. In this case they discover a link between several child molestation incidents with some priests from the Boston area and how the Church has repeatedly covered up for them by simply relocating them to other areas. These four reporters are given the gigantic task of trying to unmask this secretly huge system of defense built by the Catholic Church. The film accomplishes what it sets out to do from the first frame and it delivers one of the best films about investigative journalism in years.\n\nThis is a team effort, there are no lead performances in this film. Michael Keaton might be the leader of the Spotlight team, but Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and Brian d'Arcy James all deliver strong performances. Ruffalo has received much of the acclaim because he has some of the more emotional moments on screen, and that verbal standoff off with Keaton is powerful, but everyone on screen delivers solid performances. Liev Schreiber is also outstanding as the new editor in chief who arrives at the Globe and comes up with the idea for the story. And Stanley Tucci of course is always mesmerizing any time he's on screen. Spotlight has probably my favorite ensemble cast of the year. I was a huge fan of this film and of course comparisons with All The President's Men are justified."

        "review_title": "\"All the Archbishop's Men\"... or 6% of them...",
        "review_detailed_main": "Tom McCarthy's \"Spotlight\" is one of these movies that are either loved or hated for the wrong reasons. Wherever your faith stands, it is not a charge against the Roman Catholic Church, but members of the Archdiocese who covered up ongoing child molestations and protected incriminated priests. The film's goal is less to make people question their faith on God, than on the men in charge of their faith. Ultimately, the Church's greatest enemy becomes the Church itself.\n\nAnd the film's brilliant screenplay erases all the controversy in one single line and I salute Tom McCarthy, the director of Catholic background, and co-writer with Josh singer, to have very intelligently made his point through one simple exchange. Reporter Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) is talking to one of the victims, and the man says he still considers himself a Catholic. How so? Mike asks. It's simple, the Catholic Church is an Institution, made by men, and men pass by while faith is eternal. Mike, a Catholic like many members of the 'Spotlight' unit, doesn't get it, but at least the point is made: the priests who commit these crimes were criminal and the whole investigation aims the accomplices, which leas to another masterstroke of writing: the portrayal of the 'villain'.\n\nWait, what villain? Did I miss something? Was there a bad guy in the film? Not outside the script as McCarthy deliberately avoided depicting the incriminated Cardinal Law as a physical presence in the film, in order to avoid the presence of a polarizing villain. And sometimes, the invisibility of the 'bad guy' makes his influence even more fearsome, especially when, as the investigations progresses, the journalists understand it's not just about the Church, it's a whole system that is involved. And you can feel it from the directing, Boston, the Catholic city, the birthplace of the Kennedys, the setting of \"The Verdict\" another thrilling courtroom drama with religious figures in cause, this Boston is a great city, but it feels rather small and confined in \"Spotlight\", as to convey a sense of paranoid entrapment, you know like \"what happens in Boston, stays in Boston\".\n\nAnd this is exactly how the sexual abuses spread widely and became a pattern that would forever soil the image of the Church. No one took the responsibility, no one faced the facts, no lawyers had the guts to appeal to court and no journalist dared to dig deeper in the case, including the Globe, it was all settled privately. Everyone is responsible, and this is why the film's impartiality isn't to be challenged, they're all part of the same hypocrisy and like Mitchell Garabedian, Stanley Tucci as the lawyer who wrote a column accusing Cardinal Law of covering up a priest, \"it takes a city to raise a child, it takes a city to abuse one\". And I guess this is why it will take an outsider to start all over again. It's not too late after all, to make up lost time.\n\nMarty Barone (Liev Schreiber) is the new editor of the Globe, and sees the Garabedian's column as the tree that hides the forest. He asks the 'Spotlight' investigate unit, lead by 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton) to investigate. Thanks to Rezendes' tenacity, Geberian blows the whistle and give other names, and the snowball effect leads to a series of convocations, door-knocks, interviews with the victims, lawyers who were in charge of the case, and from a few priests, it turns to 6% of the Archdiocese being involved. And like its glorious predecessor, \"All the President's Men\", \"Spotlight\" makes a thriller out of a relatively safe mission without threatening phone calls, death threats, gunshots or chases in dark parking lots.\n\nBut if the journalists' lives are not at stakes, the harm is already done for the victims' lives, forever ruined as it wasn't just \"physical, but psychological\" abuse, so what the investigation does is a quest for justice and for shining (literally) the spotlight on the people who let some awful crimes to be and let be done. \"What's your responsibility to publish this?\" Mike is asked by a judge, his answer is perfect: \"what's our responsibility not to publish it\". It's a matter of ethics, and as the white knights, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams make an interesting Redford-Hoffman-like pair with Keaton as 'Jason Robards', encouraging the team to go further, or slow down for tactical reasons. Tlming matters as well and it's for these little subtleties, that the screenplay is a winner.\n\n\"Spotlight\" is one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies, and the Best Picture front-runner, earning a nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Ruffalo was the pounding heart of the film) and for directing and screenplay. Speaking of the screenplay, there's an abundance of name-dropping in the film and that can get pretty confusing, (there's even a moment where they kept referring to Law, and I didn't know it was the name of a Cardinal). But these considerations are trivial because it was the same with \"All the President's Men\" and it wasn't much an issue, as the film is most about the procedural than the details, the big scope: how this team of five journalists will make the light of truth shine. And McCarthy's sober directing, respectful to our intelligence, doesn't overdo the cheers, the last shot alone is emotionally rewarding.\n\nFor playing in the safe side and for its own good, \"Spotlight\" turns out to be one of the best movies of 2015, and shouldn't be judged for its attack against the Church, but for its fight for the truth, for justice and for the dignity of the victims who were too scared to translate their pain into words. Indeed, it's hard enough to talk about 'sexuality' and religion in public statements, imagine in the same sentence. And it's reassuring that the film was also well-received by the Church which, in a way, is coming to terms with its own demons."

        "review_detailed_main": "The single most remarkable thing about this film is how it uses a confined scope to its advantage rather than otherwise, something that would only be possible in a docudrama of this sort. The makers of \"Spotlight\" were obviously seeking to avoid cheap sensationalism. There is no use of flashback, and the interviews with the now-adult victims are brief yet detailed enough to make their point. There is little showing of the pedophiliac priests, and the public outcry that followed the first exposures of the scandal in Boston and throughout the world is effectively limited to the after-notes. Yet, it as if you are the proverbial fly on the wall of the \"Boston Globe\" and flying along with their reporters on the street. While a film of this sort will never have huge mass appeal--which may in itself be several strikes in its favor--it's two-plus well-worth-it hours for anyone with a serious interest in the whole explosive affair within the Roman Catholic church. I was utterly entranced.\n\nThe details and complications are hard to completely follow on first view, and the sheer number of characters makes it difficult to place who's-who in some cases. That doesn't, however, conflict too much with the big picture. \"Spotlight\" is also quite revealing of the dilemmas and politics that take place within a newspaper office and its dealings with local VIPs.\n\nMuch of the success of \"Spotlight\" is, of course, due to the fine, fine quality of the acting and script. Special kudos to Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and all the actors who play the various victims. The subtle development of \"characters\" such as the cantankerous but obsessively dedicated and conscientious attorney Mitchell Garabedian (similarly well-played by Stanley Tucci) is also commendable."

At first hearing it may not seem much like a movie that would be of wide interest. A bunch of investigative journalists uncovering a story of widespread child molestation by the clergy in Boston. Yup, sounds interesting conceptually but perhaps too serious a subject matter for an afternoon's entertainment?\n\nActually, try it out. The team of journalists at the Boston Globe, all have fleshed out characters, look vibrant and engaged in what they are doing, and act well as an ensemble. No one big dominating hero here. It's the team in focus.\n\nRemember All the Presidents Men? That 1976 Redford, Hoffman movie about the uncovering of the Watergate scandal by The Washington Post?

Doing so allows McCarthy to let the story take hold on the viewer and the enormity of the situation wash over us as we realise just what was being uncovered by these reporters, and without ever playing up situations for easy emotional pay offs, McCarthy delivers hits without an air of melodrama or cinematic tricks, no doubt aware that the material speaks for itself.\n\nSaying that the story is the star player here would however take away from a finely tuned ensemble that's led by another great Michael Keaton performance and both a reminder of Mark Ruffalo's talents and Rachel McAdam's ability when given the right substances to work with, although her Oscar nomination feels somewhat strange. Each actor brings a subtle nuance to their incarnations and they act as another telling example of McCarthy's (an actor himself) ability to not only direct and write, but draw out excellent performances from his cast's.\n\nSpotlight is an astutely crafted investigation procedural that never strays to far from what you'd expect from such a tale but with a winning script and a likable cast of performers it's a high quality production that could've benefited ever so slightly from a larger focus towards the cinematic.\n\nIn light of this however, Spotlight is a quietly powerful and sometimes devastating look at a topic that continues to be played out daily in far too many cities around the world.\n\n4 foreboding church buildings out of 5"

So he assigns the Globe's \"spotlight\" team to the story \u2013 a close-knit group of journalists who uncover the biggest scandals in Boston. Michael Keaton leads the team consisting of Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and a few others as they delve into one of the most important journalism investigations of our time.\n\nThe execution of Spotlight is what really made it the best picture winner at the Oscars. The way it delves into the journalistic process \u2013 the countless interviews, the research, piecing things together with scant evidence until you get the smoking gun \u2013 that's what keeps you watching this movie. A journalism investigation is not exactly something you think would hold your attention for two hours, but it does. It is also a very tightly edited film \u2013 each scene moves the story forward and not a moment is wasted or excessive.\n\nWhat I especially admire about Spotlight is its low key feel and humble nature. It celebrates the value of investigative reporting while acknowledging that journalists really dropped the ball by not pursuing this story sooner. It gives this serious issue the importance it deserves while asking the question \u2013 why did it take people, particularly journalists, so long to act? All of the pieces were there for them to put together. Could they have done something sooner? And it does all this with very few manipulative, Oscar baity moments. It lets the story stand for itself.\n\nSpotlight is a triumph of good story telling with little flash or style, and there's nothing wrong with that."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film, directed and written by Tom McCarthy and co-written by Josh Singer, follows an engrossing retelling of the Boston Globe and their attempt to expose a massive scandal in 2001 that shocked the entire nation as well as the Catholic Church to its core. With a powerful screenplay and direction, this film based on true events, deals with newly hired news editor Marty Baron of the Boston Globe (played by Liev Schreiber) who assembles a team of journalists to uncover the massive child molestation scandal by committed priests of Catholic Churches that has run rampant throughout the nation, and to matters worse, has been kept a secret for many decades. This team includes Michael Rezendez (played by Mark Ruffalo), Sasha Pfeiffer (played by Rachel McAdams), Matt Carroll (played by Brian D'Arcy James), Ben Bradlee Jr. (played by John Slattery), and their leader Walter Robinson (played by Michael Keaton). This movie dramatizes the team's investigation into these child sex abuse cases occurring and their attempt to shine their light on them to the public.\n\nThis film touches a very heavy subject as far as the plot goes, and Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer bring powerful appeal to the horrifying story this film revolves around. Telling the story in a fact-based manner, this film grips audiences into a dark and dramatic story, hitting the major key points of the events that were going on at the time; and doesn't attempt to over dramatize nor sugarcoat the events that made both national and international headlines. It is doesn't portray the story in a sense of heroism. What comes of this is a story that operates on a honest, solid level as well as an authentic inside look of what goes on behind the newsroom. McCarthy and Singer bless with this film with such incredible writing, and the story moves at an even pace. The entire story behind the Boston Globe as well as the stories dealing with the child abuse cases are both intriguing, yet deeply affecting. The emotional intensity is conveyed not just by the story or the actors' performances, but the thoughts it leaves viewers with of how people were going to Church to hear these priests preach the gospel but were unaware of the harrowing activity going on behind the stage. There is plenty of emotional and heart-tapping scenes throughout the picture, most of which take place when the characters are interviewing the various victims and discussing in explicit detail of their experiences, but nonetheless strengthens the interest in the story for viewers, whether they are familiar with the events or not.\n\nMark Ruffalo really hits home with his performance, by far his most powerful performance he has given in his career. Rachel McAdams and Michael Keaton are also very creditable here too. McAdams who gave diligence to her role in sports drama 'Southpaw' earlier in the year, and Michael Keaton who impressed audiences and critics everywhere in last year's Oscar winning picture 'Birdman', are both very natural in their roles and are definitely Oscar-worthy for their performances. The rest of the cast including Stanley Tucci and Billy Cruddup who play the attorneys also deserve a round of applause for their acting here.\n\nSpotlight is one of the best films of 2015, and something to definitely watch for during this year's Academy Awards ceremony. Many films based on true events do not come as superb and interesting as this one. It is deeply engrossing and gripping from the start, and utterly thought- provoking that it will likely lead to serious discussions after viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie \"Spotlight,\" was a film about a massive sexual child abuse perpetrated by hundreds of priests of the Catholic Church. The main character of the film was Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, and Brian d'Arcy James. They go on a journey of finding out the horrible truth about the priests of the Catholic Church.\n\nSpotlight was a group of four journalists named Mike, Walter, Sacha, and Matt. The four of them worked together to investigate, gather information, and were able to get their hands on sensitive records that were sealed to the public. As Spotlight continue to investigate, they come to find out that the Catholic Church were making settlements with the victims of sexual abuse to keep them from ever saying anything to the public. They then found out that a log was kept with the name of all the priests, and each time a priest committed sexual abuse it was written in the log with the excuse that they were absent due to illness. This was a simple act of covering up. At the end Mike was able to get a hold of the public record which reveal all the cases and hundred of priests involved. The law officials have known about these cases for many years and did nothing to stop it from ever happing again.\n\nThere were a few film techniques used in this film to bring out the story of these priests. I felt like the film focused more on the information rather than the characters. One of the techniques that I recognize in the film \"Spotlight,\" was the camera movement. In one of the scenes, Matt finds out that one of the accused priest lives close by. The camera follows him from behind as he runs up to the house where the priest lived and then slowly zooms up to Matt face. The scene was intense because it should how Matt was shocked but at the same time also wanting to protect his kids from the priest. Another example of a film technique used is the lighting of the film. I felt like throughout the film the lighting was neutral and, in a way, it almost felt like a documentary. I think the filmmaker wanted its audience to focus more on the details provided rather than the quality of the film.\n\nOne film that is similar to \"Spotlight\" is \"Citizen Kane.\" These two films are similar because they are about journalists going about finding out the truth of the matter. In both films, the authors focused more on the information that was found by the journalist and what it revealed and the facts before publishing it to the public.\n\nIn conclusion, I enjoy watching \"Spotlight.\" It was an eye-opening to know what was going on and how many families were affected by this all. The director of \"Spotlight\" did a great job of telling the story and the truth about it. This film was a story that many of the Catholic Church didn't think will ever come out and the filmmaker did a great job at putting its focuses on revealing the truth."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a journalism story set primarily in 2001-2002 Boston. It follows the Boston Globe investigation into child sexual abuse by Catholic priests and the history of the Catholic Church in hushing up the stories.\n\nThe film opens with a flashback to a 1976 case of child sexual abuse by a Boston priest, with the church quietly covering it up. We then learn the priest was still active in 2001.\n\nThe movie then shifts to a new managing editor of the Boston Globe, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), a non-local Jew in an Irish Catholic city still greatly influenced by the Catholic Church. The Globe has occasionally covered priest abuse stories but has not expanded coverage because of Church and political resistance. The assistant managing editor was Ben Bradlee, Jr. (John Slattery).\n\nHowever, the Globe has a small investigative journalism unit known as \"Spotlight.\" It's led by Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton). The other reporters are Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James).\n\nThe story follows the efforts of the Spotlight crew to identify perpetrators and victims, often slowed by missing or legally suppressed documents and lawyers hiding behind confidentiality agreements that protect the Church. They also need to increasingly trust the startling claims by victim organizations like SNAP, led by Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), and victim lawyers like Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci).\n\nThis is an excellent film on par with \"All the President's Men.\" The self-doubt before launching the investigation, the slow process of getting the story, and even the realization of missed opportunities to investigate the story eight years earlier. For me, Michael Keaton and Liev Schreiber are best in their roles. Mark Ruffalo plays the hard-charging Carl Bernstein type. It was good to see Rachel McAdams play the role of a key female reporter with a level of empathy the male actors probably couldn't have achieved."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tom McCarthy's look at the Boston Globe investigation that exposed sexual abuse committed by priests hits all the right notes. As with \"All the President's Men\", even though we know the outcome it's still a riveting story. Part of the point that \"Spotlight\" makes is that the widespread cover-up of pedophilia in the Catholic Church required the complicity of all parties (you may have heard that evil succeeds when good people do nothing). The reporters who started looking into the story had no idea just how big it was going to be.\n\nThe movie's Best Picture win was well deserved. Not only does it look at this specific story, but it reminds the audience of the importance of investigative journalism. Investigative journalism is one of the main tools of holding the powerful accountable. The people at the Boston Globe knew that it was a risk to take on one of the world's largest and most powerful entities, but also knew that it was the right thing to do.\n\nMichael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James, and the rest of the cast put in fine performances. The characters refuse to waver in their determination to expose the truth. The fact that, following the publication, so many more people came forth and talked about having gotten molested shows how much power the church had over people (especially since the pedophile priests simply got moved to other parishes and did the same thing all over again).\n\nAnother movie focusing on pedophilia in the church is John Patrick Shanley's \"Doubt\" starring Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams."

Very much unlike *The Big Short*, for example, another of this year's feature-length films recounting a recent true story, there are no really innovative new approaches to movie making here.\n\nBut that is not to say that this movie holds no interest. Not at all. Unlike any of the classic newspaper movies I know, this one gets complicated when you start to suspect that there are people in the paper itself who are working against the journalists covering the big story.\n\nYou also start to wonder what involvement the journalists in question themselves may have had with similar situations, since they are all Boston Catholics themselves. Lots of old-fashioned close-ups of their faces, faces that are expressing anguished thoughts not put into words, leave you wondering. This is not like covering the Watergate break-in, you come to realize. These reporters are in fact discovering things about themselves, their upbringing, their community, as they probe ever more leads into cases of child abuse by Boston Catholic priests.\n\nThere is nothing innovative about the film making here, perhaps. But the script is written for intelligent adults, and demands your full attention, which it amply rewards.\n\nThis is not an easy movie to watch, frankly, because you end up viewing the case through the anguish of the reporters. In that sense, it takes the ability to see all this as new and horrifying, despite all we have learned since.\n\nBut it is very much a movie that is worth the effort, and the discomfort, to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is self-evident that SPOTLIGHT is a tailor-made Oscar-bait in every aspect, chronicles the sensational and gasping 2003 Pulitzer Prize-winning reportage by the Boston Globe's Spotlight team, to disclose the rampant pedophiliac activity among the Roman Catholic church in Boston, a more shocking revelation is the fact that the entire church system has been unscrupulously cover these clergymen over decades, transfers them from parish to parish, and nips any opposition in the buds. The film is a strenuously faithful re-enactment of the story, directed and co-written by Tom McCarthy as the fifth time he sits in the director chair after a quite consistently outstanding resum\u00e9 (THE STATION AGENT 2003, THE VISTOR 2007, WIN WIN 2011), on the ground that we could all pretend that the horrendous Adam Sandler vehicle THE COBBLER (2014) had never happened.\n\nIt is remarkable that McCarthy adopts a completely down-to-earth approach to present the narrative, encourages his sterling ensemble cast to strike a personal contact with their real-life characters and maximumly imitates their personalities to the silver screen, no melodramatic frills are allowed to manipulate audience's reactions and simply lets the truth speaks for itself, and trust me, it is more than enough to make the point.\n\nThe whole investigation is conducted at the behest of the newly-appointed editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), whose Jewish origin could be appropriated as an easy target for his motivation, but his keen perception and pensive temperament determine that there is nothing to hold him back until they hold the whole corrupt system accountable for the sin. Schreiber's resilient, withdrawn acting option works like magic.\n\nThe Spotlight team quartet is headed by Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (Keaton), with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams) and Matt Carroll (James), the investigative process is formulaic and daunting, indefatigably following the leads until one gets what he wants, or better, a new discovery. Meanwhile, McCarthy is extremely parsimonious to shed any light on his characters' personal lives, as if he is making a point that journalists barely have anything else apart from their work, in hindsight, it is probably the safest way to avoid any lawsuit due to poetic licence, since most of the characters are still alive-and-kicking, no level-headed individual wants his or her own private hurdles being exposed for exploitation. On the other hand, McCarthy and co-writer Josh Singer is level-headed enough to not over-hype their activities either (since it is obvious that vested interest is always a collateral byproduct in the journalism against their altruistic motivation), thus, no individual heroism pops out stridently, and what we see, is a conscientious teamwork steadily dredges up scandalous evidences, and a understated minor twist reveals a lamentable remiss which could have changed the status quo decades earlier.\n\nRuffalo, bags his third Oscar-nomination amongst all the male cast, while McAdams is the lucky gal honoured with a coattail nomination being the only woman in the ensemble. That is not to say that their performances are inferior, on the contrary, everyone is well-deserved for their ensemble win in the SAG, since their interpretation is closely complying with their respective character, and it happens to be, those journalists don't possess the larger-than-life persona, the only time, a remotely over-the-top moment belongs to Ruffalo's Michael, that's why he is the pick by the academy, but Keaton, Schreiber, Tucci, even Crudup portray their roles in a more accomplished flair, plus, in my book, Ruffalo should be shifted to a borderline leading role (he has the most screen time and his contribution to the project is most minutely detailed), to save some space for his co-stars.\n\nUnarguably, SPOTLIGHT is an important film expos\u00e9 depicting a rotten underbelly of our society and what we should heed is its aftermath, since the Boston discovery is merely a tip of the iceberg, if one can lucidly imagine the whole ugly picture, it is not difficult to picture the colossal disillusion it inflicts on religious devotees who has a conscience, whom we deem as the pillar of a healthy society and perhaps, something positive could happen from within, for that reason alone, SPOTLIGHT should win BEST PICTURE this year, not that Oscar really matters these days, it is just a do-the-right-thing testimony for the sake of its own reputation."

        "review_detailed_main": "At one point in my life I was seriously considering becoming a journalist, hoping to write hard-hitting stories that would break down walls and change lives. There is something so captivating and singular about the job - sniffing out good news and not letting it go until it becomes public information. That love for the printed page remains strong with me through the years. Coincidentally, I am teaching journalism in a school now and I am loving it. Teaching it and watching this latest journalistic procedural are the closest I will ever get to it.\n\nThe spotlight is on Spotlight, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States and its investigation into the widespread child sex abuse cases in the Boston area. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Boston Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The investigative unit uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.\n\nThere is a moment when John Slattery exclaimed \"90 fcuking priests!\" I suspect the f-word is used in equal weightage as a verb, an adjective and as a spontaneous intensifier of shock, horror, or anger. This is a story that is so insanely criminal that it has to be told but how it is told is the bright spot.\n\nThe ensemble acting is pitch-perfect. The talent on hand is amazing. No one one-ups another in any scene and I didn't get the feeling these are accomplished actors doing a job. They look and feel like real journalists. Armed with a keen and focused mind, a trusty pen and a notepad, the close-knit group of four reporters \"gegenpress\" all the way to the ugly truth. For slightly more than two solid hours we are treated to a showcase of some incredible work ethics - setting aside every stick of hay in the stack till they get to the needle. There isn't a need to preach about the sacrifices they have made but we know it intrinsically when we see Mark Ruffalo boiling two sausages for dinner or Liev Schreiber leaving the office when the sky is pitch black. There is something so intoxicating about watching professionals born on earth to do one job and to do it exceptionally well. I was riveted. The acting is nuanced and restrained with no fanfare and a jolly pat on the back for a job well done. What a breath of fresh air.\n\nGoing after a systemic expose of the Catholic Archdiocese, director Tom McCarthy never paints the priests as villains the size of mountains. But there wasn't any doubt in my mind they are monsters, spiritually lost monsters. There was never any need to preach a 3-point sermon but yet the message hits my raw nerve. This is extremely assured filmmaking which gives us the respect we crave for and seldom see in movies.\n\nThe film may be a talkie but it has the rhythm and pacing of an intelligent thriller. The dialogue cuts right down to the bone and I am surprised there is no fluff and zero fats lined the bone. Every scene serves an important purpose and if you take anyone of them out I have a feeling the movie will lose its momentum.\n\nSpotlight is a tour de force and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men (1996) as one of the best journalistic procedurals ever. Every element of the film is flawless and the sum of all its parts gave me a tingling feeling underneath my skin. Surely this has Best Picture written all over it (I have yet to see The Revenant and Brooklyn though).\n\nPS - I had a hoot seeing Liev Schreiber here and can't help feeling this movie works like a sorta revenge sequel in an alternate universe to Ray Donovan in which his character was abused by a priest."

It's happened to better movies in the past. This film peels scabs off some very nasty psychological injuries that we as society may not want to revisit, but need to, very much so. History repeats itself until the lessons are learned.\n\nI am very appreciative of the reality that there is an interrelatedness and consideration that happens the matter of the gravity of the story when larger more global affairs do transpire. How often are very important events lost behind even larger events?\n\nI was impressed by the depiction that integrity does exist in some arenas still to this day and there are people who are more than willing to accept responsibility for the error of their past judgments or dismissal of less than savory possibilities.\n\nThis is a solid film about real people, with real issues that need to be at the forefront of how we govern ourselves. This whole season of Oscar contenders and SAG award nominees are field of reminders to the general public that films can tell great stories of facts as well as fantasy\u0085 And often times the fantasies are not as horrifying nor as fantastic as fact.\n\nThank you for phenomenal, simple storytelling, thank you for reminding us that the cinema can be a powerful instrument beyond being a vehicle to sell shiny, undigestable popcorn and Scooby snacks.\n\nThank you for bringing back post credit dialogue between viewers.\n\nWatch this film and talk about it afterward... a lot."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are times when God can be used by people who ought to know better to justify doing horrible things to others. The sex abuse scandal inside the Catholic church, which may very well have been going on for decades under the table, was one of those things; and it was exposed perhaps for the first time in one of the most heavily Catholic cities in the world, namely Boston. And it was reporters from the Boston Globe who, undeterred by threats, both implied and overt, conducted a year-long investigation into the pattern of pedophilia and the subsequent cover-up of it by religious and government figures in their city and made it public, causing a worldwide firestorm that in many ways damaged the Catholic church irreparably. That is the story told in director Tom McCarthy's brilliant film SPOTLIGHT.\n\nSPOTLIGHT takes its name from that special investigations division of the Boston Globe that tended to uncover the less savory aspects of Boston's higher places of power; and it was that division uncovered the Boston sex abuse scandal. Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Mark Ruffalo portray the three real-life reporters who, bit by bit, gather all the facts about this story, one that Boston's Catholic archdiocese knew about for decades but had successfully buried for an equally long time. What they find out, in ways and through situations that have fairly modest but nevertheless noticeable parallels to the Watergate scandal depicted in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, is that the pattern of priest abuse wasn't just limited to \"a few bad apples\", but which involved at least ninety of the Boston archdiocese's 1500 priests, and hundreds, if indeed not thousands, of young children dating as far back as the early 1960s. At the end, once their story hits the front pages of the Globe, which happened just a week or so into 2002, thousands of victims come forth with their own horror stories of encounters with Catholic priests having done decidedly unholy things to them as kids and getting away with it. What had been a local story, and more importantly one that had been kept under wraps forever, would now explode with financially and spiritually catastrophic results for the Catholic Church.\n\nThere are no \"big scenes\", in the strictest conventional Hollywood sense, here in SPOTLIGHT; indeed, much of the story unfolds so methodically. Moreover, none of the three principals outshines the others, which gives the film a decidedly ensemble feel with Keaton, Ruffalo, and McAdams. Liev Schreiber and John Slattery portray the real-life editors at the Globe who urged a press-forward until the paper got a story that was solid and would stand up to any kind of scrutiny. But besides being a great film about an important and still timely issue in American life, SPOTLIGHT is also something of a tragedy, in that these kids continued to bear the scars as adults; and in a faith where God is everything, and priests are looked upon almost as Jesus Himself, those scars and the betrayal that came from them are permanent and damaging.\n\nThe final victory for SPOTLIGHT is showing what a huge difference free and independent media in America, one beholden only to the news and the truth and not corporate and financial dictates, can make when it does its job. McCarthy and his cast should be roundly and loudly applauded for this film."

Spotlight is a very minimalistic film; dialogue driven, subtly directed and almost documentary style. Most of the film is just people talking, but it's a ruthlessly absorbing film more thrilling than many thrillers and more horrifying than most horror films. Although it's very low key, it's a strong, hard-hitting and deeply powerful tale, brought to life with excellent acting and Tom McCarthy's superbly stripped down direction. Spotlight is not just a movie. It's life. It's a real event, populated with human characters which doesn't resort to manipulation, pyrotechnics, emotional breakdowns or a load of shouting. A very worthy, engrossing and fittingly affecting drama, this actually lives up to the Oscar hype for once. It's probably too low key to win Best Picture, but I'd have no complaints if it did.\n\n9/10"

I am not a Catholic, I really am not a massively religious person at all but no matter who you are this story is important and affecting, it boggles my mind that you can watch this and still have any form of respect for the Catholic Church. This is really the modern day, \"All the President's Men\", it follows \"Spotlight\", a journalistic team that researches the molestation charges against the Catholic Church before unveiling just how deep the problem goes. Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are really the two main characters and both do great but I really liked Brian d'Arcy James, he was probably the member of the main cast who got the least screen time but I really liked him. I think that technically this film is well made and that it's a really important film for people to watch, especially if they're catholic. An easy 8/10 that could go up to a 9 on a second viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story begins when a new editor, who isn't Boston Catholic, joins the Boston Globe and suggests looking deeper into one case of child rape. Indeed he is reading up the Red Sox, which is perhaps the second religious organisation in Boston. The culture is not to question authority figures - not the Church, not the lawyers who colluded, not judges who helped suppress information, not the police who didn't resist and the journalists hesitate to make enemies. The intimidation is sinister because these men have been confident in their seat of power.\n\n'Spotlight' is the title of a 4 person team of investigative reporters in the Globe and perhaps beyond the basic story, the movie underlines the importance of the Fourth Estate. If all reporting was based on Twitter or Instagram, important news that people want under the carpet will never see the light of day. This kind of reporting is expensive but is a social good we NEED.\n\nOnce the team began to really investigate, the scale of the problem was slowly revealed. 6% of priests abuse children. People who knew (nurses, physicians, police etc) kept their families safe but it was the children of innocent parents, who couldn't imagine depravity, who suffered. The story looks at the pathology and the system the church employed.\n\nThese characters are not fleshed out, partly because there are 6+ while we felt we knew Woodsein and Ben Bradley after 'All the Presidents Men'. The story also addresses how the journalists might rebuild relationships with friends, family, their church, their confidence as professionals, having missed the story for so long. Stanley Tucci has perhaps the best lines 'The Church thinks in centuries' and that's right. In Ireland the even argued they were in the right, based on Cannon Law !!!\n\nRichard O'Rourke has a small but significant role as a shockingly, disturbed and creepy priest. Great casting! He takes his few lines and turns them into gold, demonstrating the horror, without actual graphics.\n\nThis movie is not a thriller - there are no meetings in garages, no fear that the CIA or FBI would take them out (although there is a concern about other papers getting a scoop). The church didn't need to resort to those excesses. They knew the threats to reputations and financial security carried weight.\n\nThe Catholic Church has establishments all over the world and what happened in Boston was one of hundreds of stories. 'Mea Culpa' is the documentary that looks deeper into the Vatican. Nobody is fooled - these priests are now in Haiti and other countries where children are vulnerable."

        "review_detailed_main": "It doesn't seem right to review this film. It actually feels like some sort of moral infringement. This is because I feel like \"Spotlight\" is one of the most important non-documentary films ever made. This story had to be told and Nicole Rocklin and Blye Faust (the film's producers) couldn't have hired a better cast to tell it. Given that I was looking for film-editing that flowed together more smoothly and cinematography that was darker and more shadowy to represent the shadiness of the Catholic Church at the time. But I can easily overlook all of this films flaws because of how intense this story is. Not to mention how well all of the lead actors fit their parts. My favorite performance has to be Mark Ruffulo's. His character is so awkward and twitchy is a very subtle sense that is pretty hard to get down for any less of an actor. It didn't seem that any of the other actors had to really try to nail any impressions or anything like that. The worst thing that they could have done really is overact and that didn't happen. As a result of how most of these characters being pretty much just average, every day type people, there weren't really any performances that were really Oscar-worthy to me but again the story that this movie tells just overshadows so many flaws for me and just turns this film into an eye-opening masterpiece. I love this film's tone. It doesn't really try to glorify anyone. It doesn't try to make anyone look like a hero. It just tells the truth about what happened, which is everyone was just doing their jobs. As a result, the Catholic church was allowed to get away with a lot of sexual molestation of minors. But, ironically, it also prompted their downfall. If the journalists of the Spotlight team portrayed hadn't done their jobs correctly, who knows how long it would have taken for all of this to unfold. 'Spotlight' does not sugar- coat or over dramatize. It is a film encapsulated by realistic dialog and an attempt to tell this a true event exactly as it happen. It is in no way a film that has some sort of deep social commentary against organized religion. It doesn't try to encourage the audience to deviate from the Catholic fate or tell them what to believe. It is just a film about exposing the deepest and darkest side of supposedly one of the most holy and morally just institutions in the world."

The stunning list of scandal localities at the end of the movie demonstrates just how vast this odious practice spread.\n\nKUDOS to ALL the actors. I do not agree with the previous critic who said that Rachel McAdams had nothing to do in the movie. She provided the quiet center and ballast to the proceedings. Two hours went by and I could have stayed for another two hours. I did think it was odd that in a theater seating 207, I was the only one at the showing."

        "review_title": "A fine tribute to ethical journalism and its power to do good.",
        "review_detailed_main": "This film is a David and Goliath style investigative drama wherein brave journalism exposes evil, which in this case is the systemic corruption found in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston in the early 2000s. While stories about child abuse are not designed for entertainment, this one is a highly engaging thriller about the Boston Globe's specialist team called Spotlight that challenged one of the most powerful institutions on earth. Its linear plot-line unfolds gradually to let you share the discovery of the tip of a corruption iceberg that kept getting bigger and bigger.\n\nThe story itself is now global knowledge and countries around the world are still coming to terms with child abuse scandals that will take generations to remediate, forgive, and forget. Spotlight uses the cinematic device of dramatic understatement to give viewers the emotional space in which to confront the enormity of the facts as they become known. This understatement includes a slow narrative, a crisp factual script with little melodrama, actor authenticity with none of the five investigators stealing any limelight, and muted de-saturated colours to convey the rat-hole nature of investigative journalism. Its a small group of tenacious foot-sloggers in an old-fashioned hunt for truth, but they bring down the house of god armed with just facts and faith.\n\nThe larger moral tale beyond the film points to a primal human weakness seen repeatedly on a grand scale throughout the history of mankind: shamefully knowing but not acting. The passing mention of \"good Germans\" is one hint of this bigger message. When the evidence piles up about offending priests, corrupt senior clergy, official cover ups, victim pay offs, hidden or re-assigned offenders who were free to re-offend, it becomes clear that entire communities turned a blind eye to what was happening. The church, schools, local government, and perhaps saddest of all, parents, chose silence to protect their faith. When good people ignore evil, everyone is morally culpable. This film tells the story without dramatics and with respect for victims needing a voice. The revelations of Spotlight led to 600 cases being exposed and triggered hundreds of similar investigations that continue around the world. This film is a fine tribute to ethical journalism and its power to do good."

        "review_title": "Docudrama of The Boston Globe's The Boston Globe's Investigation of Catholic Church's Clergy pedophile scandal and the cover-up.",
        "review_detailed_main": "if you want to understand the process by which four investigative reporters - each with his/her own expertise - function as a team working for the \"Spotlight\" unit of The Boston Globe's newspaper in 2001, exposing what will become a Pulitzer Prize (2003) winning probe of the Catholic Church's furtive silence and the Boston Archdiocese's cover up of pedophile priests who molested guileless young boys and girls in their Massachusetts' parishes, see the movie SPOTLIGHT, a docudrama written and directed by Tom McCarthy. A film that is not histrionic in its presentation, but slowly and methodically builds a case which unearths the horrific breach of trust between \"believers\" and those who are anointed as their spiritual sentinels in the secular world. The aftermath of the newspaper's disclosures reverberated beyond its local sphere of examination into an international autopsy exhuming shame and dishonor upon the Church and its leaders.\n\nSPOTLIGHT opens with a feeling of tension; we sense the apprehension of a close-knit circle of reporters - the Spotlight investigative division of The Boston Globe - a small corps of journalists who focus on one important story oftentimes for over a year - when an \"outsider\", Marty Baron (a self-possessed, beautifully understated performance by Liev Schreiber) is recruited from The Miami Herald to become their new Editor. Baron realizes the potential of Spotlight to substantially examine an issue and shifts their target unto a story that over the years had been buried deep into the paper, occasionally surfacing to be interred again - eruptions of accusations appearing in print expeditiously extinguished. Marty Baron understands the need to look at the Institution itself - not just pinpointing individual perpetrators and victims, but examining the Catholic Church and its powerful influence on other authoritative organizations in predominantly Irish Catholic Boston, well aware that there will be attempts to stifle any exploration that cuts deeper into the skin of corruption.\n\nThe meticulous and disciplined search for the \"truth\" of a story involves interviewing victims now in adulthood, who reveal lacerating facts on their loss of innocence at the hands of the very people they trusted most to protect them - a spiritual shock as well as a physical one. Sacha Pfeiffer (a non-glamorous Rachel McAdams who is turning into a wonderful actor) conducts many of the painful interviews excavating devastating memories - her empathy and concern are both convincing and authoritative. One weeps for the hidden secrets that are divulged and the overwhelming feeling of powerlessness that these young people must covertly endure.\n\nMichael Keaton, who stars as Walter \"Robby\" Robinson, communicates through expressive facial nuance, and the hunch of his shoulders, the conflicted burden and courage that being leader of the Globe's coverage exacts on his innate view of himself - an Irish Catholic member of the church; a man who rubbed shoulders with the Cardinal and other politically connected elite Church officials; a person who despite the distressing revelation that while he was Editor of the Metro Section years before - the glimmerings of this scandal were literally kicked underground into files gathering dust in the storage bins of the newspaper.\n\nMark Ruffalo, another terrific actor is frenetic as Mike Rezendes - a Spotlight columnist who is in constant motion, a whirlwind of physical movement - ascetic in his dedication to spending long hours following leads, questioning defense attorneys, ferreting out important documents, petitioning court papers, and at the same time imbued with an equally impassioned integrity in lifting the lid on this pressure cooker of deceit. I responded to his innate decency and inexorable belief in the need for Spotlight to yield a scalpel of precision in cleansing the fetid decades old duplicity of the Church.\n\nThe fourth participant of Spotlight is the numbers man, Matt Carroll, (Brian d'Arcy James,) an individual who makes sense of the mounds of accumulated data, once the stick has pierced the hornet's nest. Carroll intuitively makes necessary connections and has the tough \"unglamorous\" job of putting fact to \"fiction.\"\n\nSPOTLIGHT has an ensemble cast ie: Ben Bradlee Jr. (played by John Slattery of Mad Men fame), son of Ben Bradlee of The Washington Post Watergate scandal fame) supervises the Spotlight team; Stanley Tucci excellent as Mitchell Garabedian who is portrayed as a querulous, cantankerous attorney whose firm to date has represented more than 1000 victims and survivors of clergy abuse. In 2001 Garabedian played a pivotal part in The Boston Globe's explosive revelations.\n\nWhat sets SPOTLIGHT apart from other movies that dramatize political \"cover-ups\" is the directness and restrained tone of its presentation. There are no \"deep throats\", midnight trysts lurking in the background, but rather a deliberate, efficient system of operation which slowly yields results that withstand legal scrutiny - conclusions backed by strong research that will detonate Institutional complicity and dissimulation - echoing around the globe generating further investigations like a chain of illuminations in a tunnel of obfuscation, lighting up the shrouds of darkness."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am genuinely pleased that Spotlight took this year's Oscar for best picture. It is an important film and given the Royal Commission currently underway to address abuse cases originating from Australia, a topical one that really should be seen.\n\nWithout spoilers, I can safely state that this film is actually quite accessible and not as difficult to watch as I had previously anticipated. Whilst Spotlight addresses horrific crimes against children, I did not consider it to be in any way gratuitous or exploitative. It has a docu-drama feel about it which makes it somewhat cold and impersonal.\n\nIt must be noted that Spotlight is a true story about the investigative process led by three committed journalists, their editor (brilliantly played by Michael Keaton), the socially awkward editor in chief also wonderfully downplayed by the always dependable Liev Schrieber, and their relationship with members of the legal fraternity.\n\nIt is however less concerned about the abuse victims' stories and is largely focused on the team's interest in exposing the magnitude of the systemic abuse by the Catholic Church. Which as we are now all witnessing from watching the news, reverberates all the way to the Vatican. Make no mistake, in certain scenes, this film will make your blood boil. And this is to me Spotlight's fundamental weakness in that it really only manages to scratch the surface of the horrors for which the church is squarely responsible. And only just manages to do so."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the most interesting films I have seen in recent times. The script is based on real facts, namely the journalistic investigation that publicized the scandal of child abuse in the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, USA. However, the film goes further and establishes a link between these investigation and similar scandals that have happened in other countries.\n\nI am a historian, but I am also an employee of the Catholic Church. I am not a priest, but I work with many priests, and I have some friends in the priesthood. So, I have a vision of the interior of the Church that most people don't have. And the Church, in spite of being universal, is also fragile and has an increasing fear of what can be said about her. It is understandable: the strength of the Church resides in people who go to Mass, make offerings, help with charitable works and collaborate. And, despite the weight the Church still has, it has been questioned in traditionally Catholic regions such as the Mediterranean, Latin America and USA. There are fewer baptisms and marriages, the social weight of the clergy is secondary, there are fewer candidates for the priesthood and the number of practitioners has decreased. The Church is strong and powerful, but it is increasingly isolated and discredited. This is a concern for the Catholics and the fear of public opinion explains why the Church tries to solve problems with minimal waves.\n\nThe issue of celibacy is addressed as one of the causes of child abuse. I do not believe that. It is true that priests were never exemplary in chastity, but it is also true that this has been a rule imposed on the clergy for over a thousand years. The Church does not expel priests who \"fall into temptation\", but invites them to think about what they want and demands that they assume their responsibilities with consistency and honesty. As for child abuse... there is no justification. Evil can be forgiven, never justified. Justifying child abuse with celibacy implies thinking that this will end if the priests get married. But there are a lot of married men who also abuse children. The truth is simple: there are people who have wrong or criminal instincts and inclinations, some of them have sought refuge in the Church. But child abuse will continue to exist with or without a celibate clergy.\n\nThe film has an excellent cast where I would highlight, for the quality of the work done, the names of Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAddams and Liev Schreiber, which brought the investigative journalists of Spotlight magazine to the Boston Globe. Another actor I liked to see here was Stanley Tucci, in the role of a lawyer who worked with the accused priests.\n\nThe film took very good advantage of the original material and the real facts on which it is based, and creates a wonderful story by the way it follows the efforts of journalists to discover more and more about the abuse of minors and the position of the local cardinal. The pace, which is deliberately slow, allows it to build gradually without losing the thread of the story. The absence of great effects, a showy cinematography or an overly incisive soundtrack allows us to focus on the story and the work of the cast. And that was a conscious and intelligent option of the production, which knew how to have at hand what was necessary to build an excellent film, dispensing with the stylistic artifices and giving almost a documentary note to a film that is largely fictional."

        "review_detailed_main": "Surpassing all my expectations 'Spotlight' is a genre of film making largely left behind for the air-headed action blockbuster. A genre overlooked at the expense of storytelling with the highest degree of integrity. I was pleased I didn't know more than the basics before heading to the Cinema and surprised to learn I had just watched a 130min film that moved at such a smart pace it seemed more like 90mins. Looking back over the list of award winning talent involved, coupled with the extended care they took with editing explained why. While not always agreeing with the glitzy awards process this is one of the few times I felt they got it right.\n\nThe balance of voice over, and music under montages was flawless. Howard Shore's inspired score was special, managing to be melodic and actionful all at once. During one sequence, Shore propels a bed of rapidly edited investigative research images with an intense underscore, at the same time leaving me wanting to revisit the sound track just to enjoy the musicality.\n\nIt's not all that common to be treated like thinking adults by modern commercial movie makers and it leaves this audience member wanting more. The whole exercise had the look and feel everyone involved wanted to leave a little part of themselves (for all the best reasons!) etched in motion picture history. Director Tom Mc Carthy (remembered for his part in creating that great story \"Up\" in 2009) creates another winner. The sterling cast and crew are all deserving of their awards and nominations. It's also to be hoped this work may go towards convincing the perverted and sick to stay away from institutions whose sole purpose should be to serve as 'carers', not for gaining opportunistic access to the less fortunate. And perhaps if humanly possible, recognize and seek treatment for their afflictions, not inflict them on others.\n\nAll institutions must take responsibility for those they employ and how they conduct themselves to protect the vulnerable. The astonishing level of research details given within the end credits show a shocking pattern of actions taken by the Vatican 'city' in moving offenders out of prime positions throughout the world, into 'prime' positions within that very 'city' or otherwise.\n\nWhen an institution supposedly dedicated to the word of GOD begins making and serving its own laws, there's little hope it can any longer genuinely serve God or humanity. As for the law society and their part in these and other atrocities...there's an equal measure of shame. Even, as this brave film demonstrates, journalists themselves are not without guilt. Can we also dare to consider this work may possibly contribute towards lifting the level of support for 'quality' journalism in these days of superficial 'social' media!!?\n\nBravo all round (and a nod of recognition for that other great Boston establishment WGBH for their past years of similarly great documentaries that this movie reminded me of)\n\nNote to caring parents (if any still out there). Took a star off for patches of not always necessary crude dialog. KenR"

This is how great stories are told and more importantly this is how true stories are told. The movie is not easy to watch, not even for normal people but especially for children and adults who have gone through series of rapes and molestation by people they trust the most, people who are messengers of God. And the numbers are not small \u2013 the list of geographies and states the movie states at the end show you how deeply entrenched this problem is.\n\nThe movie does not try to sensationalize this subject, exactly how journalism is supposed to be conducted. It somehow reminded me of Zodiac (2007), a true story which became a great movie. The depth of the research and the portrayal of characters is simply outstanding. I have been reading about the making of this movie and its great that actors like Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are humble enough to get into their characters and learn from the actual people they are portraying. Just shows the discipline with which some movies are made. Liev Schreiber has a smaller role but he portrays the intensity of the real Marty Barton really solidly \u2013 Marty Barton must have had such clarity of thought to believe that it is the system that needs to be addressed, not the individual people who committed these crimes.\n\nIt also shows how faith comes crashing down, how painful it is to know that the people you think are the holiest are just as human as anybody else out there. It shows how frightened a society is, especially when it comes to uncovering something that everybody knows about but haven't done a thing about.\n\nIts these small, humanizing factors that makes Spotlight what it is. It is brilliantly directed, the editing is tight and the movie keeps you on edge while dealing with a very sensitive topic. Its got 6 Oscar nominations and I am definitely rooting for Mark Ruffalo. I like the way he can play this puppy-dog-romantic and also act with intensity that really makes you believe in that character."

        "review_title": "Sensitive intriguing approach to a sad story",
        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight is a sad and fascinating movie to watch. Sad because it deals with the systematic abuse of children by ministers of the Catholic Church. Unfortunately, this story is nothing that happened just in Boston long ago. Just a couple of weeks ago, an Australian royal commission revealed the same systemic abuse in Australian Catholic churches and boys schools, with higher levels of pedophilia, and similar polices of cover-up and/or disregard for some of the children's complaints. As one of the victims says in the film, \"we were not only raped physically, but also spiritually\".\n\nThe movie is really intriguing because the focus is mostly on the research carried about by the five people of the Spotlight section in the Boston Globe. This is not an anti-Catholic film at all, or a film against Catholics, but an expos\u00e9 on how the high spheres of the Catholic Church didn't get rid of the abusers and did nothing to protect and support the children and families abused, ignoring the most vulnerable among the community when they were most in need.\n\nI found the whole research process absolutely thrilling. I'm a historical researcher and I know how laborious and demanding research is, but also how rewarding and mind blowing it can be. I loved the fact that the film shows the impact that the investigation had on three of the journos involved, as they were raised Catholic.\n\nAll the actors do a great job and are convincing in their respective roles. I especially liked McAdams, Ruffalo, Crudrup and Tucci. However, this is a choral movie, and the chorus sings wonderfully in tune.\n\nThe cinematography and atmosphere are excellent, and the music is absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe main downside of Spotlight is that the research story becomes a bit flat at moments. A bit of more narrative digging would have lifted up the tone of the movie. 1/ I would have liked more victims' voices being included in the film, and also the details mentioned in the letter of a mother to Cardinal Law being brought out more prominently into the story. 2/ I would have liked having a few of the abusers profiled; we are just hinted the case of Ronald Paquin. 3/ I would have liked to dig into why \"Tempo\" decided not to follow lawyer Mcleish's letter fifteen years before, and why nothing was done when a victims association provided the newspaper with tons of material, way before Baron took the newspaper over; was it lack of interest? He didn't believe the claim? There were more pressing editorial matters? Why specifically such a horrendous case was just ignored for fifteen years or so?\n\nOverall, Spotlight is a very good movie, with very good performances, great atmosphere, and very balanced in the way it approaches such a delicate and horrible subject."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight takes on the story of the Catholic Church's cover up of pedophile priests in Boston in 2001. A new editor, Marty Baron(Liev Schreiber), hears of what looks at first to be a small news item of a priest molesting a young boy, and decides to have the Boston Globe's Spotlight team dig deeper to see if there is a bigger story to be uncovered. Robby Robinson(Michael Keaton) leads the team of journalists in the investigation which uncovers the now well known scandal of Cardinal Law and other leaders of the church ignoring the exploding criminal activities of a shockingly large number of priests being protected and moved from parish to parish. Spotlight focuses mainly on the dogged pursuit by the hard working reporters who keep on despite the atmosphere of intimidation of the Archdiocese of Boston. Director Tom McCarthy keeps the film moving and has an excellent cast led by Michael Keaton, who is ably supported by Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo as fellow Globe reporters. One of the best movies of 2015."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the finest movie of 2015, The Spotlight is an engrossing movie which unfolds the true story of how the Boston Globe newspaper uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.\n\nIt is one of the best investigative drama that I've seen. The script is the backbone of this movie. The sole focus of unearthing the wrong-doings at the local Boston Church does not deviate a bit from the plot and the scope of the movie. It keeps the audience absorbed and engaged. It's a very outstanding and an authentic movie where the audience feel connected all the time.\n\nFollowing the scandal in US in early 2002, various such incidents and stories were reported from all over the world. For their shocking reporting, The Globe won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.\n\nIt is a superbly controlled and engrossing movie which keeps the audience captivated with the true story and more than that the reality of the occurrences of the chain of events. It is an honest and compelling movie accentuated by the sheer acting performance of the ensemble cast. Mark Ruffalo's performance deserves a special mention. One of his best till date. Micheal Keaton and Rachel McAdams deliver amazing performances too. No over the top costumes or romantic sub-plots or any unwanted action scenes. The director Tom McCarthy should be credited for a great work. The Screenplay too deserve a special mention.\n\nNominated for 6 Oscars this year, this movie brings to the audience a true story worth knowing. A great work of newspaper reporting. Journalism at its best. \"They broke the story, they broke the silence.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie isn't really a movie I usually would want to watch but the Oscar buzz had me watching it. And wow it is very good, it hit me on an emotional level and my jaw dropped some times.\n\nIt's about a team of journalists and all of them are very good actors. It is very logical that Ruffalo and McAdams got their nominations because they're among the best actors in movies this year. However Keaton, Schreiber, Slattery, Tucci and others are also great. Just for the performances alone it's worth the watch.\n\nThe way they handled the source material is also very well done I think and it's a very compelling and moving story. I knew bits of the story but after this movie I felt bad for everything that happened. Some reveals in the movie had me dropping my jaw or even say \"Oh My God\" just because it was unbelievable. The movie is very well directed and edited to become one of the year's best.\n\nThe only reason you may not like it is because it's a movie with a lot of talk and not much actions. It's very much dialog driven so if you don't like that, you may not enjoy the movie. Even though the actors make the dialogs very interesting and compelling but that is what I think.\n\nAnyway, that is without spoiling what I thought of it. I give it a 9/10 because it was really good and definitely worth watching."

        "review_title": "All reporters investigate - that's the nature of the job",
        "review_detailed_main": "There is a strong connection between \"lie\" and \"death\". That is not only because a lie leads to the death of truth, but because it may also lead to the death of a human in both mental and physical sense. In such cases exposing a liar gets of high importance as it becomes equal to the rescue. And a striking story of such a rescue is covered in the film \"Spotlight\".\n\nThe plot of \"Spotlight\" follows one of the most upsetting topics - institutional efforts to cover up the crimes. The whole story revolves around a small The Boston Globe team of investigative journalists which gets assigned to report on sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. The Spotlight team does its best to get to the bottom of the Boston Archdiocese's decades-long cover-up. The aim is to expose Cardinal and reveal a horrifying truth.\n\nThe story and the film itself are emphasized by a brilliant cast including Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci. Although the personalities of their characters are not deeply shaped to maintain the focus on the plot, all the actors, to my mind, showed a great performance. Every supporting cast is strictly embedded, which is undoubtedly merit of the director Tom McCarthy.\n\nBeing based on actual events the film seems to truly capture the power of investigative journalism. Unlike broadcast journalism, it doesn't focus on news that already exist and goes beyond the mere reporting of the day-to-day events. The aim of reporting journalism is to go in-depth to cover a single story, which often takes months if not years. The thing is, the road to the truth is not smooth, so one needs to make substantial effort to overcome a great amount of obstacles. That gets trickier when the obstacles are placed by the Church. However, as we can see, nothing is impossible. \"Spotlight\" proves that and makes a strong point about the critical press and the importance which it has for society.\n\n\"Spotlight\" is not one of those films that you will forget about in a day. The film intelligently and deliberately depicts a horrifying true story and a real investigation. It is not an easy watch, but, no doubt, \"Spotlight\" really deserves all of the accolades it has received."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Spotlight' co-written by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer and directed by McCarthy is based on a real life story where The Boston Globe's Spotlight team of investigative journalists made investigations into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Catholic priests.\n\nThe acting and style of direction of the film go hand in hand and complement each other. McCarthy gets the most understated, nuanced and restrained performances from each and every one of the members of his amazing cast. Every actor cranks the subtlety up to 11 which along with McCarthy and Singer's naturalistic dialogue makes the characters as realistic as possible. All the actors work together and put the story above their own personal moments to shine on screen. The teamwork of the characters in the film gets beautifully portrayed by the actors. Ruffalo, Keaton, McAdams, Schreiber, Slattery, Tucci, etc. all are at the top of their game.\n\nThe style of direction, just like the acting is very unflashy. Just like the other McCarthy films that I have watched like 'The Station Agent' and 'Win Win', he gives the story and the characters all the importance without feeling the need to be too stylistic with camera movement. He uses minimalism to maximum effect and respects the subject matter and its importance and expects the viewer to do the same without feeling the need to see exciting edge of the seat moments. Having said that there are subtle directorial decisions like slow zoom-outs or slightly extended shots that are sparingly used by him. The procedural nature of the film is very reminiscent of 'All the President's Men' and 'Zodiac', although it is no way near as dark in its style of storytelling as Zodiac even though the subject matter is equally disturbing.\n\nThe city of Boston also plays a big role in the film. Even though it is a big city, the fact that it still has a very cosy and local feel to it is underlined by McCarthy. The huge role that the church and the catholic church played/plays in the lives of the Boston dwellers also gets depicted. The timeline of 2001 also gets utilised well. We see the occurrence of 9/11 and the attention of the Boston Globe gets quickly shifted to that story and the persistence and dedication of the Spotlight team on the sex abuse story gets tested temporarily which felt very believable.\n\n'Spotlight' is at the basic level a tribute to the hard working and dedicated journalists who love their work and care about the subjects and the people that they write for. This film is an account of a time when internet was starting to expand its horizons and the print media's significance was starting to decline, but that decline had not completely taken place yet. This is a film about a group of investigative journalists who toiled hard without any assistance from the internet. They manually researched, read books and put in the hours to do what they thought needed to be done. 'Spotlight' is a nod of the hat to all of the those hard working journalists of yesteryears. They are heroic not because of the lines that they say in the film, they are heroic because of their work."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight tells a story of the reporters of the Boston Globe, where the 'Spotlight' team uncovered a huge, global scandal of child molestation within the local Catholic Church. Spotlight is at its foremost a story about humans, communicating the sides of victims, layers, priests, clerks and reporters, as well as the one of true determination, honor and persistence.\n\nSpotlight at its core is a great, detailed investigative reporting piece. It deeply analyzes the human against the bureaucratic and political aspects of being a reporter, righteously glorifying the seemingly boring parts of the profession, which in the end all play an integral role in the resolution.\n\nThe nature of the piece that is being investigated is so surreal and unbelievable that it adds an incredible aura of mystery and suspense into scenes that otherwise would have not stood out. The dialogues are sharp and smart. They show not just the reporting side, but carefully convey the human emotions of these reporters.\n\nTom McCarthy's style is very fitting to the picture he paints. He is very direct and honest with his shots, giving us many close ups of the characters, helping further analyze the emotions that they are going through. The cast made this kind of directing possible by perfectly blending in with the characters; no one in particular stood out because no one needed to. There is no single hero here.\n\nAt first glance Spotlight might seem like another story of underdogs against a blind, soulless, corrupted system, yet the involvement of the Church significantly changes how the story is perceived. It makes these terrible events seem so much more appalling and significant that even the most eventless scenes become incredibly tense and thought provoking.\n\nYet the point of Spotlight is not to glorify the underlying story or bring the guilty to justice. We get none of that. Spotlight is about showing the process of true, detailed reporting. The 'Catholic Church' story of 2001 was most likely picked due to it's relevance. In essence, this movie could have been about any story, and it still would have succeeded on all the notes that it had. This might make Spotlight one the best films about investigative reporting, the one that fully communicates the demanding, punishing and grueling aspects of the profession.\n\nAs such the conclusion of Spotlight is not a victory of the justice system, it is not even a human victory where the victims can finally rest assured. It is the victory of the Spotlight team as reporters, echoed by the storm of incoming calls from victims all across America - their piece has made a difference."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just watched this movie for the first time concerning a massive cover-up of pedophile priests by the Catholic Church in Boston. I liked the investigative team that went after the story, actors Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams. Ruffalo and McAdams showed the instincts and spunk of true reporters. Once they smelled a rat, they pursued the story relentlessly getting the facts needed to make public aware of the cover-up that kept pedophiles from answering for their crimes. Keaton was the boss who had to ensure the hard evidence was secured to give credibility to the story. Michael Keaton is compelling as the guy who grew up in Boston, attended Boston College and became one of the boys on the golf course hobnobbing with lawyers and journalists. But he knew things were not right in the way his hometown and its dominant religious body was dealing with a grave injustice that was wrecking the lives of many young people. We get the sense of life in Boston with its love of sports and homespun camaraderie, something of a foil to deflect crimes lurking on its own dark side. The new kid on the block, Liev Screiber, is the one who unleashes the hounds as he tries to break through the easygoing veneer of official Boston, particularly its clergy and its lawyers. He shows the uneasiness of a man who doesn't quite fit in but gives his team the support they need to get the story out. A fine movie with great acting from the above as well as Stanley Tucci, John Slattery and Jamie Sheridan. This is a movie that reminds people that institutions have to account for injustice and cover-ups aimed at protecting their sacred turf."

Nothing excessive, overdone, or overstated. Nothing understated or whitewashed, either. The two writers have a clear understanding of how Catholics view the clergy and why this scandal was devastating for so many of them. The movie illustrates the difference between the Catholic faith and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe acting is excellent. Not one weak performance.

It is true story and a very good damn... the director has guts to bring movie which is about priest.... many people from my country maybe won't realize how much guts you need to tell this story..this is like you are suing IMAM from our mosque because he is guilty.. in my eyes this is Mark Ruffalo's best acting... he came out from mambo jumbo style which I saw in avengers and now you see me.

        "review_detailed_main": "Under the editorship of Robbie (Michael Keaton), the Boston Globe runs a small investigative team called 'Spotlight' which, steered by the new boss (Liev Schreiber) investigates the possibility of widespread abuse of children by Catholic priests. As the team investigates, it becomes frightening clear how widespread the abuse is, evidenced in part by the growing pressure from the church and others to bury the story.\n\nRightly the winner of the best film Oscar, not because it shines a light on the appalling behaviour of Catholic priests and the church that covered things up, but because it makes for a riveting, well sold story with a great script and fine, largely understated performances. Whilst there is just one scene where Mark Ruffalo understandably loses his cool, the rest is quietly underplayed, which works well juxtapositioning the tale against such a controversial topic that so easily could have been sensationalised. Whilst everyone in this is terrific, I would perhaps single out Stanley Tucci as a lawyer continuing the fight against constant battles from the church and especially Schreiber who atypically plays the relaxed but passionate editor in chief. A great film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Warning: you won't see obscene illicit actions of priests in this film. The survivors of the child molestation won't tell you much of their experience as well. The thing is that \"Spotlight\" is not about how bad the Church is. The main focus of it - to show people the importance of investigative journalism and to confirm the fact that the truth always comes up.\n\n\"Spotlight\" is The Boston Globe's team of investigative journalists who are working on series of the child sex abuse cases by numerous Catholic priests. Being put in confrontation with the most powerful institution of the society they fight against its aspiration to hush up the deeds of the abusive priests who infringe on the innocence of children. At first the journalists struggled to find the information since everyone kept silent but then, bit by bit, they managed to convince interested parties to switch to their side and the silence was broken.\n\nEvery detail of the \"Spotlight\" is concentrated on the investigation process: it shows the ways of getting information by the team, its endless paper work and the ritual of making notes at every opportunity; all the failures and all the doors slammed in your face. Throughout the film, I felt like I was inside the whole process, I became a part of it.\n\nThe member of the Spotlight team Mike Rezendes who made the great effort to contribute to this investigation said: \"They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us.\" After these words something changes in you. When shifting the stories of the survivors to yourself you realize how the sexual abuse could possibly have changed your life. Then the question arise: What would I do to stop it?\n\nThe importance of the investigative journalism is not to be questioned. Journalists spill the secrets about which the government is silent, thus showing the public that the truth will always come up if there is someone to say it out loud."

        "review_detailed_main": "I felt goosebumps all over my skin when the credits began. \"Spotlight\" is a spectacular movie with an important message.\n\nLet me begin by saying that this movie perfectly illustrates why it is important to act and to not look away. People have to use their voices, express their opinions and inform other people if they want to make a change in society. In this case, a group of journalists from \"The Boston Globe\" called \"Spotlight\" try to solve the case of priests who raped children throughout decades and simultaneously start a war against the church.\n\nThe motion picture is well-shot. Although the movie is coined by its message, plot and dialogues, director Tom McCarthy still managed it to find opportunities to impress visually. There are some beautiful shots captured. Furthermore, the score (by Howard Shore) is simply spectacular. I'm currently listening to it while writing this. I feel joy, motivation and sadness at the same time. It is a world-class piece of music. As I said, the movie relies on its plot. The writing is simply great. There is a clear structure, we cut back and forth in scenes, the dialogues are superb and it is all well-paced thus one does not lose any interest in following the story. Acting-wise the movie does not disappoint. Everyone knows their role. The standouts are Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton in my opinion, although Rachel McAdams and Liev Schreiber did a terrific job as well. Moreover, the supporting cast (meaning little roles that only have less than 10 minutes of screen time) was phenomenal. Cheers to the casting director. By the way, I enjoyed how the life of a journalist was depicted. I was intrigued by how much effort many people put in these stories.\n\nTo sum it up, I highly recommend \"Spotlight\". It is an inspiring motion picture and delivers important values and tells a crucial story. Currently I rate it as a 8 of 10, because of minor reasons. But as far as I know myself, I'll probably give it a higher rating after reading the script and watching the movie for a second time."

        "review_detailed_main": "With so many movies about investigative journalism elevating their protagonists to near-godlike status, to the detriment of the film's credibility, \"Spotlight\" is a welcome relief. Focusing on the Boston Globe's investigation into pedophile priests' abuses and the shameful effort on the part of the Catholic Church's leadership - and a fair amount of the congregation - to avoid the problem rather than fix it, contributing to the life-shattering abuse of countless children.\n\nThe reporters and their bosses are portrayed as skilled, determined, and dogged, but still human, struggling with their own backgrounds and concerns about their sources. More surprisingly, the managing editors and senior reporters are NOT portrayed as spineless, risk-averse roadblocks so common in journalism movies. Instead, the clear villain is the leadership of the Catholic Church and the lawyers for clients that profited from settling cases ad nauseum for decades, contributing to the abuse.\n\nAs someone raised Catholic, this scandal didn't shake my faith in Catholicism but it certainly shook my faith in the institution. This movie is unsentimental, avoiding subplots that would have been needless distraction. In essence, this is a template for movies about investigative journalism.\n\nAlso, this is the movie that \"Kill the Messenger\" wanted to be but instead fell into the normal, drama-enhancing traps (stereotyping the reporter's editors, stretching the facts, making the reporter a martyr, etc)."

How refreshing is that. I admit, I made the huge mistake of seeing The Divergent: Allegiant, the day before, which was horrendously bad. So, I was so relieved to view a good film with an adult plot. It is an important story, and the film captures the suspense and the sense that these guys were onto something big. Michael Keaton is just getting better. This is perhaps the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, in some time. And he is a great actor. Rachel McAdams, and Live Schreiber were also great. As well as Stanley Tucci, John Slattery, and Billy Crudup. The exteriors in Boston were authentic, as well as the interiors at the newspaper. It reminded me of the days when newspapers were an important part of daily life. And that was not long ago.\n\nI highly recommend this film, as long as you are not a big fan of Transformers, and Fast 7. Wow. This is a relatively rare occasion Hollywood gets it right. Nice to see they are still interested in, and capable of making films for adults."

Spotlight was a special group of Boston Globe reporters tasked with taking on deep investigative stories that took a lot of effort. Boy did they hit the jackpot with the Catholic priest scandal.\n\nIn the early 2000's, it was discovered that, the greater Boston Diocese knowingly allowed pedophile priests to continue working, transferring them from one parish to another, and putting them in places for \"rehabilitation\", right in neighborhoods. This movie depicts the steps taken by the reporting team, led by Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, and Rachel McAdams, to get to the truth.\n\nLiev Schreiver also delivers as the new managing editor who comes in to direct Spotlight's work when he smells the story that no one else goes near. In Boston, the Catholic church is sacrosanct. But Schreiver is not from Boston, so he feels no compunction to handle this story any differently than any other story of corruption and abuse of power.\n\nBit by bit, the reporters, working with the lawyer played by Stanley Tucci, peel off the layers of the onion to discover the sordid, bitter truth. The trail of corruption leads to the highest levels of the church, sending shock waves still felt to this day.\n\nThis is a no-nonsense film that will stick with you long afterwards. You will feel disgusted and saddened by the horrible things done by people who supposedly represent God on Earth. I don't think any of the reporters knew what they were getting into, but at the end, they were all emotionally shaken to get the facts.\n\nExcellent acting by all, and wonderful, taut direction was rewarded with the Best Picture Academy award, and 6 Academy nominations.\n\nIf you want to see a gripping, moving, and emotional true story, go see Spotlight, which sheds light on the darkest parts of the shameful, hidden Catholic church's behavior."

The movie has a simple yet very strong storyline.Rachel Mcadams' performance was brilliant, she was very natural and so was keaton and ruffalo. In recent times we have been having movies which either are too much with the expense or special effects or cinematography or a complex plot which may be good but is not for everyone. Spotlight is what a normal person can define what good movies should be like.The story about the investigation journalism which finally uncovers big scandal of molestations also shows us what the life of news reporters is like.Soundtrack is good,gets along nicely with the theme of the film.Cinematography is okay too. Overall i would say it is a very good movie and i would love to more of this kind of films.Great work by Tom McCarthy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight 2015 2hr. 8 min.\n\nChildhood molestation and the Catholic Church has been a hot button issue since the early 2000's. With scandals of Priests molesting young children and the Cardinal's all around the world sweeping these issues under the rug by reassigning priests to other churches to wreak more havoc among other young children at other churches. Pope Francis visited America, this past fall and several survivors of molestation's have been very critical of the Catholic Church and wanted justice for the victims of this tragic failure of the church to take responsibility for various priests' actions by arresting and convicting these so called priests. In the city of Boston Massachusetts, a newspaper and 4 investigators that are called \"Spotlight\" decided to focus on the church scandal following the hiring of the Jewish editor Marty Baron (Liv Schreiber) of the newspaper called The Boston Globe. The head of the Spotlight team is a man called Walter Robinson (well played by Michael Keaton) who leads the charge of getting to the bottom of these allegations and another spotlight investigator, Mike Renzende ( Mark Ruffalo) attempts to talk to the leading attorney, who represented some thirty victims of the scandals. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) who wants justice even though the settlement sum for the victims is very low. Garabedian, professes to Renzende that he tells his clients that what they are doing coming forward, was the right thing to do. There is the defense attorney, who represents the church, who tells Robinson that the Boston Globe had this case 5 years earlier, but choose not to follow up. The other two reporters Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carrol (Brian d'Arcy James) attempt to track down various Priests and victims and to hear their stories. One person who talks to Pfeiffer is a gay man, who kept his secret for years, because the Priest said performing sexual acts on him was a good thing. The priest also says to the victim that he should approves of same sex love, and the victim struggles with shame and guilt over his own internal feelings of trusting a man of faith. Another startling scene, is when Pfeiffer talks to a Priest, who freely admits to molesting young boys and defends his actions because he confesses that he was molested as a child. The conversation ends when the former priest sister come in and abruptly ending the interview. There is a scene when Renzende wants to publish the story of at least 30 victims of the abuse with Robinson contending that the case is so much bigger than they spotlight gang can handle. Rendenze wants to investigate more victims and the Catholic Church. The two people get into a shouting match and both characters make legitimate points and the resolution of their conflict is convincing and leads to a conclusion that is just and accurate in its depiction of investigative journalism. The performances are first rate especially by Ruffalo, who is a lapsed Catholic, who was considering rejoining the Catholic church until the he begins to investigate the story. John Slattery, is also good who is the commander in chief of the Boston Globe and Keaton is supreme as the man who doesn't realize until the end that the story could have been investigated sooner than he realizes. The film reminds me of the great 1976 film \"All the President Men\" about two writers from the Washington Post Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward (played by actors Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford) covering Watergate and investigating Nixon crimes while he was in office. A character named Deep throat exposes Nixon corruption and irresponsibility that leads to his downfall. The two films have one great thing in common, they are about justice and seeking truth among the people who hold a high regard for. These two films are about truth, justice and how we need to call out the deceit and betrayal that our leaders where albeit a clergyman, to the President of the United States. We as citizens of the world need to call out hypocrisy in society and to hold those responsible accountable for their illicit actions."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Spotlight\" is the story of reporters from The Boston Globe who uncovered the Catholic priest sexual abuse scandal in the early 2000s. The story moves at a brisk pace as the layers of abuse and coverup are peeled back through more and more investigative journalism. We get a good look into journalism and the business of newspapers as well, with our main reporters fending off attacks and threats from rival newspapers, the church, and lawyers. I really like how we are shown the nitty-gritty of how news sources get their information.\n\nMark Ruffalo is probably the standout to me in this film. He does a really good job as Michael Rezendes, a real life journalist who helped break the story. The movie's pacing is just something I can't get over, it's really phenomenal the sense of urgency and how against the clock the characters feel to make sure that these stories are told with the proper light that they need, in order to prevent further burial from the church.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the movie is not explicitly anti-Catholic or anything like that. It shows us the dark and unexposed secrets that the church leadership had successfully covered up for decades. In fact, although I am not a Catholic myself, I think members of that faith should feel all the more inclined to see this movie.\n\n\"Spotlight\" is a great one, and I think that it tells us a story that definitely needs to be heard again and again, and never forgotten."

Everyone who saw it must admit this is one of the most sensitive theme around for a few years.\n\nIn my opinion, this was the best acting by Mark Ruffalo so far, his accent, his moves, his speech, everything was top notch. Big credits goes to Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams and last but not least Liev Shreiber who wasn't on screen that much, however he still made a huge impact on whole story in many ways - he was like a shark, silent killer.\n\nI can't express enough how important this movie is, how it can change the look on those who were abused, how it can and hopefully will change the life of those who were molested, their families, friends...

        "review_detailed_main": "How far would you go to uncover the dark secrets of the world's largest institute? The Roman Catholic Church a place where people go to find peace and comfort is now tainted with allegations of priest's molesting and raping young boys and girls. In this captivating drama that is based on true events it is up to a team of news reporters to uncover the truth behind it all. I really enjoyed this movie even though going into it I had no idea what it was going to be about. The way \"Spotlight\" is set up is incredibly done and it leaves you feeling dumbstruck because you would have never guessed the outrages actions people did to cover this scandal up.\n\nLike I said I had no idea what the plot of this movie was and at the beginning of this movie I could tell this was going to be a very serious. As this movie progressed, I was constantly shocked, surprised, and floored by a remarkably well written, directed, and acted film. This movie truly blew me away. \"Spotlight\" is very subdued in a lot of ways, the movie doesn't make the news reporters look like heroes but rather look like actual news reporters who love their job and just want the truth of this scandal to reach the public. The fact that this is based on a true story is absolutely incredible. \"Spotlight\" directed by Tom McCarthy and with great Hollywood stars like Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schreiber \"Spotlight\" hit the big screen in November 2015.\n\nIn 2001, editor of the Boston Globe Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) assigns a team of journalist to investigate allegations against a priest named John Geoghan, who was accused of molesting over 80 boys in the city of Boston. Led by editor Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (Michael Keaton), who runs a team of reporters such as Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) and Sachas Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), interview the rape victims of these priest and uncover sensitive information that would relieve the truth of what is really going on within the Roman Catholic Church. These brave reporters make is their mission to find proof that there is a cover-up of sexual abuse of girls and boys by the priest that are said to make these children feel safe within the Roman Catholic Church. No matter how many obstacles these reporters faced nothing would stop them from uncovering the truth.\n\n\"Spotlight\" is a film that is so well acted and directed that as you watch it you almost forget that you are actually watching a film, you feel like it is a documentary. The story is so well told that you truly feel these true events are happening right before your eyes despite the fact you know you are looking at Michael Keaton and you know he played Batman or the fact that Mark Ruffalo is the Hulk. Michael Keaton is fantastic in this film and the performance he delivers is absolutely breathtaking with his snarky remarks and straight forward attitude. But the one scene that really tugged on my heart strings was when Mark Ruffalo's character, wanting to publish the story early because he knew that this injustice in the Catholic Church needed to be put in the light but Michael Keaton's characters knew that waiting was the right call because the team still needed more informations to truly take this institute down. Ruffalo's heart warming speech was so well acted it truly had me feel his emotions right through the screen.\n\nThis film truly excels in making the audience feel for these victims and the reporters trying to get their stories out there. With amazing performances from all of the cast and a great director behind the chair this movie truly is worth watching. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know the truth of how real journalism works and that it is a tough job as any. This film is definitely for a more mature audience and I wouldn't recommend it for children but showing this film to a child would teach them a valuable lesson and that is the world is a dark and scary place but you shouldn't be afraid to seek the truth."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Spotlight\" is based on a real-life story surrounding the scandalous reveals of decade-long hushed-up affairs of sexual abuse in the Boston bishopric conducted by the reporters of the Boston Globe. The hot-potato-topic is an important addition to the already global critical discourse regarding pedophilia in the Catholic Church and a condemnation of its practice of merely removing child molesting priests to other parishes. The portraits of victims, already formed adults with families or single, gay or straight, but with the common characteristic of suffering badly under the suppressed trauma of the abuse, are both touching and revealing. It shows how deep you need to dig to find the source of suffering in a person, and how a fear of stigmatization can turn a person into a psychological mess, whereas the real culprits remain unpunished. In many communities, the Church plays a central role in terms of social life or can even be the only way out of peril for destitute people and children from troubled backgrounds. Which makes exposing the very people who help you as monsters in disguise even harder, bordering on unbearable. Coming from a country heavily influenced by religious institutions, I know how it feels to try to speak up against them and to feel the herds of their brainwashed flock coming at you.\n\nMark Ruffalo and Liev Shreiber did a great job here, and quite unexpectedly, the movie earned a best pic Oscar. An upside of the film could be that, similarly like in Burnt, we see a very accurate description of work dynamics in a newspaper HQ, with the difference of the former happening in a restaurant kitchen. If there's anything one could point at as a flaw, it's the fact that the film borders on documentary in terms of style and you can't help thinking it could be reduced to a 45-minute long doc on sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic church, with no losses in terms of its effect on the viewer."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spotlight is a movie, based on true events. The Boston Globe is an extremely well renowned & popular paper, for the people of Boston. The Spotlight team of The Boston Globe, consisting of Mike Rezendes(Mark Ruffalo), Walter 'Robby' Robinson(Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer(Rachel McAdams) & Matt Carroll(Brian d'Arcy James), is the investigative journalism section of The Boston Globe. They are searching for the next story they are going to report. Enter new editor, Marty Baron(Liev Schreiber). He tells team Spotlight, to thoroughly research the major scandal of child molestation within the Boston Catholic Archdiocese. Baron also asks them to find out how the Catholic Church covered this up & why no major newspaper publication got a wind of this thoroughly disturbing story. What the Spotlight team discovers, is extremely shocking. The truth that comes out, rocks the Catholic Church & the whole city of Boston to its very core.\n\nSpotlight is an extremely engaging & mind blowing film! The masterful direction by Tom McCarthy & the script by Josh Singer & McCarthy flawlessly depicts the struggle that the Spotlight team went through, to publish this story. What's absolutely wonderful & unique about this film is that, the entire 2 hours of its run-time, is just the characters researching & discussing the scandal & the victims narrating their harrowing experiences. Its commendable that in spite of not showing us anything that the victims go through, via flashbacks & what not, when the viewer listens to their story, you can't help but feel emotional. This movie just tells the story as it is. No comedic set pieces, melodramatic set pieces or, unnecessary subplots focusing on each individual reporter. The highlight of the film, is the performances. How else can you intently watch a film, that only has people interacting with each other. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Mike Rezendes. He truly deserves his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Michael Keaton is brilliant as Walter 'Robby' Robinson. Keaton's subtle yet nuanced portrayal as the leader of team Spotlight, is vastly different from his previous role, as the protagonist in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)(2014). Rachel McAdams is amazing as Sacha Pfeiffer. McAdams definitely deserves her first ever Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as the strong willed reporter. Liev Schreiber is great as Marty Baron. John Slattery is awesome as Ben Bradlee Jr. Brian d'Arcy James is impressive as Matt Carroll. Stanley Tucci is spectacular as Mitchell Garabedian. The supporting characters are great as well. The cast of Spotlight truly deserve their Best Acting Ensemble triumphs, at the Critics' Choice Awards & the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Spotlight is a must watch for everyone, whether you like dramas or not. A masterpiece!"

The Globe story put an end to his and others parish hopping. The movie reinforced it and got a few others. Any movie that puts pedophiles in jail gets 10 in my book!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Journalists around us a somewhat deluded epic film that we love to remember in times of discouragement. New Moon (1940) and The Front Page (1974) remind us, even now, how bright and cynics (kindhearted) we can become. All the President's Men tells us about the meaning of all this. Much of what we do not unmask presidents, no; but if he is honest and does the job, with that it is enough for us. Although, evoking films to boost the morale, nothing like the fourth power (1952), Richard Brooks. Especially when the rotary is put to work: the roar of truth. Well, that sound of printed paper machines and also resonates in the Spotlight effective. But when it comes we are not so innocent: we have a broader and less heroic vision of journalism.\n\nIn that sense, Spotlight, Tom McCarthy of which already talked about the same in the series The Wire- is superior to all the above films. A work to the glory of daily work. Would fail to reflect the many hours on the computer, but then it would be dirty realism, and Spotlight takes more air and judicial thriller film. It tells the story -based on real events of a group of journalists from the Boston Globe, which revealed how the church had covered pedophile cases. Yes, the Boston church is not the Mafia or send assassins. There is nothing of that; as nothing in the making of the film called exaggeration or excess. We are facing a proposal details resulting from a tremendous effectiveness. Nor we find any deep throat or secret dossiers. Only traces of a conspiracy involving many, and some journalists tired, played with conviction.\n\nAlthough more than priests and journalists, speaks Spotlight something that corrodes the truth from within: the blind spots; the camel in the middle of the room that nobody sees, not even veteran journalists. The truth is out there, it is true, and Spotlight reminds us what it takes to conquer. And who, in the end, takes care of it ...\n\nAnother movie against discouragement"

The picture in this case is the systematic concealment by the Catholic Church in Boston of its decades-long, state-wide dealings with almost 100 paedophile priests. I hope that this movie will give more courage to the people who were molested to step up. When I first saw Spotlight , I couldn't resist picking favourites from its capable cast. And it was Ruffalo who jumped out, all but literally: his Rezendes is like a humanoid West Highland terrier, scampering into rooms to quickly get the measure of them, ears pricked, nose twitching and wet. He gives a brilliantly calibrated physical portrayal of a born investigator \u2013 in one scene, when he arrives in a lawyer's office, he even scrutinises the chair in the foyer before warily taking a seat."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a subgenre of films about working professionals doing their jobs professionally that I admire quite a bit. They tend to be quieter, less melodramatic, and with more restrained performances that allow for subtler and deeper emotions to seep into the audience, and Spotlight is just that sort of film (well, except for Mark Ruffalo). It tells a highly emotional story in restrained terms that don't force emotions upon its viewing public, ending up with a deeply penetrating look at the abuse of power by the Catholic Church in Boston.\n\nIn the build up to John Geoghan's trial for sexual molestation, The Boston Globe receives a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), a Jewish man direct from another newspaper in Miami, who talks to the editor of the Globe's deep investigatory unit, the titular Spotlight, Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton), who tells him that the sealed documents in the Geoghan case should be Spotlight's next focus. On a certain level, it's obvious that Baron doesn't quite understand the hornet's nest he's going to kick up by asking for the unsealed documents, but it's obvious that he also doesn't care. There's a story there, and that's the job of a newspaper, to find a story. So, much to Ben Bradlee Jr.'s (John Slattery) exasperated resignation, Robby gets his team, Michael Rezendez (Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James), to start digging.\n\nThe first place to go is the lawyer representing Geoghan's victims, Mitch Garabedian (Stanley Tucci), someone with a reputation of a crackpot (with the hair to match), but who is a cleareyed man with a focus only on helping his clients, dismissing Rezendez because he doesn't have time for one time reports, especially when he's already talked (this becomes a running motif). Sacha and Matt focus on tracking down the victims themselves, mostly filtered through Phil Savino (Neal Huff), leader of a non-profit for survivors called SNAP who hands them a box of materials he insists he sent to the Globe several years previously, and the Globe did nothing with it. At the same time, Sacha and Robbie visit Eric MacLeish (Billy Crudup), a high-powered lawyer with a history of helping represent victims but remains tightly bound by ethical rules to prevent him from talking in too much detail.\n\nThis is a lot of pieces, but it's just that kind of film. There is a lot of ground to cover, and the film balances those mechanics of a large plot that involves legal machinery and events that are never recreated, only spoken of, with enough small character moments for our protagonists to actually feel like real people, like Sacha, a lapsed Catholic, taking her grandmother to church, or Matt discovering a dark secret about a house down the street and leaving notes on his refrigerator warning his kids to stay away. Rezendez, though, only lives for work (there is talk of a wife he's on a break from), and Ruffalo plays him super-intensely. I find it hilarious that he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor because he feels so out of place. Everyone else is professional and collected, and every scene Ruffalo is in it feels like he's about to pop his top. I don't think he's very good in this.\n\nThe team figures out new ways to attack the central question, always pushed quietly by Baron to expand the scope of the issue to get as big a picture as possible, and they discover that Geoghan is only a drop in the bucket of the Archdiocese of Boston, leading to dozens of potential predatory priests (their initial numbers go to 87 and their reporting beyond that gets them to 70 of those 87). In between all of this are interviews with more victims, like Joe Crowley (Michael Cyril Creighton) who describes how he was groomed by Father Shanley. The very straightforward approach to the telling, just letting the character speak through the events, is really effective without becoming exploitative like a recreation would have (aside from the fact that anything we see in a film we're more likely to believe automatically).\n\nIt's the story of a steady climb over a mountain of filth in an effort to expose a terrible practice and the terrible administration of Cardinal Law (Len Cariou) who decided that the best thing to do was to shuffle these problem priests from one parish to another every couple of years, a practice used for decades and brought to light by the hard reporting of the Spotlight team. And yet...as Robbie says in a late scene, none of this information was new (well, some of it, like the sealed documents). They had all the pieces. They ran little stories in the Metro section about it every few years, not finding the editorial excuse to pursue the stories any further until an outside came in and told them to do it. Rezendez insists that the story needed Spotlight, the dedicated investigatory team, but, Robby reminds him, Spotlight started in 1970, thirty years prior.\n\nThe cast is uniformly good (except Ruffalo whom I think I may just not like very much), but I think it's Stanley Tucci who is the unsung hero of the cast. His role as Garabedian is not the biggest, but he's so smart in his delivery, almost witty as he lays out tricks of the law (his description of how he got sealed documents into the public is weirdly compelling) all with this combination of detachment and deep earnestness, a cynic who's been fighting a losing battle for so long that he can't see victory only the drudgery of the battle ahead, is delivered with such precise care by Tucci that I think he's the best single element on screen.\n\nBut this is really an ensemble picture, which is why Ruffalo's performance doesn't bother me that much regarding the whole film. It all collects together into this incredibly compelling package, a look at professionals doing their job while uncovering a horror underneath society. It's great."

        "review_detailed_main": "A team of journalists are determined to uncover a scandal about child molestation in the circles of the Catholic Church. At first it seems like isolated cases, but it turns out that things go deep, really deep.\n\nSpotlight has a heavy subject matter and its power lies in the fact that it doesn't hold anything back, it shows the hard truth, it exposes all the ugliness and the hypocrisy. And it's not just the Catholic Church. When so many people know about it and they either look the other way or try to take advantage of the situation, then you know that everything is broken.\n\nApart from the scandal itself, the second big story of the movie is how all that information became public. One could argue this is the central theme. Spotlight doesn't focus neither on the victims nor on the offenders. Instead, it is seen through the eyes of people who are journalists before anything else. Their personal lives take a back seat to the passion to discover the truth, the agony of hitting a dead end, the sheer will to continue despite the odds and of course the joy a breakthrough. All in all, an ode to journalism.\n\nWondeful cast, everyone is on point.\n\nIf there's a complaint to be made, it would be that this documentarish take on the events portrayed here leads to a lack of dramatic tension and emotional involvement for some viewers -myself included -, meaning it might not be as moving or memorable in the end, but that's something subjective and it's hard to fault Spotlight for taking that approach."

There are a couple of moments like that, certainly, but this movie isn't about pedophilia, it's about investigative journalism, and the film is tightly focused on the investigatory elements, with just a seasoning of victims and of reporters anguish over knowing something they can't tell people (yet).\n\nThis movie is very much in the vein of All the President's Men, to the point where I would expect everyone who likes one to like the other (although movie enthusiasm is never that one to one, so I'm sure I'm wrong). This movie is very interested in evidence and procedure, yet also explores the way in which terrible things can be protected by the status quo, and the way powerful interests try to control the debate.\n\nThere are some sad moments, and there are many that will make you furious, but overall you will be riveted by the story and impressed by the acting and direction."

For ounce, what the Spotlight team uncovered, though far too late, was an example of what journalism should be. Unrelenting, focused, and guided by the public interest.\n\nThe film captures this and evokes the enormity, depravity, and emotion of the time. It accomplishes this through mature direction, a phenomenal ensemble cast, and intelligent dialogue. It's not always easy to watch, yet something that gains in appreciation as we confront what we don't want to.\n\n4.5/5 Stars"

Starring: Mark Ruffalo, Rachel MacAdams, Micheal Keaton, and Liev Schreiber and Directed by Tom McCarthy. The investigative reporter team on the Boston Globe, known as Spotlight, is assigned to probe the allegations of a priest, John Geoghan, molesting over 80 boys. This leads to the discovery of the Cathlic church covering up sexual abuse cases not just in Boston, but all over the world. Spotlight puts a spotlight on the unsung heroes of the Boston Globe. While they aren't knights and shining armour, Tom McCarthy finds a way to make us see the mundane, cross referencing and double checking life of the average journalist in a new and exciting perspective. I was kept on the edge of my seat while the not often suspenseful gray and beige tones of khakis and work appropriate attire was made exciting and hitchcockian. What's impressive is how you can see into all of the investigator's personal lives. They put aside the beliefs they grew up learning to passionately reach towards piecing together this massive new story even if it meant challenging something they were taught to trust blindly. It also displays just how deep the Catholic hierarchy dug its nails into Boston's political system. The power of the press was perfectly executed as captivating and root- worthy in this tale of good vs. Exposing evil. The use of montages were expertly used as they speed up gaps of time that can be considered boring and transforms it into something sensational. Overall Spotlight is an amazing, gripping movie about people that are far overlooked and is worth the two hours."
