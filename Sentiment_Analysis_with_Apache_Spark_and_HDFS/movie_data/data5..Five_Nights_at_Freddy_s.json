(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)\n\nActing wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.\n\nHow to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.\n\nJust fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF."

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.\n\nI honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline \"cheese\", parody territory.\n\nThe positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.\n\nEverything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up."

The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!\n\nUnfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you were a tween in the 2010s, you are no doubt excited to see this beloved horror franchise leap from your PC to the big screen as the latest nostalgia film eager to cynically part you from your money. Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.\n\nFar from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.\n\nLittle in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.\n\nWhat about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.\n\nAs Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just fresh out of the cinema after seeing Five Nights at Freddy's, so here's my spoiler free review for it.\n\nNow, personally, I don't find the actual concept of FNAF all that scary so I personally wasn't \"scared\" watching this. The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.\n\nThe sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.\n\nNow, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering \"Can I take my kid to see this?\". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.\n\nThe \"twist\" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.\n\nOut of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think \"Is this a horror film?\". It's not \"balls-to-the-wall\" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.\n\nOverall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies."

Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me."

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.\n\nI think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.\n\n6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Five Nights at Freddy's\" is a film that seems to stay faithful to the games, especially in its portrayal of the creepy animatronic characters that capture the eerie spirit of the game's characters. Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.\n\nOn the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience."

After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.\n\nLore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.\n\nThe acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.\n\nThe atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.\n\nThe music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)\n\nAt the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for."

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.\n\nWhile the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole \"kidnapped little brother\" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.\n\nThe film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..\n\nAnyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film."

Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.\n\nVerdict\n\nI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really \"Got\" them which frustrates me.\n\nThe concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.\n\nAlas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.\n\nWhen the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.\n\nFIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.\n\nRants\n\nI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.\n\nBreakdown\n\nLooks the part Matthew Lilliard is decent here Hutcherson always looks like he's bored Weak kills Pants plot Too much melodrama."

Having played FNAF since it first came out in 2014, I was so excited to see the adaptation for the movie 9 years later. If you are like me, DO NOT get your hopes up.\n\nThe movie plot had potential, but was boiled down to a cheesy thriller that had maybe four or five callbacks to the incredibly extensive lore that Scott Cawthon established over the years with the Five Night's at Freddy's game series. I believe the PG-13 rating suits it perfectly- very VERY little gore, no drugs, no drinking, etc. So, if you are watching for the story-line alone, I would say it's not a good watch for you unless you are a younger teenager looking for a fun thriller with a few scary scenes.\n\nThe visuals, however, were INCREDIBLE. Truly, I could not imagine a better real-life interpretation of the animatronics. You can look up the animatronic pictures online and get a good feel of how amazing they are. Not sure I would recommend the movie for the visuals.\n\nOverall, Five Night's at Freddy's is an incredibly below average thriller film with phenomenal visuals. The plot barely scratches the surface of the lore behind the entire game series. Not worth the watch."

I used to talk to friends about each game and watch countless hours of theory videos. I even remember coming back from school each day, holding my breath when I refreshed the website showing sneak peaks of the next game.\n\nThe models of the animatronics were superb, they were nearly perfect. The only complaint I have is how their eyes just glowed a lame hue of orange whenever they got mad, which does not compare to the hollow white dots of the exoskeleton beneath that you'd constantly see in the franchise.\n\nThe story and characters were underwhelming. Not at one point throughout the movie did I feel like I genuinely cared about any of it, even though I tried to. There was no suspense, horror or fun. I even started to doze off near the end.\n\nOverall, I do think that any fan of the franchise should give this movie a go, just for the sake of viewing more content. But, I do not recommend to people that haven't been invested from the start."

The fan service made the film worthwhile. Storyline felt rushed and incomplete. The big ending one of the most impactful and significant events seemed brushed over and honestly not amazing, it felt rushed aswell as over simplified. Cameos and fan service was enjoyable but that's what they're there for. If it wasn't for them it wouldn't be enjoyable as characters motives are weak and change with little influence. The entire premise was weak with how we interacted with the animatronics."

However it's far different from the video game and for me was rather unexpected. Don't expect that the security guard Mike will be sitting in a room with CCTV through the film, he won't. Moreover, he won't be the only victim of animatronics.\n\nExcept for Mike there was a police officer, who was also engaged in investigation of animatronics night activity for some reason (no spoilers at this point) as well as Mike's younger sister, who eventually was the one to get everyone in troublejust becauseofher own curiosity.\n\nI can't say it is a scary film at all. It only has about 6 screamers. Well, there also were some disgusting scenes at the end, but they are more disgusting, than scary. And in my view, they'd better didn't include them, as I find them disrespectfulfor the viewers.\n\nAll in all, fans of the game can see the other, extended legend of what's happening in pizzeria. But don't think this will be a masterpiece. I would rate it as 6.5 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I came into this movie during opening weekend with an open mind. I knew a bit about the five nights at freddys lore and played a few games but I'm not particularly a huge fan.\n\nI'll start with the positives, the visuals were very well done throughout the film. I found the cinematography to be the best part of this film. Another aspect I have to have credit to is the animatronic designs and the way they are presented on screen.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with the film is the plot. I find that it was sequenced very poorly throughout the story. I didn't find myself interested in the story behind the main characters brother as I wasn't interested in him nor the rest of the characters. I found that my attention was focused on the next time I would see one of the animatronics. The characters were bland and uninteresting especially the police officer.\n\nThe movie ends in a twist that, if the rest of the movie had been good, may have been surprising.\n\nMy last problem is that the movie pays 0 homage to the video games that the movie was based on and I can't imagine how die hard fans of Fnaf feel about this lazy attempt of a blockbuster movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fans of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game series were eagerly awaiting the release of the film adaptation, but unfortunately, the results were less than stellar. The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.\n\nAs a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).\n\nThe film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.\n\nOverall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.\n\nI'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with."

Its kida like the movie just Said, We need a villan so late in to the movie. The kids Mike meets is kind a creepy if you ask me, but I feel that is not a good reason to cal then bad characters ther fine but kida creepy.

Josh Hutcherson as mike was a great casting choice and in my opinion, he basically is mike in real life.\n\nThere's plenty of easter eggs for fans and got me looking everywhere for secrets!! While the movie isn't exactly like the games, it's faithful enough that you can recognise it as a fnaf film and not some generic horror.\n\nLong story short, if your not a fan of fnaf, this movie probably isn't going to be good to you.

The story isn't fully fleshed out, leading to an unsatisfying ending.\n\nJosh Hutcherson does his best here, but is let down by a poor supporting cast with the exception of the actress who plays his sister Abby, and Matthew Lillard, who is great in everything he does.\n\nI suppose this film is good for a slumber party of tweens defying their parents. If you're outside this age group, you probably won't enjoy it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let's talk about good things first: Animatronics looked really amazing and real, they did a great job with them, cast is a bingo, cinematography and design is really nice, the lore was made pretty good (even tho it felt like it was rushed at the end) Now let's talk about some things that I personally didn't like (just my opinions): The movie lacked the point of the fnaf games and that is having a jumpscares. I feel like that was the really important thing too because that's the reason why fnaf is popular not only because of the lore but because of it's horror elements. The movie lacked that a lot. I guess there were myb 2 \"jumpscares\" which didn't even scare me. One thing that I really hoped that they would do is actually make it like a game where Mike needs to survive 5 days, losing his sanity, making sure he doesn't run out of power, make it feel like a real game so we can feel the suspense. Myb if they added more death scenes but since it's pg 13 we couldn't really get that and that sucks. First 50 min nothing was interesting to me, it seemed really boring but after 1h it got okay ig, we finally got some action going on. So yeah.. that's it, I do recommend the movie for the fans that know the lore."

I didn't play the games because they never interested me so idk if this is supposed to be a part of the story but wow was it a terrible story. The plot was so poorly thought out and cringy with almost no horror aspects at all. I thought it was supposed to be a horror movie, which from what I understand is what the video games were, but it ended up being a mystery movie kind of. The acting is horrible and the screen writing didn't help them. The interactions between the characters are so unrealistic and their emotions are so random and extreme. One character is so unnecessarily secretive it's frustrating. I'm really sorry if you're a fan of this franchise and I know you probably really want to like this movie but be realistic about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The only reason I didn't rate this 1 or 2 stars is because the animatronics look really good, for the VERY limited time you see them."

Five Nights at Freddy's (2023) gives a new vision of terror, this is a twisted horror tale with animatronics that begin to take on a life of its own, being consistently paced, adequately played and with a lot of gore, blood, twists and turns . Bizarre terror movie that's heavy on creepy scenes with acceptable, though mainly inside production design, including brilliant photography and over-the-top special effects.

His formula for making movies as inexpensively as possible does not mean looking for low-budget movies to see if he likes them, but looking for movies he likes, and then see if they can be done on a low budget. According Jason Blum himself his rules for making a cheap movie include: 1) Limit the amount of speaking parts, because actors with lines get an additional fee; 2) Limit the amount of locations (preferably only one); 3) Pay actors the legally minimum, and offer them a percentage of perspective profits; 4) Never break the budget, don't ask for more money.

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was an absolute let down given the absurd amount of time it has been in production. The movie does not follow the title it is meant to adapt in any note able capacity. In all fairness, I do not think an adaptation has to be beat for beat, and I am all for changes to existing content so as to not be alienating to new comers. With that being said, the movie is very clearly made for existing fans, but pays little mind to them in it's story telling. I can say with 100% certainty that anyone with no context of prior material would be lost to anything that was going on.\n\nI and all my long term obsessions with the games was lost for a good chunk of it myself. The only redeeming qualities about the film were the fantastic works by the Jim Henson company on the animatronics, the set design, and the inclusion of noteable music as a nod to fans without shameless and out of place cameos. I feel many of the actors' performances suffered greatly from poor direction, so I can't fault them to much. The film would've benefited greatly from an R rating, it's attempts to balance two audiences were clearly not placed in the right hands, and any gorey scenes felt like something you'd find in Birdemic.\n\nThe writers also appeared to be unwilling to stick to a tone, jumping between family friendly hallmark shenanigans and saw traps. Not to say this can't be done well, it can, but it wasn't. At the very least, it was a somewhat enjoyable watch. In the relm of so-bad-its-good through parts, and a complete drag through others. For just over an hour and a half movie, Avatar (the blue people one) feels shorter.\n\nOverall, it's terrible. A pretty shameless cash-grab through the majority, with a few moments of release that at least pulled a laugh or hype here and there. Not worth paying to see in theater, but if you're curious there is always peacock. TLDR.. it's bad. Sorry to all my fellow FNAF kids who were waiting for this one."

The plot couldve unraveled naturally showing both williams motive for killing the kids and shows mikes guilt at the same time. I have to assume they went the direction they did because of budget restrictions but honestly if that was the case, a film completely in the pizzeria with way more jumpscares wouldve been just fine. Also nothing about this film is scary and the pizzeria looked like it costed afton a million dollars, in the games they were always cheap buildings. All this film proves is scott truly has been \"winging it\" the whole time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Another week, another Blumhouse horror film.\n\nBased on a video game series (which I have no played), Five Nights at Freddy's is another 80s nostlgia horror flick. The plot revolves around a closed chucky cheese like restaurant from the 80s where the animatronics come to life and murder people.\n\nIt's a great premise, and the film certainly sets up some interesting ideas, and wisely gives the main characer some agency. He's a down on his luck guy who after losing his family cares for his kid sister, but suffers the same mysterious dream every night. Personally, I would have found it more plausible and interesting if the dreams had begun when he started working at Freddy's which would make more sense in light of the nature of the dream and his interactions therein.\n\nUnfortunately, once the female cop shows up, the film begins to come apart. She does not act like a cop at all, being entirely understanding and way too friendly, going for a walk and sitting down with him at the river at their second meeting. Yes, this is (poorly) expained later on, but the writing of their scenes is awful.\n\nThe best scenes in the film belong to the lawyer of the protagonist's aunt. He's hilarious. They set her up as a great antagonist, only to drop that entire plotline.\n\nThe animatronics are well designed and sufficiently creepy, but the film shies away from violence and never really commits to being a horror film. It seems to be more geared towards kids, especially with the \"fun\" scenes of partying and playing with the robots, but I'm not sure it really works. Much of the acting is pretty bad (especially the cop), with the protagonist never cracking a joke and wearing the exact same facial expression the entire movie. The second half suffers some real pacing issues, but the worst part is the ham fisted exposition dump that explains the robots. The moment the mystery is solved, you can feel the film deflating as the suspense is all but gone. You instantly know how it's going to end.\n\nMatthew Lillard of Scream fame is there again and does what you expect him to do. It drags on too long, and outstays its welcome, especially once we realize the horror we were promised isn't happening.\n\nA pity. WIth tighter editing and a bit more energy to the main characer, this could have been great."

I understand that one has to make some modifications to the original source, but I feel like the reason why movies or series made of loved videogames fall short is because they very often become so different from the original source and either add or change story lines that don't require any change, which just makes it weird for the viewer if they happen to be a fan.\n\nI think producers and directors should have learnt from the last of us adaptation, since it's one of the most well received adaptations like this. When you make this kind of content for the fans, use the source they already love. I'm probably going to see the second movie if they do end up making it, I'm not gonna lie, because I love the games and I wish the next one would be catered towards the fans who have waited years for this sort of a movie.\n\nI think the movie is still worth a watch, esprecially if you go into the movie expecting more of a humoristic spooky movie, don't really care about the details of the games and just want to see the animatronics come to life, I'm sure you'll enjoy it more! I just might have had a bit unrealistic expectations and the hype around the movie got to me."

It had good moments in terms of game references and a couple of good atmospheres like in games, but it was more kid friendly. In my opinion, both in terms of story and lore, it was good even for someone who doesn't know those games, only the HORROR part was missing. The acting wasn't the worst either, but it could have been better. Matthew Lillard played his role well, I was just disappointed he wasn't there that often. But at least I'm glad that a movie came out and the nostalgia that hit me. We were finally able to see animatronics on the big screen, and I appreciate them for that, but it could have been better if it hadn't been PG13. In short, the brutality, and that was lacking. Now I don't want every scene about killing but occasionally make it a real HORROR movie and not a movie that looks like a horror movie. The Kid-Friendly scenes didn't make sense when you first see robots killing and then,... Well, we know what happened next. On the other hand, they're still child souls in animatronics, but that switch in personality is really funny. I laughed incredibly at the cinema about it. And then right away it wants to go back to horror with killing. I left the cinema with mixed feelings. But in the end, it was probably cool. I didn't expect anything from it, so it didn't disappoint me. Hopefully, they will learn a lesson and the next movie will be better. If they somehow manage to connect the story of the sequel well with this movie, then it could help him. We just have to wait... There's still a lot of potential out there and I think they can learn and do it more CREEPY. In conclusion, I would say that I was not disappointed. The film is nicely shot, the sets are nice, the soundtrack is gorgeous, the acting is okay, the idea of the story is interesting but not finalized, and in short, it is a horror movie that is not a horror movie. I'm looking forward to the sequel, if they can nicely continue the story they started, it could be really interesting. According to some leaks, Scott himself decided to rewrite the script based on criticism. Hopefully, he can perfect it. Final Rating: 7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a fnaf fan, I really enjoyed this movie. The Animatronics and almost no CGI at all really shows the effort they put in the production of this film. The jumpscares, while few, were pretty good. I loved the characters, and I really liked what they did with Mike, they definitely made him more relatable and added depth into his character. The actors weren't half bad either.\n\nAlmost everyone who watched the movie was disappointed because it does not follow the video game lore, which is true for the most part, but I feel like changing the story and lore to make it more story-like and enjoyable was a good idea, and the changes they made were only for the better.\n\nThe reason I'm giving this movie a 6/10 is because the movie had so. Many. Plotholes. Not only that, but the movie went way too fast. I remember the one scene where Mike is talking to Vanessa about his brothers abduction, and it had the chance to be an emotional and character building moment for Mike, but it sadly wasn't. The movie was so focused on the animatronics and the \"five nights\" that it completely ignored the character arcs. Sure there were some scenes that were emotional, but it just wasn't enough. And I know that it's a horror movie and it's not supposed to be emotional, but when half the Fanbase is complaining about the movie not being a 10/10, then the emotional scenes were really a necessity. Also I wish they gave William Afton/Springtrap more screentime, because we barely got to understand his character.\n\nI hope this was clear enough, and I want to point out that just because I gave a 6/10 does not mean that I didn't enjoy the movie, it was truly a fun experience for me and I definitely recommend it if you have a group of friends to watch it with."

Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a \"who done it?\" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.\n\n3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just watched this with my 11 year old daughter. She's into the game and really wanted me to watch it with her. It wasn't what I expected. I was expecting something on the order of the Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street movies from the 80s. Scary and gory, but in a campy, sort of fun way. What I got was more akin to a Disney movie with a few more horror elements than most Disney movies. There is no intense gore. Some mild blood and mutilation shots, but these are few and far between, and really not at all disturbing to anyone who's a long time horror fan. A few jump scares, but even those are pretty tame. Acting is decent for the kind of movie it is (where you're not expecting too much anyway). It starts out fairly scary but then takes a somewhat silly turn towards the middle of the movie that really makes the rest of it fall kind of flat with respect to it's 'horror' aspects. It could have been a lot scarier and a lot more gory, but it's clear that the film makers wanted to keep it on more of a 'spooky fun' level, rather than making it a truly disturbing horror film. That's fine for a kids' movie, but will be somewhat disappointing to a more mature audience looking for an actual horror film. Overall, this is a great movie to watch with your kid who is just starting to get into the horror genre, but adults should not expect to be scared. Still entertaining though and worth a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently watched this film with my 8-year-old, who is slightly younger than its intended audience. While the movie echoes well-loved gateway horror films like NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS and BEETLEJUICE, it sets itself apart with a layer of classic horror intensity, making it more visceral than its counterparts.\n\nCrafted with a younger audience in mind, the film presents a story that's squeamish, inventive, and morally nuanced. It might appeal more to younger viewers, but adults might find it a tad niche.\n\nWhat sets it apart is its emphasis on story over mere jump scares. The film blends psychological horror with creatively unsettling animatronic kills.\n\nWhile certain scenes push the envelope, the film's inclination to tackle darker themes is evident. Even when the animatronics enact gruesome deaths, there's an underlying sense that the victims, given their own dubious moral standings, arguably had it coming.\n\nIn its execution, the movie steers clear of clich\u00e9s. Taking a page from WORLD WAR Z, it proves that effective horror isn't solely about gore. The performances are robust, the characters are fleshed out, and despite a somewhat intricate plot, it remains accessible.\n\nWhile familiarity with the game that inspired the movie can add layers to the viewing experience, it's by no means a prerequisite. The film stands firmly on its own, offering closure yet hinting at the possibility of sequels.\n\nThe exemplary quality of the animatronics underscores the significant effort and budget allocated to the production. This film doesn't just cater to a younger audience; it redefines horror for them, an approach I find commendable.\n\nFor adults seeking traditional horror thrills, this might fall short. Yet, it carves a promising path for youth-focused horror films. It captivated my child, and that's a resounding success in my view."

The concept of FNAF is not very scary to me. So I don't see the film as a horror movie but more as a thriller, maybe with horror elements. A few effective jump scares throughout the film but I wouldn't say I was filled with any kind of fear. Some moments have you questioning if you are even watching a horror film as it is more light despite the plot being fairly dark.\n\nThe setting is amazing-the restaurant looks incredible, I'm sure game fans appreciated it a lot, the robots look great mixed with the sound which makes it perfect when we see them on screen, it all works so well together. As a fan of the games it really made me appreciate the film more due to these reasons.\n\nThe films \"twist\" is some what predictable and almost called out earlier in the film. If you are going into this film blind without any knowledge of the games then you might be more surprised.\n\nThe cast was good, Stu from Scream comes back as a creepy old guy, love it. Josh Hutcherson is great needs more recognition haven't seen him in anything big since hunger games."

        "review_detailed_main": "Five Nights at Freddy's is a new horror film arrangement and written in part by Emma Tammi, director of The Wind. The films are based on the horror game of the same name.\n\nMike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) works as a night security guard at the local pizzeria Freddy Fazbear. He has to work here for five nights, but during these nights he discovers that something is wrong with the pizzeria's animatronic costumes. So he begins to learn about a dark secret.\n\nThis game adaptation works better for people who are familiar with the horror game, because it contains nice references and other easter eggs that link back to the game. People who don't know the game will not really understand these things.\n\nFor a game known for its jump scares, designed to frighten and further frighten players, the film strangely has almost none of these horror moments. This film sometimes seems more meaningful to younger viewers of just sixteen. For older viewers, the film is not scary and if they know nothing about the game, the film may be more unclear, or overcome separately.\n\nThe location of the famous pizzeria from the game seems positive, especially for people who are familiar with it. Since most movie studios didn't use CGI for this movie, the animatronic costumes of the Fazbear crew have to be brought into the movie. Jim Henson's Orphan Shop was responsible for the Fazbear crew. They are performed by puppeteers and stunt artists. This will get her across.\n\nHowever, the story of the film can be a problem for viewers of the film. In addition to the story around the pizzeria, it also tells the story of the main character. In addition to a dark past, he also has a struggle to retain the rights to raise his youngest sister. These storylines do not always correspond well with each other, which means that the film can sometimes be a bit unclear and difficult to overcome.\n\nThis inferior script sometimes makes it difficult for the actors to come across well. Josh Hutcherson sometimes remains a bit vague. He does come across well as an older brother who tries to take good care of his sister. His sister is played by Piper Rubio, who delivers some decent acting for a novice actress. The brother and sister actors have a well-known bond together. Matthew Lillard also plays a small role in the film, which he portrays appropriately. After his previous acting work in Scream and Scooby-Doo, it is also nice to see him again in this horror film."

The film makes the mistake of delving too deeply into the protagonist's story and the delay for the Animatronics to come into action, not to mention that it is not scary and the script is drawn out. The pizzeria setting and the Animatronics are perfect, identical to the games, but there are still some elements missing that gave the tension it had in the games and would work in the film if it were too (like the Animatronics only move when they are not being observed). The film is rated 3/5, it won me over for its nostalgia, references, Ester Eggs, the pizzeria setting and the Animatronics and it also lost me for its tiredness, the lack of violence, Jump Scare (which is part of the essence of the games) and it has almost all characters without charisma."

I personally have never been a fan, but I could still see the quality of the movie, it's just not for me. One of the issues I did have with the movie was how but didn't seem to have a central problem or plot. We seemed to get more and more smaller issues that at the end, our shadowed the main threat in my opinion. One thing I give praise to was the ending.

While I understand that being a long time fan of the series doesn't help my case here, I don't agree with most criticisms of the story, either- except for the pace that it's told at. We seemingly get half of the remaining missing context all at once at the start of the third act, and that can be overwhelming for newcomers to the series. If the sequel can up the horror, keep the story engaging, and do everything else that the first film did right, we'll hopefully start seeing more praise for this franchise."

It already served as an inspiration for the much better The Banana Splits Movie in 2019.\n\nWhat should be a gory comedy horror movie. Five Nights at Freddy's is a more serious movie about grief and loss masquerading as a horror film.\n\nMike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a security guard with many issues. He cannot get over the fact that his brother was abducted when he was a kid and was never found. Mike is unable to hold a steady job, hooked on pills and has anger issues.\n\nMike cares for his withdrawn younger sister Abby and faces a custody battle over her with his aunt Jane.\n\nHis career advisor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) gets him a job as a night guard at an abandoned family diner known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Mike reluctantly accepts as he needs the job to keep custody of his sister.\n\nOnly when he dozes off at work, it sort of amplifies the events leading up to his brother's abduction in his dreams. He also meets Vanessa Shelly, a cop who seems to know more about the history of the park.\n\nThen there are the creepy animatronic mascots. They come alive and kill some delinquents sent by aunt Jane to damage the diner, so Mike would get fired. The mascots later take an interest with Abby as they seem to bond with her when Mike brought her to work one day.\n\nThis is such an uneven film, I though it was two different kind of movies that got meshed together. The horror parts only comes alive much later. Even then it is tame in order to be a family friendly scary movie.\n\nThe similar themed Willy's Wonderland was more fun with a silent Nicolas Cage causing mayhem."

However, my friend wanted to, so we did.\n\nI will say, I was pleasantly surprised as to how watchable it is. Most of the acting is good, and the cinematography is well done. The effects are mostly great too.\n\nIt's main flaws are as follows:\n\nWhy wasn't this rated R? Was it aiming for a wider teenage audience? It's a horror movie lacking in any gore. There's some deaths sure, even some interesting ones. But when we ALL KNOW the premise: animatronic animals come to life and kill people, I think we're expecting some blood and guts. There's almost none of it.\n\nFar too much story, not enough horror. I will say it kept my attention, and it was mostly a decent story, but.... Why. It needlessly takes away from the killing and it's noticeable and the audience is mostly resentful of it. And what I mean is, the story is written in such a way that it doesn't set up many opportunities for horror. I doubt the story is taken from the games, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe story has a lot of loose ends. Things happen in the movie that would have consequences in real life (legal and criminal), and the story doesn't resolve that. It just keeps moving. Because of this the world they've built feels isolated and empty. It's not surreal enough to get away with this. There's also weird or unexplained motivations for certain characters. And they'll completely pull a 180 without explanation. And worse, the other characters don't react like \"wait, what?\". And there's all of these mentions of \"bad things that happened\" but zero explanation as to what that means. It makes it harder to relate to the experiences because we don't know what they even are. So at best we can have detached sympathy.\n\nI was pretty surprised I didn't hate it, and I wouldn't avoid it. However, now that I've seen it, I don't think I'll go out of my way to watch it again. It was \"okay, not bad.\""

The story and the script felt half baked and it felt that the story had more potential to have more thriller and horror elements. The screenplay was also uneven, the direction was average and the performances were above average. The suspense and the thrill were missing from the movie and it feels like a bland story from which you were expecting too much.\n\nOverall, I won't say that the movie was bad but it was neither good. It had it's moments and Irate it as an average."

I want to say something good about it but there is just so little. The whole movie just has an air of cheap new actors and old has beens. It is also way too long for a movie of this appallingness. 88 to 91 minutes would have sufficed but they made it 110 minutes for no obvious reason. Just an extra 20 minutes for the poor punter to endure. My advice is to just not bother....you will thank me for it in the long run."

Not recent references either, really old ones that newer fans might miss and older fans will love. This entire movie the leak LOVE. Love for the animatronics, the game, and the community as a whole.\n\nI really only have a few minor complaints. The ending, while mirroring events in the game, felt rushed and I wished there was just a bit more. Also it was clear sequel bait but it's fnaf and everyone knows that Scott is incapable of just making one. Even fnaf world got a sequel. Fnaf world.\n\nMy other complaint is that... it's not very scary. Maybe it's a me problem (I didn't find the shinning or exorcist scary either) but it was very fnaf security beach levels of horror. That being... not very. MAYBE a bit startling at points but I'm not going to bed paranoid. It's a shame but I guess it couldn't be too scary for the literal children that will come to this movie. But then again as I stated prior... I was in elementary (and enjoying this franchise) when it first came out.\n\nGore was light, but the minor parts of it was appreciated."

I'm guessing fans of the game were creating the excitement. I went in with an open mind though hoping to be pleasantly surprised. I was not sadly. This was the worst film I have seen in 2023.\n\nFirst of all, the film is incredibly boring. There is almost no horror in it. There's one scene near the midway point that would be considered horror I suppose, but it was probably the most boring scene in the entire movie. I understand the film is PG-13 but come on, give us something to work with.\n\nThen you have the unbearable characters. As if the adults weren't bad enough, the film adds an unlikable child to the centre of the story. Who thought that was going to be a good idea?\n\nThen there's the animatronic \"villains\" of the movie. I have never seen less scary creatures in a movie before. You could put these in a Disney Pixar movie and toddlers wouldn't be afraid of them.\n\nThe film is long for a horror movie, coming in at around 110 minutes, and it feels every bit of it. The pacing is non-existent. Long scene after long scene with nothing being added to the story. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked my watch.\n\nPeople who choose this film as their 2023 Halloween film are going to be annoyed and let down. It's safe, bland and could barely be called horror. A generous 3/10."

        "review_title": "The opinion of a non-fan",
        "review_detailed_main": "Fans love to defend movies that get blasted by critics. \"This is a movie for real people,\" they say. \"Not elitists in ivory towers.\" Well, sometimes critics are right, and honestly I get annoyed that fans are so eager to line up for buffets of mediocrity and chow down like they're being gifted filet mignon. \"Don't bother making any effort on our part,\" they say to movie studios, \"we'll be satisfied with any crap you want to feed us.\" Wouldn't it be nice if we held filmmakers to a higher standard? If your favorite IP could be made into a movie AND that movie could also be, you know, good? It's not actually an impossible dream. You just have to stop licking boots.\n\nOh, well. It's just a movie. It's not like lives hang in the balance, I guess. But they did get my money, so I think I have a right to complain.\n\nWhenever a much-anticipated movie takes forever to get into production, the excuse is always the same: the filmmakers are waiting for the right script. Then you see the finished film and think, \"THAT was the right script? Surely at least one of the other two dozen options from the slush pile was better than this one.\" Five Nights at Freddy's suffers from a standard plot involving a security guard with haunted eyes trying to pull his life together so his aunt won't take custody of his younger sister. Yawn. But wait, if you were worried the dour protagonist doesn't have a Tragic Backstory, you're in luck! His younger brother (a different younger sibling than the one he's raising now) was abducted from a campsite when they were children, and Older Brother feels responsible as the only witness. Do his recurring nightmares about the incident tie in somehow with the current spooky shenanigans unfolding at the arcade-slash-pizza-place known as Freddy Fazbear's? If you think they do not, you've obviously never seen a film before.\n\nDespite the story being so thin you could use it as tissue paper next time you're wrapping a gift, the screenwriters (including FNaF creator Scott Cawthon and director Emma Tammi) stretch the rusty plot mechanics to nearly two hours. Why? Who knows? Even the pre-FNaF cash-ins like The Banana Splits Movie and Willy's Wonderland were smart enough to keep the action under 90 minutes. The film is chock full of characters that absolutely do not matter, like love-interest/cop Vanessa (fulfilling the obnoxious archetype of \"character who knows more than she lets on about the scary goings-on but refuses to adequately warn the main character so he has no idea what kind of trouble he's getting himself into until it's too late for everybody\") and waste-of-time-and-talent sneerfest Aunt Jane, perplexingly played by the overqualified '90s ingenue Mary Stuart Masterson. I guess everybody needs a paycheck. The screentime dedicated to superfluous characters ensures that our main protagonists, sadboy Mike and his preadolescent sister Abby, receive zero of the development necessary to actually make them interesting or complex.\n\nThere's exactly one good scene in Five Nights, involving a group of intruders getting picked off one at a time by the animatronics. Tammi shows the aplomb of a PG-13 Sam Raimi, energizing the sequence with rapid-fire editing and kinetic camera movements and suggesting violence with shadows and abstractions that feel like fun artistic choices rather than concessions to the MPAA. Would that Tammi had been let off the leash more often. As we were treated to the umpteenth scene of Josh Hutcherson attempting to interrogate ghosts in his repeating dream, I kept myself awake by pondering why Cawthon was apparently so insistent that his hollow, schlocky video game premise be turned into this turgid melodrama instead of an adrenaline-fueled, no-holds-barred free-for-all. The final showdown, unfortunately, commits the greatest sin of all: anticlimax.\n\nMy two notes of genuine appreciation for the film come down to the impressive, full-size animatronics created by the Jim Henson shop--thank God the film avoided CGI--and Matthew Lillard working his butt off to be the same gleeful scenery-chewer he was back in Scream, albeit with a much weaker character this time around. Other than that, I suppose I'm just glad the film avoids the same cynical, empty \"wokespeak\" that plagues other franchises aiming for Gen Z (not a self-conscious reference to \"patriarchy\" or \"gaslighting\" throughout the entire runtime, wonder of wonders). It's a tired movie, but at least it's merely tired in its old-fashioned storytelling rather than in a futile attempt to be up-to-the-minute as bait for \"teh kidz\".\n\nIf you're going to see it, see it in the theater, with fans of the video games attending in full cosplay regalia, cheering at Easter eggs and applauding any moment that musters even a smidgen of genuine entertainment value. I did, and the atmosphere accounted for about 80% of the actual fun quotient of the entire experience."

The story, while not entirely uninteresting, still seems convoluted and only holds the movie back even more when it comes to actually being scary or creating a chilling atmosphere. This seems to me like a fine hommage to the original games, which you'll probably find some way to enjoy if you're already a fan of the series. For everyone else though, it's neither that interesting, nor scary. There aren't any interesting stylistic devices present and most moments are either completely forgettable or immediately obvious.\n\nOverall I'd give it a watch if you're somewhat interested in the franchise. It's not unwatchable, Just really generic."

And I thought they were gonna get progressively better than they were in early ears in video game adapted movies. But I guess not all of them can be good. Five Nights at Freddy's is just another soulless video game adaptation that only wants to make this movie cash out the games. While it may have some good visuals that stay true to the games with the animatronics and the details on the pizzeria, the movie would provide a plot that relies on just Mike and his arc about his family issues to the point of becoming predictable. I'll give the movie for trying, but the story around the pizzeria doesn't happen until the third act. Also, the movie is not as scary as you may think. In fact, the movie barely has any scary moments. Most we would get is just characters playing around the pizzeria and the animatronics interacting the one character, but not in a thrilling way. And not to mention with how the characters have been handled. Mike being the punching bag and Abby's interactions to the animatronics. And their connection don't really affect much. I think the best recommendation is this will be for the die hard FNAF fans. After all, they have been asking for many years if there would be an actual FNAF movie, and here we are. You'll probably enjoy it. Outside of that, I don't think it would be worth a watch. It would be better to play the games instead. Actually, I even recommend the fan SFM videos on YouTube. At least some of them can have enjoyable storytelling. As for the actual movie, the only thing we would get is just disappointing and easily dull. I guess I'll just wait for Sonic The Hedgehog 3 next year. Happy Halloween."

If you wanna see the movie just for animatronics you won't be dissappointed. Movie keeps fans in mind, there are some cameos and they showed parts of the FNAF lore that fans would be most interested in. Special and practical effects look really good too.\n\nCons: Overall direction is not good, they wanted to give a whole movie this hollywood look with many colorful lights that envoke 80s feel. Now it does look pretty but it doesn't stay faithful to the original material. Story is too simple and straight forward, if you are familiar with the franchise you already know what's going to happen. Acting is kinda dull at times too. But I gotta say rating is what ruins the movie. Because it's PG-13 a lot of violent and bloody scenes took place off screen or in the dark I just wish we got more stuff going on beacuse that's the entire point of FNAF.\n\nOverall even tho it's not that great and it falls flat I would still recommend people to see it. It is entertaining at times. It's so nice to see the franchise come to life considering everything that was going on and how long it took to finally make FNAF movie. I just wonder if it might bave been better in someone else's hands."

I'm happy with what was done. The plot is great, and of course the jumpscares aren't gonna be scary because of the audience you're trying to surround this movie with.

And of course, it's a movie adaption so it doesn't have to follow along as it can be something completely different from the source media. But if it was, it probably would've been much better. This movie sucks unless you want to get a few laughs from how bad it is or have some mindless entertainment. The costumes or whatever the animatronics are are really good. The acting isn't the best and every time you think you'd get to see someone's death, it cuts away. It does get points for the end credits song and all the other references to the original games. Not to mention the cameos. There are barely any jump scares in here- that work at least. Maybe i just didn't understand they were jump scares because of how bad they were. I thought i was going to be at least a little scared while watching this but it was pretty hilarious. I do hope the sequel that is clearly being set up by the ending is better. I hope the fnaf movie will be in its own universe that is separate from the games."

The plot is really where the movie shines, it's surprisingly sweet and had me hooked.

However, all this looks too exaggerated and absurd. The main character, although he has suffered a tragic loss, does not have a pronounced personality, which leads to his confused and hypo-optimistic behavior throughout the film. Originally intended for a teenage audience, the film contains violent scenes that make it unacceptable for viewing for this age group. On the other hand, it is of no interest to adult viewers, because it is built on the principle of ghosts and lacks logical coherence of what is happening. The actions of the extras in animatronic beast costumes are very slow, but when the dolls become invisible, they suddenly acquire supernatural speed and the ability to manipulate door locks. I can safely advise you to refrain from watching this movie, because it can seriously disturb your mental state. At the same time, it is worth recognizing that its cinematic component is competently executed."

That sounds like a great horror movie. It's a shame this isn't remotely it.\n\nThe movie is an actual slog fest that is more focused on adapting the lore, rather than being a competent horror movie. The games are notable for their jump scares and this movie only had 2 which is mind-boggling. I dislike horror movies that are reliant on jump scares but this movie would have actually benefitted if it had more because it was so boring. This movie not being scary at all, is my biggest disappointment. The plot is stupid, the characters are uninteresting, and a lot of the scenes are incredibly goofy (that fort-building scene sticks in my mind).\n\nStill, the animatronics look terrific and the set design feels like it was pulled right from the games. It is also filled with easter eggs that fans will love. The sound design is also great and can be quite unsettling. I can see fans liking this movie. However, a YouTube video talking about FNAF lore is more interesting than this."

Why not just embrace the supernatural and let that be the explanation for most things.\n\nThe big brother is just stupid - I am tired of self-destructive no-good characters. It is just very hard to be sympathetic and be on his side when he keeps making so poor choices. And trauma or mental sickness does explain the choices.\n\nThis is not scary at all, just kinda weird and frustrating to watch."

There isn't really any gore. If, like me, you go into this not knowing much about the \"lore\", you'll probably appreciate the way the story unfolds a little more & be surprised. My teens enjoyed the movie & said that there were some differences between the game backstory vs the movie storyline, but the main elements were the same. Matthew Lillard was fun to watch, as always! The movie ended in a way that there could certainly be a a sequel, but there wouldn't absolutely have to be. Overall, it was a fun movie!"

It starts out with some horror promise, but this quickly deflates once the main characters and story come into play. My main question was- was this written during the writers strike by stand ins because omg. What. A. Mess. The dialog and acting borders the ridiculous and then pole vaults waaaaay over it once \"Vanessa\" arrives on the scene. What is wrong with this character? Her lines, moods, and acting is ALL over the map! Calm and demure one second, then with her very next sentence is ready to murder. ROFL! People in our theater were laughing after every one of her completely over-the-top lines and not in a good way either. She was an absurd character with almost zero purpose other than to provide poorly written plot exposition and unintentional comedy. \"If you bring Abby back here, I will SHOOT you.\" Comic gold offered up with complete seriousness- this line had our theater in stitches. One of M. Night Shyamalan's over the top disastrous characters would be hard pressed to keep up w/ ol' Vanessa's \"acting\" lol!\n\nThe rest is a forgettable mess of wretched acting, boring family drama, boring pacing, a needlessly convoluted \"plot\", and lukewarm \"horror\". Honestly this felt like a throwaway movie of the week by a first time director. Nothing to offer. Josh Hutcherson's done much better and it was sad to see him in such a turd of a film. Maybe it will reach cult popularity due to its awfulness and stupidity a-La Rocky Horror, but even that'd be a stretch. Avoid it unless it's streaming and you need to numb your brain."

This movie has none of that.\n\nHonestly, I think this would have been a MUCH better movie, both for long-time fans and for newcomers, if it stuck closer to the story of the games. There are so many moments that I was convinced were setting up for one of the plot points in the game, like Vanessa's knowledge of Freddy's, and how weird she acted when asked about Mike's brother, which I was certain would lead back to how she gets brainwashed by the antagonist in the games, but turned out to just be a case of iffy acting and a plot twist that just serves to contradict the games even further.\n\nIf you're a FNAF fan looking for a movie to clarify the lore, or even to demonstrate a basic understanding of it, I would recommend looking to fanmade projects to satisfy that want. This is a good movie, but a bad Five Nights at Freddy's movie.\n\nPros: very good atmosphere, Josh Hutcherson eye candy, impressive animatronics, might be a good base for some fanfiction writers.\n\nCons: convoluted disconnected and inaccurate story, iffy child acting, understanding of the lore at the same level as someone who watched a game theory video 8 years ago and was just asked to recall every detail (which is odd considering the literal creator of the first 8 or so games worked on this movie.)"

And just like Willy's Wonderland, the film squanders any potential for a wild and gory white-knuckle ride, director Emma Tammi delivering a very tame experience that focuses more on security guard Mike's troubled past and his relationship with his young sister Abby (Piper Rubio) than it does on the horror of being stalked and killed by homicidal machines.\n\nAvid gamers might enjoy seeing the characters come to life on the big screen, but I imagine even the most forgiving of Freddy fans will be disappointed by the lack of atmosphere, thrills and OTT violence in this uninspired Blumhouse misfire."

I know the movie may not follow the games or lore exactly, however, this exposure to the franchise makes me want to play the games, learn the lore, and read the graphic novels.

He is struggling for work, so when a new job comes his way, he takes it. Even with the bad hours. He decides to join, Freddy Fazbears workplace. It gets a bit predictable when he works out that the Anamametronics aren't quite as they seem, a regular trope. But it does work for the film.\n\nWhat didn't make much sense is why his aunt was trying to end his career. And markes him down in a patronising way, she was very annoying throughout the film. She tries to get a gang to wreck the place, and cause havoc. As they do. However, this angers the anomotronics and we see a bloodbath. Also, why was the Carer of Mike's little sister Abby slightly against him. Max seems nice and friendly, but she's also not sure which side she's on.\n\nBut, the Anamotronics are well handled, they move and are structured and designed exactly the same as the game. In every way, the costumes look really realistic and there eyes, when they change is really effective. They also move like the video games show. Every detail about them is impressive, down to the last minute details. They look very much like the game. And I like how they are all different, with very different strengths.\n\nThe Police officer didn't make sense either, why didn't she warn Mike about the Anamametronics or the dangers of the place, especially when the gang also entered. But she tries and helps out. When Abby goes to the place. The police officer is set out to destroy her dad's work. The Anamametronics soon realise what he's done, and now they are all in.\n\nThe Ghost kids, were in Mike's dreams, consistently when he was working at Freddy Fazbears work place. Which were then telling him about his missing brother. That was a cool and interesting direction to go.\n\nSo overall, with a bit of work, the film could of been great and something special. But I'd recommend this to the die hard fans of the popular game series."

The only good thing here were the special effects and the practical effects. Even the effects were not that good enough, and most of the monsters did not even have kills, the most kills were by the cupcake animatronic, the animatronics were made good i just do not understand why their eyes were yellow, and the timeline is just wrong by a lot of things. This movie did not stick with me it did have one memorable thing, when the blonde woman in the movie was stabbed in the right side, and you can see the stabbing wound in the left side and it magically appears on the right side again and she is holding her wound."

The laughable monsters are so ridiculous looking that I couldn't stop laughing. Josh is no leading man material and to see his boring countenance nearly the whole movie is unbearable. How this made so much money opening weekend is mystifying but hey I watched tons of awful movies when I was a teenager myself. There are no scares, no good effects; certainly no good deaths. I expect a precipitous drop next week in the box office. Awful awful awful."

That's a good level of scare, just enough he enjoyed it, not so much he couldn't watch it.\n\nIt also was entertaining enough we were able to watch it as a family. Matthew Lillard for the parents, Josh Hutchinson for the kids.\n\nVisually the movie was flawless. & All your favorite bits were in the movie! We got to watch this the day before it came out on theaters due to streaming it on Peacock which was also really nice.\n\nOverall the entire family was impressed & hoping for a sequel that's just as good!"

Any movie released for Halloween is bound to have a silly element, and this one sure did. Definitely nothing that's going to receive any Oscar nods. If you can accept it as a ridiculous idea, then you'll have fun. I will give it props for using actual animatronics instead of CGI."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie is not the same as the game we played as child. The jumpscare, horror, psychological horror was the reasons why the game was so successful. And that just wasn't in the movie at all, the plot was full chaos, cast wasn't good. While it's important to remember that opinions on movies can be highly subjective, some viewers and critics have expressed their disappointment with the \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" (FNAF) movie for several reasons. It's worth noting that the FNAF movie was in development at the time of my last knowledge update in January 2022, and the final product may have evolved since then. With that in mind, here are some reasons why some people might have considered the FNAF movie to be less than satisfying:\n\nFirstly, the adaptation from video games to film can be a challenging endeavor. The FNAF games are known for their suspenseful and immersive gameplay, and translating this tension to a movie format is no easy task. Some fans of the games might have been disappointed if they felt that the movie failed to capture the same level of suspense and fear that the games provided.\n\nSecondly, the characters and lore of the FNAF series are complex and deep, with a rich backstory that has been developed over multiple game installments. Adapting this lore into a two-hour movie can be tricky, and there's the risk of oversimplification or leaving out essential details that fans love. Some critics of the FNAF movie might argue that it didn't do justice to the complexity of the game's narrative.\n\nThirdly, casting and character portrayal can be a contentious issue in any adaptation. If fans had particular expectations for how the characters should look and act, any deviation from these expectations could lead to disappointment. It's not uncommon for fans of a franchise to have strong attachments to their favorite characters, and any perceived misrepresentation can be a source of frustration.\n\nFourthly, the tone of the FNAF movie is essential. The games have a unique blend of horror and dark humor, and striking the right balance in a movie adaptation can be challenging. If the movie leaned too heavily in one direction, it might have alienated some fans who were hoping for a different tone.\n\nFifthly, the pacing and structure of the movie can be problematic. Video games and movies are different mediums, and what works in one might not work in the other. Some viewers might have found the pacing of the FNAF movie to be uneven or felt that it didn't maintain their interest throughout its duration.\n\nLastly, it's essential to acknowledge that some people's expectations for the FNAF movie might have been unreasonably high. The FNAF franchise has a dedicated and passionate fan base, and sometimes, high expectations can lead to disappointment no matter how well a movie is executed.\n\nIn conclusion, while the reasons mentioned above represent some of the potential issues viewers and critics might have had with the FNAF movie, it's important to remember that opinions on films are subjective. What one person considers a disappointment, another might find enjoyable. The success of any movie, especially one based on a beloved franchise like FNAF, depends on various factors, and it's possible that some viewers were left unsatisfied for the reasons mentioned above or others. However, it's essential to keep in mind that the movie industry is constantly evolving, and the FNAF movie may have undergone changes and improvements since my last update in January 2022."

So this movie should be right up my ally right? Well not in this case. The movie focuses on hitting that feature film length so much that you get a jumbled story with so much going on that the movie ends up just leaving you behind. Oh and Animatronics we're great for the 5 minutes they were on screen.\n\nThe characters are not interesting at all and that's a shame because we are stuck following the main character Mike through un interesting repetitive dream sequences that lead to nothing. The others acted in such an non human way, it throws you out of the illusion.\n\nThis movie had a story already written out that scared so many people already, why they didn't just stick to that and flesh out the already told story is beyond me. They need to tone it down and stick to what they already have if they plan on doing anything else with the franchise."

Since this is a spoiler free review let's just say there are some animatronic fight scenes, I won't say who but one of them have not been in the trailers a small but important character. Now the cameos I will be saying the names of who appears in the movie if you want to be surprised skip this part. Game Theory, Dawko, cory Kenison, Markiplier, and more!!! Now golden Freddy turns out to be familiar with William Afton. Movie got a 7/10 for me."

Small jokes are made tongue-in-cheek and we laugh at some common painful experiences we've all had, but overall, it missed the vibe of the game. Another version did a better job of referring to the game and its elements while translating the campy element of the game into campy movie elements. It may have been simpler, but it was closer to the games.. Honestly this movie was more like Doctor Sleep. I'll probably rewatch the Willie's Wonderland movie to get the taste of this one out of my mind."

Cheese\" with giant animatronic creatures and a security guard who has to avoid being caught by said homicidal monsters.\n\nThe movie version also has plenty of jump scares, but it also has heart.\n\nThe security guard \"Mike's\" (Josh Hutcherson) life is not two dimensional instead it's fleshed out with vivid dreams and flashbacks to an event that shaped his life and altered it for him and his younger sister \"Abby\" (Piper Rubio) forever.\n\nThis event causes him to have anger management issues and a need for prescription sleeping medication.\n\nIronically when they press the \"Showtime\" button at Freddy's the Jim Henson Creatures come to life playing the lesser know hit by the Romantics \"Talking In Your Sleep\" (a classic 80's hit).\n\nEnter stage left 80's Bratpacker Mary Stuart Masterson (\"Some Kind of Wonderful\") as cruel, smelling of cigarettes Aunt Jane who wants custody of Mike's sister (probably for cigarette money) Watch out for: Matthew Lillard (\"Scooby Doo\") as \"Steve Raglan\" proving there are no small roles.\n\nElizabeth Lail (\"You\" on Netflix) is the kind Cop \"Vanessa\" with her own issues to deal with.\n\nYou don't have to know or even have played the video game phenomenon as this is a stand alone movie.\n\nWhat does disturb me is how many primary school children have played every horrific game in the series, yet somehow this movie littered with mutilated bodies, horror and violence is only rated M.\n\nWithout doubt this is the best project the Blumhouse horror factory (a modern day Hammer Films) has put their stamp on in years.\n\nThanks to good actors, script, editing, direction etc it works.\n\nQuestion is can you survive five nights at Freddy Fazbears Pizza or will you be pining for Nebraska?"

Chuck in the mix of the taxi driver comedy scenes and the big giant robot getting in a cab and it was like what?! I can kind of get younger fans feeling some nostalgia but it was just dull for an apparent scary movie. The story was all over the place, some of which made no sense. Some reviews suggest tension or edge of your seat stuff, my advice to them people, never watch the ring or the grudge, you'll never sleep with the lights off again. However I will be fair some of the actors tried, not all but some. I genuinely think this movie could have been a lot better but based on some of the positive reviews, it was solely created for the true fans. If you really want to watch or have been conned by the trailer, I would advise to maybe rent on a stream platform when available."

I do have some small complaints though, one of the complaints I have is I hoped to see more of William Afton in the movie but besides that I'm very happy with what we received from this movie. I actually understand why critics rated this movie low, and that reason is that they aren't fans of the franchise. If you have always been a fan of this franchise then you will likely love this movie, overall I'm super excited to see the second movie when it releases!"

It seems like the only positive reviews are coming from prior fans of the game series who hold a bias, but for the average viewer who's just wanting to watch a good film this is a fail. The pacing in the movie is very jarring, and there is also far too much dialogue and not enough action. The plot is a convoluted mess and the final showdown was a huge let down. The run time of the film is rather long yet it still wasn't able to make any sense of the story. Completely forgettable and generic."

But what holds your attention till the end of the movie is the story of the security gaurd Mike and his sister Abby and mystery of his brother Garrett. You start liking the main characters which makes you care for them. The climax could've been better. Overall its a one-time watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "So I know the basic premise of FNAF but I have never looked up into the whole lore that there apparently is. So if there are any scenes in this movie that are based on this lore I didn't recognize them and so I can't give the movie credit for that. My rating is based on my very little knowledge of that basic FNAF game.\n\nAt first I was really skeptical because the movie starts with an eye rolling scene where our protagonist beats up a man because he thinks that a young boy is being kidnapped and I immediately knew that it was the guy's son and this will play a role in the protagonists backstory. Talking about the backstory I am tired of the trope that a character has lived through something heartbreaking or feels guilt for something that he did. I don't know if there is any similar things in FNAF, but if there isn't then I don't know why they dragged this generic plot into this actually pretty unique movie.\n\nHowever I actually kind of enjoyed the movie overall and I think Mike's character is portrait really well by Josh Hutcherson. You empathize with him and even feel sorry for the situation he is in about his younger sister Abby with his aunt. I also really enjoyed the character of Vanessa and seeing Matthew Lillard in this was a pleasure as well. Also the animatronics look really good and the whole set was really true to detail and I think that fans will love that. There are some cheap jump scares but if there's one movie who is allowed to do that, then it's a movie about FNAF I guess.\n\nI think the movie ended up decent and was enjoyable for a one time watch but on the other hand I think with this unique setup they could have made so much more and the movie ended up not being able to stand out enough to be remembered as a classic.

Why this is a 15 certificate baffles me although there is one stabbing incident in it, so. Halfway through the movie I assumed I'd misunderstood not having read much about it and it was actually meant to be a horror spoof because it wasn't scary for on nanosecond. I know it's based on a popular video game so maybe it's aimed at fans of that, but I'm struggling to think of a worse movie I've seen in recent years. I think it has to be up there in the top 10 worst films I've ever seen. When I see movies as bad as this I can't help wondering what the cast thought when they saw the finished movie. Horrified?"

I won't say what happened in order to avoid spoilers but there is an intere scene that left me screaming due to it being so stupid. I was excepting along with everyone a horror movie with belovable IP and an amazingly creepy atmosphere which the games themselves achieve perfectly.it shouldn't even be classified as horror and the gore itself is very limited and mostly off screen. The only reason it is a 6/10 is because it was fun being in the movie theater with people that had such a big passion for the same things since mostly fans of the franchise attented at least on premiere day and some scenes were pretty funny. The movie is better described as mediocre comedy than horro."

The sound design was kinda bad in my opinion, but something that I actually really liked was the lighting. The scenes felt super empty and lifeless, like the places around them weren't real, and even in scenes with extras it felt dull. The movie just fell flat.

I have to surmise that the games involve sneaking around the diner while avoiding the menacing glare of the animatronics?\n\nTo be fair most studios who try to adapt what makes computer games so successful onto the screen fail. I'm thinking of you Street Fighter 2, The Last of Us, Super Mario Brothers, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, *The Witcher, Resident Evil - the problem is that playing a game is incredibly immersive, as should be watching a film, and video games have much, much more license to take their time in getting you to bond with the character and story you're telling.\n\nI digress, massively. Basically, FNaF's is slow, boring, predictable. You do not spend any time with the monsters (hardly) and I get the feeling the storytellers couldn't decide if we, the audience, were supposed to sympathise with them, or fear them."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the 9-year wait for the FNAF movie, the reviews are in, the critics are mad, and the fans are disappointed, but before you go cancel your tickets to the movie, I will go through the positives. Matthew Lillard was great as William Afton, and the acting was great. The animatronics looked cool and accurate for the games, and the movie was very fun. Overall, it is great to watch if you are a FNAF fan, but for me, I had problems with it. The movie always talks down to its audience, even though they will dissect anything to understand. And I had so much story, but there was no conclusion to it, and it all amounted to nothing. But while the animatronics were cool, they felt too robotic, and it missed the uncanny valley part that made it scary. So now that we have all that out of the way, it's time for me to tell you how Blumhouse can learn from their mistakes, but first let me tell you how the second FNAF movie should start. After William afton was dragged away and left to die he turns his head to a tray of purple fluid trapped in a glass vile he reaches his hand out to grab the mysterious purple fluid and he injects it into himself then he cracks out a laugh before crack he grabs his neck gasping for air while the spring lock closes in on his neck then the spring locks start to close in on more areas and then he falls to the floor and blood starts to stain the suit he was in before he finally falls on the floor and dies then the animatronics walk back to the positions they were in with each step becoming more human like and unpredictable than before then they blink and what was one robotic eyes became a void with a white dot in the middle of it showing how the ghost kids have taken full control of the animatronics and now there lives are like the mysterious purple fluid trapped in a small jar and locked away from the real world meanwhile a new guy with the name of Jeremy Fitzgerald ended up in the hospital with bandages around his head but he constantly kept getting flashbacks of him trying to stop the animatronics but there main weakness didn't work on it that time a then he starred at the bright speck left over in the dark void in cupcake and Chickas eyes before cupcake launched at him and biting him damaging his frontal lobe then Michael afton gets introduced and after accidentally being the cause of the death of his younger brother he needs seeks to find redemption for his brother. But with William Afton out of the picture, Henery Emily interviewed Michael Afton, and he got the job. Now, Mike Schmidt Jeremy Fitzgerald and Michael Afton have to find a way to stop the animatronics while also uncovering the mysteries behind Freddy Fazzbear's pizzaria's Michael Afton tries to survive the next 5 nights at Freddy's. And that is how I think the FNAF 2 movie could improve on its predecessor."

As far as the fans are concerned this landfill is even worse than that. F- for effort that's for sure. Not only that, but I have my doubts that Scott was even involved. This seemed like MatPat (whom Scott has said he hates, and yet for some reason put an obligatory MatPat cameo in this) had more involvement with the film instead of Scott. It's literally just based on MatPat's crack pipe dreams, and nothing connects it to Five Nights At Freddy's other than the name of the film. Somehow the Banana Splits film passes more like a FNAF film than this. I know that 95% of Jason Blum's films go in the red financially, and are considered rotten...

I think he got a raw deal with being the partner no one wanted for Katniss in the Hunger Games, and for the creators of that franchise using him to a bare minimum and only to make him act the part of 'the girl'. You KNOW exactly what I'm speaking of; so sue me. He gets a pass here.\n\nPlus, if you understand the basics of the FNAF franchise, it pretty much covers what it needs to. Hutcherson plays the clueless, beat-down, life-has-it-out-for-him, semi-dazed brother with a good heart who really tries, very well.\n\nA couple of the \"bads\" might as well be wearing signs from the very beginning especially because it's FNAF, so there is little to no suspense in that area, but it's somewhat interesting and entertaining, which is more than you can say for a LOT of films out now. The story itself is different or at least not overdone, so that's another plus. Who knows, in a few years it may actually become a cult classic. For now, well, even my 7 won't allow me to FULLY recommend it. NOT that it's BAD, but watch it to say you did, because you're a FNAF fan and to support those involved, or because you have nothing better to do (the list of things to-do may surprise you), or for the animatronics which are pretty great, or because you like stories that are just a tad off the beaten path, but don't expect it to be a 10-Star project.\n\n5.5 Stars + 1.5 Stars for Hutcherson :D."

        "review_detailed_main": "Written by Ian Chandler - November 2, 2023\n\nAlmost a decade after the first \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" video-game won the attention of the internet, Scott Cawthon finally adapts his beloved horror franchise into a motion picture. Fantasy and fun come to life with its impressive practical effects and even more impressive budget. Even so, the film gets lost when translated from its spooky, but tween friendly games. It, most fatally, completely forgets its most famous trademarks: suspense and jump scares. It should not be expected to be a work of art, but at the very least, the screenplay should not leave all of the heavy-lifting to the production team.\n\nAs mentioned previously, those who produced the visual aspects of \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" are exceptional on ensuring that the pizzeria is how a fan would imagine it. It's dark, dusty, but also colorful. The technology in the abandoned pizzeria is appropriately dated. Additionally, in an industry so reliant on the use of CGI, it was refreshing to see Freddy and his pals as real animatronics. So much love and care were put into the world Scott Cawthon created that it stings a bit more that the film's other elements are as empty as an animatronics' endoskeleton.\n\nThe plot is not as bad as it could have been, but it still never feels polished, nor fresh. It features an upsetting story about a sad protagonist, with tragedies brought up throughout. It is accurate in many ways to the plot of the third game; unfortunately, plot points are brought up repeatably without much progression in order to satisfy the nearly two-hour runtime. When plot elements demand for more substance, they are sidelined for the recurring objective put in place, resulting in an abrupt ending overall and a lack of resolution for certain parts that happen near the end. Characters during the first two acts are serviceable with some good acting, most notably from Josh Hutcherson. When the second act starts to close, the dialogue becomes increasingly wooden and the actors try their best to combat the lackluster script by conveying emotion in the tired phrases given to them.\n\nDespite the forgettable plot and uneven characters, a horror film can usually stand on two feet if it provides what they promise: suspense. This, strangely, is where the movie is at its weakest. There is not a second where one's heartrate rises, nor is there a moment to cling on to the seat in fear. The animatronics, furthermore, are too expressive compared to their video-game counterparts; this results in impressive facial movements, but a less impressive method of intimidation. Part of what made the games creepy was their lack of visual movement and their corpse-like faces. The violent sequences, however, are creative, given the fact it is appropriately aimed at younger teenagers. Gore is obscured with clever shadows, impacts are reasonably cut at the last second to not only censor, but also to keep it from appearing cheesy. When it does not remember to cut at the right time, the result is usually very silly; which could possibly be the point when regarding its 1980s theme.\n\n\"Five Nights at Freddy's,\" almost seems purposeful in its lack of creepiness as tonal inconsistencies emerge as an enormous problem. About halfway in, the film turns from a slightly unsettling adventure into a tone reminiscent of a bubbly montage found in many Chuck-e-Cheese home videos. It's inorganic, and any suggestion of a spine-chilling blockbuster evaporates at this point. It almost suggests that multiple drafts of the film were sloppily merged together. It attempts to tread back to perilous moments later on, but interest in the unfinished plot is alarmingly small by the time it gets there.\n\nWith all of that said, \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" is better than any movie about a point-and-click game has any right to be. It is simply bothersome that it could have been drastically more enjoyable had the plot added more depth and the atmosphere remain similar to its source material. It is about guaranteed that the film will receive an endless supply of sequels, with a spark of hope that it only goes up from here. This first entry, however, does not make a good impression for the franchise going forward. If the screenwriter were to be changed for a more experienced one, improvements could be of large proportions.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's - 56/100\n\n\"Five Nights at Freddy's\" may have the fantasy going for it, but the removal of scares and fun prevent it from truly coming to life."

He deserved that role as 1# dilf, and he played it well. And i just LOVED the 10 minute steam room scene with mike and william, it truly was an amazing experience. As far as other movies, they should have Matthew return for the role of springtrap. Anyway it was the best movie ever ong ong fr fr."

I mean a tad boring, if the acting felt more real and raw then I'd probably be more into it. But a lot of the acting was so off-putting to me. Some of the characters were randomly thrown in too which felt out of place.\n\nAtmosphere and the animatronics were the best part of the film, everything else was definitely mediocre."

If you think the story went down hill after pizzeria simulator you won't like this movie. Some people say this movie is for the fans but my friend and I were so beyond upset after leaving the theater because if this is what fans like I severely worry about their judgement in other parts of life if they can rave over a lack of story, 8 plots that go nowhere and a complete betrayal to everything the first games were."

It felt like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment. While I'm intrigued by the idea of a new film exploring this concept, I have a strong feeling that the one I initially enjoyed with Nicholas Cage is the superior one. His performance added an extra layer of eccentricity and charm to the movie, making it an unforgettable experience. If \"Five Nights At Freddy's\" wants to stand out, it will have some big shoes to fill."

        "review_detailed_main": "The fact that a FNAF movie even happened is just amazing on its own. I am sure lots of people just wanted something to come out just to have the FNAF name out there (they waited 8 years). It is very cool that it happened but due to a very inexperienced director and Scott Cawthon and others not having much experience in working on movies, it couldn't reach it's full potential.\n\nThe FNAF franchise has so much great lore and material but a lot of it wasn't used. I'll start with the positives: the animatronics/puppets look fantastic, Jim Henson's team did an amazing job on them. They look about as true to the games as you can get. The cameos of certain people influential to this franchise were very nice to see and some parts were pretty funny. Josh Hutcherson did well as Mike and the guy playing Yellow Bunny (can't remember his name at the moment, he played Shaggy in the Scooby-Doo movies) was also good. The cons of this movie are really all based on the dialogue, writing, editing and directing. Some of the scenes are extremely awkward and even the best actors can't do much with such bad dialogue like there was in this movie. There are some shots that cut away too quickly. Lots of plot holes and sudden shifts in mood and setting that don't make much sense. We don't really get to take our time with the characters and understand them. I know this is supposed to be a simple movie and not a deep one but we should have some sense of their personalities than what was provided. The animatronics weren't as scary as they could have been and they are very scary in the games. The movie just can't decide if it's actually a horror movie or not at times. Overall, this movie had a lot of potential but it just couldn't reach it fully."

As it has been in the games and in the books.\n\nI might add that if someone who came to see it solely based on the games might not know or forget what from the animatronics came to life, they might think the movie was too boring or not scary enough on some parts.\n\nAnimation, music, animatronics and the ambience was made really well and my exitement stayed all the way to the credits and a bit after it.\n\nIt was such a pleasure to see my childhood horrors on the screen and \"alive\".\n\nI cant wait to see the rest!"

I would have loved there to be a scene where we actually see Mike Schmidt deal with the animatronics in the same way you would in the game for at least one night. It would've also been great to see a power outage scene just before the clock hits 6. It would've made for a great suspenseful moment. Having phone guy in the first night would've also been great, as some of the most iconic lines from the franchise come from that (obviously). I feel like the movie doesn't know whether or not it wants to be a horror film or a thriller either.\n\nActors were all great choices. I think the main two characters were great.\n\nWith that being said, just like the FNAF games, it could probably give kids a good scare and be a good introduction to the horror genre. The gore in it is minuscule, although some scenes might still make kids uneasy. This is also a really fun film to watch with friends who love the franchise and grew up with it.\n\nAlthough I have gripes, I would still likely pay money to see a FNAF movie 2, lol."

Instead they got the really fun and simple story on the movie.\n\nAbout the movie in my opinion, is still really great to watch and you don't even need to know the lore, the plot of the game to understanding this movie. The story are really simple with some comedy that some of the joke are made me laugh a little and also the characterization of the antagonist really great. But the downside of the antagonist is not enough of screentime, just like another thriller movie that the antagonist first are friendly, and then in the last they're have some menacing story why they're becoming evil and do menace thing's and then wanted to killed the protagonist but can't, because of the power of friendship or even the power of hope i guess???\n\nBut on top of that still fun watched."

I thought it was amazing, with a title like FNAF production produced the best result for the fans of the series. This movie has no intention of being an masterpiece but that being said it isn't poorly made, it's high quality and you can tell that a lot of work was put into every scene but it was made for the fans.\n\nI really liked this movie because FNAF has been around for a while, when I was younger like everyone else, I loved FNAF I thought it was so cool and it still is. FNAF is for the younger people but there's also older people who really enjoy it too so it's really for everybody.\n\nWhen I watched this movie in theaters the entire theater was filled with teenagers and it felt like a really friendly environment because everyone there loves FNAF. In fact when the movie ended the whole theater started clapping even though it wasn't the best movie everybody in there was satisfied with what they saw. Audience reactions to the cameos were cool too.\n\nAt the end of the day I think I was glad that the movie didn't try too hard to be something it wasn't and instead stuck to what the series embodied in a community sense. It was something people liked."

Like myself, I have just recently turned into an adult and I am not a film critic, but Jesus was this flop of an adaptation, considering I had been playing FNAF games since their release, versus kids fanning over the cringe worthy lore (mixing lore with cringe memes); Not even considering they were just toddlers at the time, and most fans were around 10 years old, even though those kids probably only recently heard about it (one or two years ago).\n\nExample: Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach (But Vanessa) it was funny at first, but quickly got cringe. The moral of the story is don't make a movie about a game, unless it's authentic and enjoyable to watch without kids screaming over the movie on how the film was \"so good\"! ..."

That's what makes FNAF and its lore so interesting, it's mystery and subtle details about what happened in the pizzeria, that fear of unknown. Instead, we got everything spoonfed to us halfway through and it completely ruined this movie. It feels like it was purely made for children rather than being an actually accurate movie to the games."

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that wants to watch a \"scary\", \"gorey\" movie. The best I can describe this is that it's a movie that you watch for fun and then forget about it instantly. Actually, as weird as this sounds, I'd like to see a sequel. Maybe a sequel could fix everything and not only explain the lore further but also add some more scary scenes.

On one side, you have a cast of pretty cool and terrifying characters, in a location that's familiar to many adults and with a pretty gruesome backstory. But on the other side, you have the fans and audience of said cast, location and backstory mostly consisting of youths. What do you then do as a director, or a script writer? Well you compromise.\n\nI have no doubt this movie would be pretty good, if not great, if it had truly committed to its adult audience, but It was never gonna do that and thus, this movie was never going to be any good. I went in knowing this, and I was still baffled by how terrible the story was.\n\nThe production quality in regards to the set and the animatronics though were through the roof, and that alone definitely made the movie worth the watch. So if you're solely into that kind of stuff, and are able to ignore the plot, I definitely recommend this movie to you."

When he risks losing custody of Abby to his Aunt, Jane, he takes the first job that comes along - offered to him by job counselor Steve Raglan. (Raglan being the job counselor and the later reveal about his character was a bit too convenient.)\n\nMike starts working as a security officer at a rundown pizzeria called Freddy's. No longer in use, the building is subjected to constant break-ins, and the owner - apparently having sentimental value over the pizzeria - hires a security officer to watch the place. It is a very creepy place and makes for a scary setting.\n\nHoping to prove Mike incompetent so she can gain custody of Abby, Jane hires juveniles to break into Freddy's and trash the place. However, when they break in, they encounter murderous animatronics that came to life.\n\nMike has a tragic back story: when he was twelve years old, his little brother was taken, and never found. His back story and the present intertwines , which can be very confusing at times. He also has dreams about the past and its not always clear when he has nightmares or memories.\n\nThe film offers effective jump scares and a few twists in the mix as well. I firmly believed this was going to be just another slasher movie, but it has a lot more substance. The unique and creepy antagonists are bound to give a younger audience nightmares - what with those glowing yellow eyes! For me, this definitely will go down as a memorable watch."

Everything that was scary in the game was just taken away. The whole vibe, music and sounds. It was just a generic horror movie, very predictable.

One of the better elements here is the overall setup in place that puts everything in motion with his employment at the location. The entire first half with the deadbeat loser background beaten into this setup, the desire to keep his sister out of the diabolical aunt and her plans to bring the girl to live with her instead of the brother which spurns his later desire to take the job to help her all comes along together nicely. As the story goes along, the growing need to stay at the facility with how it helps him try to come to terms with the dreams that are the sole reason for his troubled life to this point becomes quite fun and generates quite a lot of depth to the kind of story presented here. This one also manages to come off quite well with its technical qualities presented pretty much throughout the film. The setup of the facility is pretty fun and looks nice with the abandoned layout and design which is the same perfectly slick, glossy feel appropriate for this kind of mainstream film. There's also a lot to like with the animatronics at play which look distinctive and highly expressive for what they are, coming into play well with the few scenes of the homicidal robots going crazy including the attack on the trespassers or the friendly interactions with the sister that shows their varying nature. It's all fine enough to give the film a lot of likable factors to hold it up over its flaws. This one does have some pretty big issues that bring it down. The biggest issue to be had here is the films' incessantly overlong and unnecessary setup that provides no real enjoyment or even connection to the franchise lore. The decision to go as deep as it does on the backstory of the security guard including the incident with his brother and the inability to figure out what happened then, the struggles with raising his sister alone despite the constant intrusions of the aunt to take her away and his struggles with finding a job are just not that interesting to see play out. It's not the kind of material that's warranted in this kind of film where it's supposedly about sentient animatronic robots going berserk in a run-down pizzeria. That indeed leads into the other factor with this one where it's nearly devoid of the kind of material usually warranted in this type of setup. With the aforementioned backstory already in play, the need to keep playing out each of these scenarios in detail trying to figure out the connections to everything keeps this from really unleashing the kind of mayhem expected here. The inability to let the killer animatronics go crazy and stalk a bunch of intruders inside the location is a big thing here since that's the main reason to enjoy this one and not doing that does hurt this one quite a bit for those expecting something similar to the chosen franchise.\n\nRated PG-13: Violence, Language, and children-in-jeopardy."

At its core it is cheesy horror that is chock full of cliches and tropes that would understandably make the average viewer groan at the sheer absurdity of what they're watching, but for fans of the FNAF franchise that had been looking forward to this movie since the circulation of rumors dating back to the very first game, I think this movie is a great bit of fun, especially for lore fans like myself. This movie has an insane cast of cameos and the soundtrack was hit right on the money. For some reason the use of \"Talking in Your Sleep\" by The Romantics fit beautifully with the animatronics. On that subject, the animatronics look almost flawless. They were extremely well done and I'm glad that this movie was at least done some justice for fans of the franchise, even if it isn't the average viewers cup of tea."

It's incredibly monotonous having to watch the same thing being told over and over. I guess they say around and said what can we take from every movie ever and throw it together in a poor fashion. I gave it 3 stars for the cinematography and the special effects. Don't waste your time, you've seen this before."

        "review_detailed_main": "But it still wasnt anything too special, unfortunately. To be fair the game does have some good preformances (even from the child actor who played abby) and theres some interesting cinematography, but thats pretty much it. The characters seem to just accept the unusual nature of the events that happen to them without really questioning anything. They just kinda accept it and treat it as the most normal thing in the world. Theres also a completely pointless side plot about abbys aunt trying to take custody of her so that she can get free child support cheques or something that never really equates to anything. They could have just cut that part out and the movie would be mostly unaffected. At the very least i was kinda hoping that the movie would expand upon the FNAF lore and progress the story of it, but from what i can tell im pretty sure this movie wants to disconnect itself from the games and be its own story it was difinitely a movie that FELT like fnaf, it had a lot of references and cameos and stuff, but overall the movie just fell a little flat in the end."

Obviously with a -R or +18 advice, it could have been a masterpiece. Instead the movie is more oriented to scare Tik Tok generations.\n\nLast, the cast is just Ok. I didn't know anyone before the film and after it I'm going to forget all of them. A shame.\n\nSo, overall a missed opportunity to create something great, fantastic and scary. Definitely , I can't recommend to horror fans, because if there's no blood, there's no crime. Happy Halloween."

Bonnie is a close second. Seriously though if you want a good horror movie to watch with your friends, this is the one for fans and non fans alike.

        "review_detailed_main": "My wife and I recently watched Five Nights at Freddy's (2023) on Peacock this evening. The storyline centers around an older brother striving to provide for his younger sister, whom his aunt intends to adopt. He accepts a job at an abandoned establishment reminiscent of Chuck E. Cheese, only to discover that the animatronics within are far more alive than they initially seem.\n\nDirected by Emma Tammi (The Wind), the film features a cast that includes Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games), Matthew Lillard (Scream), Elizabeth Dean Lail (You), Piper Rubio (Unstable), and Mary Stuart Masterson (The Stepford Wives).\n\nThis movie possesses a wealth of potential with a captivating concept, provocative settings, a strong cast, and intriguing subplots. It had all the elements necessary for a potential masterpiece but falls short of expectations. The kill scenes are disappointingly lackluster, starting from the opening credits, which could have set a thrilling tone but did not deliver. There's a distinct absence of gore, visual depictions of killings, blood splatter, or any such elements. The film's PG-13 rating is a clear limitation. It's a missed opportunity, as the atmosphere is well-crafted, and the cast delivers stellar 10/10 performances. Lillard is a perfect fit for his role, and Masterson makes for an excellent villain. Hutcherson's performance is compelling, portraying an authentic big brother dealing with inner turmoil. The ending reveal adds to the film's intrigue. However, the subpar kill scenes remain a glaring flaw.\n\nIn conclusion, Five Nights at Freddy's had the potential for greatness had it pushed the envelope and embraced an R-rating for a more intense horror experience. Instead, it caters to a middle school audience. I would give it a 4/10 rating, but I still recommend watching it at least once."

Acting is fine so far but for the animatronics costumes with cast inside, it is difficult for them to act like an animatronics.

I recommend for fans you would have an amazing time totally worth the wait a lot of people hate on this movie over lore and saying it's all over the place and I'd say there wrong they obviously didn't tell u the exact lore but they showed you enough to understand it the animatronics where done well I feel like it wasn't scary but some parts actually got me and the ending was honestly really good it's not to lore accurate neither is is not lore accurate at all it's just a true gift to the fnaf fans sorry for the drag on sentence."

With that said it drags and drags to get anywhere. When it doesn't want to focus on the video game related content it's boring. If you don't know the games you'll be scratching your head being lost. I was entertained by it but I do know if I wasn't a fan I would of not been as invested. The cast in the film are alright. The animatronics themselves look amazing. Though with that said there are a few scenes in the film that are very silly and over the top. Not scary at all and feels like filler scenes. I do agree with a few other reviews it does feel like a comedy / light hearted when it's supposed to be Dark / Scary. Now when the film gets to the climax it does feel like a very good end and sets up for future films. Also extra bonus point was for a lot of the FNAF's community (YouTube / Twitch Streamers) being placed around the film won't spoil whose in but if you know where to look you'll love the nods. In the end if your Fan I highly recommend it if not then Try it but don't expect a lot from it."

You might agree if one or more of the following are true: (1) You've played the video game. (2) You enjoy very tame/light horror. (3) You've enjoyed this new trend of \"family horror\" like M3gan (4 stars).\n\nNone of those are true for me. I am confident that horror fiends will find it severely underwhelming. This is the kind of movie you might show to a 10-year-old who wants to get into horror movies. Just like with M3gan, the crowd was very young and there were even children.\n\nIt's severely limited by the cowardly PG-13 rating. But I've liked some PG-13 horror movies, like Insidious. This one just isn't even a tiny bit scary. It didn't make me jump. The \"scary\" scenes amount to about 8% of this movie. The rest is fairly slow and boring.\n\nTo make it worse, this movie makes no sense. You have to completely turn your brain off and not question anything. Otherwise the complete lack of logic and aimlessness of the story becomes apparent.\n\nIt also has some very questionable moments and little things that made it feel off. One small example, someone uses fingers so wipe the blood off a knife, a move commonly seen by Ghostface in the Scream movies. The problem is, there's zero blood on the knife.\n\nThis reminds me of a recent streaming movie with a very similar premise called Willy's Wonderland starring the great Nick Cage. That one didn't hold back, but it was a much lower quality streaming movie than this theatrically released one. I ended up giving it the same score.\n\nI didn't hate this movie. It's pretty funny and whimsical. I just really wish it was better and went all out. And I couldn't help but feel befuddled as the rest of my crowd kept going crazy at certain parts. I was sadly jealous.\n\n(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/26/2023)"

The atmosphere in my cinema was rowdy, half of the people going to see the film because of the game and the other half as a joke. The film overall had a weak plot, the acting was abismal and it was a hard watch without some jokes in between. That said though, the graphics were great and it will please those who are fans of the game, there are some special apperances and im sure that long fans of the film will appreciate it. My main takeaways are really: 1. Definitely watch if you are a big fan of FNAF, there are special appearances and it will fill you with interesting content 2. If you dont know anything about FNAF, DONT GO! If you want to see a good movie go to Killers of the Flower Moon instead, unless you enjoy sub par horror (which wasnt all too scary) I wouldnt go!\n\nThat said, if you enjoy fnaf then eat your heart out with this one."

Sure, there are a couple of jumps cares here and there, but they're pretty predictable. I'm assuming it's because they were going for a more kid friendly vibe. But, other than that little gripe, the movie was pretty good. Solid plot, kinda a don't think about it too much one where it's just meant to be fun. I'd say this is a good Halloween watch that the whole family can enjoy, but just be careful with the LITTLE ones, I'd say probably kids around 10 can handle it."

Still I went into it with hope, and when I saw news of the first to watch it hating it I excused it, many people aren't fans of the games so maybe they just didn't know enough about them to thoroughly enjoy it as I hopped I would. Went in exsited, found myself wishing the movie would just end not even half way through, a major disappointment, the film had no atmosphere, the gore was non existent, the horror franchise I grew up on was adapted into a movie I would more describe a comedy, no scares what so ever, I predicted every single twist and reveal, I even predicted the lines the characters would say before they even said it. I grew up imagining getting springlocked as a horrific brutal and gory endeavour only to find it so tame and bland i nearly walked out of the theatre, the actors did a fine job but nothing outstanding, I wish Matthew lilard went full stu maucher with the \"I always come back\" line. I found the story to be the most boring strung together peice of work, to the point I was thinking of ways I would have changed the movie to make it better and found not one element of this \"movie\" to make the cut, so disappointed im genuinely sad as I hoped this would be a fantastic film full of fun jumpscares and gore, only to stumble upon the worst film of the year, possibly even the worst film I've seen that's come out since I was born, not to be dramatic, I was just so let down. I do really hope the fnaf franchise gets another movie that hopefully does it right, as the kids raised on the movie have grown up, they want to see a horror film for them now, not as a gateway horror for the younger kids who may have not even been born when the games came out. We want wall to wall jump scares, brutal gore, scary ambiance, and swearing, no one says \"what the heck\", at least no one respectable. As a huge fan of the franchise I really hope for another movie that may do it better, to mr. Blum ik it may be way more exspensive to do it the way fans want it, but it will pay off in the long run."

It drove away from the games just a little bit, but it was all okay in the end. I loved the Easter Eggs from the games and the books and as well as the guests and false rumors from the games. Like Fetch and the doll from 1:35 AM. I don't know why fans were so picky about the movie. ITS OKAY IF FREDDY IS WEARING GLOVES ON THE SIGN!!! AND WHO CARES ABOUT THE RED EYES?! Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. If Blumhouse actually fixed those complaints, the movie would actually be bad. The red eyes are meant to show emotion. In conclusion, this is a movie for you if you like horror games."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll try and keep this brief and spoiler free as possible but too say this is bad is a understatement, it's a absolute disappointment to any merits of filmmaking\n\nThe \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" movie, based on the popular video game franchise, fails to deliver the scares and excitement one would expect from such a beloved source material.\n\nFrom the get-go, the movie's pacing is completely off, with a slow and tedious build-up that lacks any real tension or intrigue. The audience is left waiting for something interesting to happen, but unfortunately, that moment never comes.\n\nThe characters are underdeveloped and uninteresting, making it difficult to feel any sense of connection or sympathy for their plight. The performances are wooden and lack any real depth, further adding to the movie's overall lack of appeal.\n\nThe special effects and animatronics, which should have been the movie's saving grace, are surprisingly subpar. The animatronics lack the creepiness and realism that made the video game so frightening, instead coming off as cheap and unconvincing.\n\nMoreover, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the video game franchise so popular in the first place. The suspenseful gameplay, the eerie atmosphere, and the intricate backstory are all lost in translation, leaving fans of the franchise disappointed and frustrated.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" movie is a massive letdown. With its lackluster performances, poor special effects, and failure to capture the essence of the source material, this film is not worth your time or money."

        "review_detailed_main": "(Coming from a huge fan of the games) FNAF is a horror game with a very disturbing backstory. The pixelated moment with springtrap in game was a lot scarier than the live action scene, how is that even possible? It felt like a kids movie. Very very disappointing as I have been waiting for a FNAF movie for sooo many years now. After the movie ended, everyone at the cinema just left quietly with no applause, screams of excitement or even a happy face even tho there were a lot of fans. They just made a cliche horror movie with the animatronics: little kid drawing, talking to imaginary friends and nobody believes her etc. The movie was about some family drama not about surviving the night. The security guard was pretty much in no danger and he was sleeping all the nights and dreaming about the kids. There were not even any doors that he would have had to close if they get too close. It was literally a night guard duty job with nothing happening other than bad dreams... Later on he brought his sister there as there was literally no threat there and she wanted to go. There was even a scene where the animatronics were building a chair fort together and being best friends... I had no idea FNAF could be so unscary even tho the animatronics were very well done. In the very end they became dangerous to them but you really couldnt care less if anyone died and the animatronics just werent even a bit scary anymore. They also tried to put some lame jokes around for no reason. Knowing how disturbing, scary and unique the original games are im just wondering why they decided to make it a cliche \"horror\" movie that has been done a million times already. Nothing made sense. They could have made such an awesome movie with the concept of the games like having the guard trying to piece together whats happening, checking the cameras, having to save power and actually surviving... They could have had some scary flashbacks as he is figuring out what happened and showing the horror that the kids witnessed and went through and getting more insane knowing he might suffer the same fate. Could have been such a terrifying horror movie perfect for halloween and for fans but nah... I am extremely sad to leave such a review but its just the truth."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not a fan of FNAF. But I used to play FNAF 1, 2 and 4. So the only thing that makes me watch the movie is nostalgia. But this story left a pleasant impression on me. The film impressed me in many ways. Okay, let me stop rambling here.\n\nPROS The reason I was impressed with this movie was because I thought it was bad. But fun and funny. And I was kind of right (I'll get to that later in this review). But, wrong. I had a fun experience and would love to see it again!\n\nAnother great aspect of this movie is the cinematography; the shots and coloring are effective and the atmosphere really give you the first FNAF game vibe which makes it feels nostalgic.\n\nI can also say that the plot is pretty good; quite confusing. But I'm happy with it.\n\nThen there is acting; I'm not saying the script is good (I'll get to that later in this review). But I can say that the four main actors in this movie (Josh Hutcherson, Piper Rubio, Elizabeth Lai and Matthew Lillard) did a great job conveying the emotions.\n\nEaster egg are amazing in this movie; If you've been a fan for a while, you'll love the Easter egg in this movie.\n\nI wanna say jump scares are the cons. But it feels like it was intentionally made to be goofy. I laughed so many times when jump scares shows up, and I could say it was a pros but still feels like a cons\n\nCONS Script on this movie is so weird; sometimes a scene is pointlessly long! And sometimes they just making a dumb move. There's a time when characters 1 disagrees with the decision of character 2. But character 3 agrees and ignores character 1. Then bad things happened. Later, character 3 is angry with character 1 for causing the accident and decides to threaten character 1. This is really strange to me. There are more problems with scripts.\n\nFinally, demographics. If you've never heard of or aren't a fan of FNAF, don't watch it. I'm serious. If you watch it, you will get bored of watching it. This is the problem, this films is really not for a person who don't know FNAF will like. Most likely, they will be bored watching it.\n\nCONCLUTION I think this movie is a solid 7/10. If you are a fan of FNAF, I recommend seeing this movie in theaters. But if not, just watch it on Peacock."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most people seem upset that the film wasn't darker and rated R, but might I remind you that the source material for this movie (which is based off the first game) barely had gore! The game was also teen so PG-13 would be appropriate! Keep in mind that not every horror movie has to be extremely gruesome, raw and brutal. The Ring is considered one of the best of all time and it barely has blood shed.\n\nThough the cinematography isn't world shattering, the story is lose and has some continuity errors, it's fully made up with the animatronics, gore (which there is a surprising amount for a PG-13 movie),cameos, and set designs! Some rooms are 1 to 1 compared to the ones in the video games and I found myself searching the background for little Easter eggs hidden on set(I was not disappointed). The soundtrack is beautifully made, and perfectly adds suspense to the movie! Many fans going in looking for a movie as scary as Hereditary will be disappointed, this is more creepy than scary itself! There are a few jumpscares that mimic the game perfectly!\n\nThis is a love letter to FNAF. Lovingly crafted for parents to watch while your child screams at the lore implications behind the blanket pattern!"

I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this one, it was just terrible. The director couldn't direct their way out of a toilet. It was that bad.\n\nYou know, I'm a big fan of winning, and this movie, it's a big, fat loser. I don't know what they were thinking when they made it. The animatronic animals, they were supposed to be scary, but they looked like they were made by a bunch of amateurs. It was low energy, folks, low energy.\n\nAnd the story, it was all over the place. I like a good story, a great story, but this one, it was a disaster. I couldn't even follow it, and I'm a very stable genius, you know. It's like they didn't even try.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the Five Nights at Freddy's movie, it was a complete and total disaster. A tremendous waste of time. Don't watch it, folks, don't watch it. You're better off doing something else, something much better. Thank you, thank you very much!"

Despite me not being a fan I still understood some of the Easter eggs from the games, I also loved the sibling dynamic between the main characters Mike and Abby, they are likable characters and you actually care for them, Venessa and and Steve raglan/William Afton, are also good characters.\n\nNegatives: despite me liking this movie it still has its flaws, and one of them is that its not that scary, sure it has its creepy uncomfortable moments, but that rarely happens, the animatronics could have been more aggressive and scarier. And another problem is the cringe annoying YouTube cameos in this movie, they were unfunny useless and dumb scenes that took away from my experience.\n\nBut overall great movie 9/10 stars (written by caseynancarrow)"

The cupcake, the taxi scene and the Vanessa plot twist to name a few.\n\nHowever! As an audience I feel we have gotten too obsessed with bite sized moments and short scenes, acting as though a few inklings of cringe can ruin a two hour experience. 90% of this film is outstanding, visually beautiful and well directed, and I would happily watch it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "The only \"good\" part were the end credits. And it's because of the living tombstone's song.\n\nIf that doesn't tell you about the quality of this movie, I don't know what will.\n\nMy review has to have 500 more characters to post, so I'll just go ahead and break it down for you I guess. In the least spoiler-y way possible.\n\nWhoever made this movie has no idea how to make a horror movie. Who is your audience? Children? Adults? It's not at all clear who this was aimed for and that's probably the biggest reason it fell flat.\n\nHad it been a gory horror movie, maybe it would've been better. But since there are several scenes in the movie where it seems to be pandering to little kids, it feels like the whole movie is a big identity crisis.\n\nAlso the writing just sucks.\n\nAllow me to clarify (I edited this in since I had some time to think about it later and talk to other people about it). A major character died. No funeral, no police investigation. The body wasn't hidden it was in a house, the MAIN CHARACTER'S house. Yet? No mention of it after? Just nothing, like it never happened.\n\nOn top of that, a major plot point is about the main character's brother. We find out who did it, but it was NEVER elaborated on. WHAT happened to him. WHY did it happen. WHERE is his body. Just nothing at all. It's like the writers forgot that was the literal main plot of their story. (It would have made much more sense to make the brother like... one of the animatronics... no idea why they didn't just do that. EASY solution to all of those questions.)\n\nThen there's a scene where the cop is asking the main character about why he didn't lock a door. Instead of him saying \"I did lock the door\" or \"I'm sorry I forgot to lock the door\" he instead replies \"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND\". Wha? Huh? Then he walks the cop to a little creek, sits down, and goes on a giant boring exposition about his brother. HOW is this related to locking a door.\n\nYou wasted 10+ minutes of screen time retelling something we were shown at least 5 times by then, but had no clear response to the question he had been asked. So when you look at the WHOLE situation, the conversation went like this:\n\n\"why didn't you lock the door\" \"you don't understand, my brother is dead and here's how that happened\". DID YOU LOCK THE DOOR OR DID YOU NOT? THIS ANSWERS NOTHING.\n\nOn top of all of this, no police investigation into the missing victims that are shown on screen dying. No mention of them after. Everything just resumes as normal.\n\nWHY did Afton want the main character to work at the pizza place as a night guard after finding out he was the brother of the kid? WHY didn't the girl straight up tell the main character about her dad and instead \"hinted at it\". WHY did she have to hint. It's not like he was watching her. Nobody was. She could have just straight up said it.\n\nBy the way, she was supposed to be on duty, yet she stayed there the whole night with the main character. What about the rest of her route? Makes NO sense. How did she explain it to her coworkers when she was MIA for so long.\n\nWHEN THE TAPE MESSES UP, WHY DID THE MAIN CHARACTER HIT THE TV? INSTEAD OF THE VHS PLAYER? Hitting the TV will do nothing to effect the tape messing up, come on guys.\n\nWHY didn't the animatronics whip around quickly, like they did in the games? Why were they so slow the entire movie? All of the jump scares fell so flat because everything was too well lit and the animatronics moved too slow. Whats the point of a flashlight when everything's so well lit nobody even bothers to turn on a light to see.\n\nWhy are they scared of the Balloon Boy doll? You have to have CONTEXT for him to be scary. My mom, who barely knows about the FNAF series, watched the movie on her own and was completely baffled by why there were jump scares with the doll. It just. Looks like a doll. You have to know WHY it's scary for it to BE scary.\n\nIt's just not a movie made for anyone. Too bloody to be for kids, too boring for teens, too kiddish for adults. There are so many things in this movie that DON'T MAKE SENSE.\n\nThey don't even do a good job convincing you that he's poor, because there are government programs for people who need help with child care. Yet he is never shown reaching out about it and decides to just take his sister to work with him.\n\nHe also acts like the animatronics being alive is. Normal. He isnt freaking out about it. No reaction just. Huh? Oh. This is normal.\n\nHow did he know the kids were the ones from his dreams. Why did he just decide they were ghosts in his dream instead of just a dream. He looks at them and is just \"OH! You're the missing kids!\". What?\n\nSo people that are mad about people rating this movie poorly, understand that you can enjoy things and they can be fun, but that doesn't mean they can't be critiqued by people who expected the movie, that was inspired by a game, to be more like the game.\n\nI wish I could give it a higher score for the puppets and for Matthew being in the movie, but there were no many negatives that it cancels out the positives.\n\nThat's my honest review. I'm not a \"hater\" I'm not someone who never played the games. I'm a person who likes horror and likes good horror media, and this was not that.\n\nThanks for reading."

Whole atmosphere of the original game was that of a dream, location made sense but not the layouts of rooms, some things in the background just changed at random and you come back for some reason every night. If you really had to adapt it faithfully it would probably look like something similiar to a surreal horror like jacobs ladder\n\nThat being said this movie was ok, it established why the main character wants to spend 5 nights and i found the whole plot with his dreams somewhat interesting, i had couple of laughs and liked the set design. It had a basic story and i am glad that they kept it that way since the original lore is tangled since like i mentioned it was created on the fly just to feed the theorists. Overall a very averge but enjoyable movie, glad that it isn't a train wreck but it isn't also something to write home about, definitely more enjoyable than the mention security breach though."

However, the movie on itself isn't that interesting or cohesive. At some points it felt like a drama, then comedy, suspense, then an action horror but at an uneven pace. The new lore/story was an interesting take but it couldn't compensate for how messy and rushed the movie felt. I question why a studio like blumhouse kept the movie in production for a bunch of years, and being made \"top\" priority just for it to come up short stacked and lack lustered. There was big potential on how to handle this franchise as a movie series but I guess long time fans have to settle for less (corprate hollywood production). But hey, it's for the kids."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been a fan of the Fnaf franchise for years and like most fans, I've been waiting patiently for this movie to release for many years. Now that the movie finally released after 8 years of being in development, I finally got to watch the movie in theaters with one of my friends. Despite my friend enjoying the film, I personally left the film feeling incredibly underwhelmed and disappointed.\n\nNow, this film does have good elements, but I feel a lot of the bad outweigh the good. Firstly, the story in this film is really dull. I thought the film started solid but everything else after the beginning was dull, especially the side plot in the film. The movie is barely scary, the moments that tried to be scary literally made me laugh. The animatronics were the best part of the film... when they were actually a threat. I understand most of the lore in the games but what they did with the animatronics half way through rubbed me the wrong way. The actors in the film were okay but not outstanding. Same goes for the characters. Josh Hutcherson was solid as Mike but I kind found his character generic. Matthew Lillard was probably the best part of the movie, it's just a shame he was only in the film for only about 10 minutes. The setting for the film was cool but I knew I was gonna most likely like it. The ending to the film felt honestly rushed, would've benefited if it was a bit longer. The film could've also benefited from an R rating instead of PG-13.\n\nOverall, while I don't think the movie was terrible, I don't think it is good at all and was incredibly underwhelming. I am gonna be being completely honest, Scott Cawthon should not have wrote the screenplay. I would've preferred if someone else wrote the screenplay and Scott was a co writer or just a producer. Personally, I would only recommend this movie if you are a die hard Fnaf fan. Outside of that, I would skip this movie all together."

As for horror or scares, the movie has minimal. Definitely needed more suspense, killings and jump scares. This movie lack em all. The PG13 rating hurt this movie severely. Need to step it up to R for the sequel. The characters had great potential to make something scary but didn't deliver. Every night got tougher but not this go round. The girl seeing ghosts was a bit confusing at first but played into the story which helped explain the other characters. The movie was good but could've been so much better with an R rating."

People say its bad because and I get it but in my opinion it was a good movie, if your a fnaf fan you should definitely go check it out.\n\nThis movie contains some Issues but along the way they explain why is that, well in example there were some corny scenes. Where they all build a fort and lied together on the floor what was a flaw. That was because afton was trying to lure the kid so he can kill her. There was some lore but the movie dosen't really explore or dive too deep into it. Solid 7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was fine until exactly 1 hour and 10 minutes, when the generic exposition cop woman randomly threatened to shoot the main character for no reason whatsoever. Until then I was like \"this is fine - fan service, a predictable insertion of tons of female characters because it's the 2020s, a kids rating, so no violence, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad, so overall - nothing too surprising or bad.\"\n\nBut yeah, the cringe factor got cranked up so hard in those 5 seconds that I legit stopped watching it, because I lost all interest, this is bad. I should've expected it to be cringe and misandrist considering it's proudly directed by the same woman who made M3gan, I guess, but I did expect some competence.\n\nBut yeah, overall, it's a really bland and generic movie based on a game that had no lore whatsoever until a youtuber pulled some out of his rear end for views, singlehandedly creating some (bad one).\n\nThat same youtuber also has a really corny cameo, I guess for the kids to cheer over, but... yeah...\n\nCringe.\n\nTo be fair, though, the visual presentation is great, and the acting is surprisingly good, at least from the main guy. He goes above and beyond with what he gets to work with - a silly movie with a ridiculous plot - but he carries his weight and shows a great range of emotion throughout. Too bad his efforts were wasted in a movie this bad."

        "review_title": "A clever take on the hit horror franchise",
        "review_detailed_main": "This movie met my expectations, I was not impressed or disappointed. The plot was altered from the game series; however, the story was told in a way that closely related to and respected the franchise and long-time fans. This movie was not straight horror, but for those familiar with the franchise, Five Nights at Freddy's tells a much deeper story than simple jump scares. That being said, the jumpscares in the movie were well spread out and moderately scary. There was a large family component in the movie that the books and the games both have, and it is unclear if some of the deeper meanings in the movie shine light on some of the secrets in the game. The story was well-paced; some dialogue clips seemed to be cut for time, but the movie itself wasn't rushed. The movie's theme is the same as the games: very family-based. The animatronic characters looked amazing! I was very impressed with the designs and shocked at how closely they resembled the in-game characters. The cast and acting were on point. Matthew Lillard may not be British, but he still pulled off a great William Afton. The dialogue was okay; it certainly wasn't jaw-dropping. Many long-time fans will spend most of the movie dissecting the dialogue to determine how similar the characters are to their in-game counterparts, as well as finding out the backstory of new characters. The backgrounds were really cool. The set was not the in-game building; however, that makes sense, considering the story was also altered. The atmosphere will feel familiar for long-time fans, and the setting has not changed drastically. The music and soundtrack were very nostalgic and definitely added to the ambiance. Overall, this movie is a great childhood throwback, but it falls short when compared to its game counterpart."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't have a lot to say other than that I haven't seen a video game adaptation this bad since Paul W. S Anderson's Resident Evil series. I don't really want to fill this entire review bubble up but I would HIGHLY suggest avoiding the theater for this one, it's a mess and a big one at that. It has way too many plot holes and pacing problems that it's unbearable to sit through- the acting from Hutcherson and Lillard is good, but I cannot say the same for the rest of the cast whatsoever.\n\nIncredibly underwhelming and worst of all: not scary, whatsoever. This film's tone was back and fourth and I couldn't believe what I was watching for nearly forty minutes.\n\nAs far as adaptations go, it's bad, and I mean really bad. It's own story felt completely rewritten by Hollywood executives and not Scott himself, and it's just disappointing to such an extent that it's hard to imagine Scott even had a hand in any of this whatsoever because I couldn't imagine him being ok with the final results.\n\nOf course there's the PG-13 issue but this is something I somewhat anticipated (the games were never hyper violent nor gory, just dark material as far as storyline goes) but it's held back so much by dropping the violence in favor of weak jumpscares- it's disappointing to say the least.\n\nI dunno guys, I couldn't recommend spending nearly $12 to go and see this in the theaters- luckily we caught this on Peacock but it's really not worth admission for what you're expecting. Is it cool seeing the animatronics? Absolutely. Is it frightening and dark like the games were? Nope. Is the story just like the games? Nope.\n\nLook, take it as you will but it's just not worth your money. It's disappointing and I think the best part out of it all was Corey and that's all I could gather from it."

        "review_detailed_main": "LIKES:\n\nThe Graphics Are Decent -It's a movie about bringing robots to life, and they did a great job of doing just that, but sticking to the spirit of the game.\n\n-This film has the robots looking like metallic behemoths with frozen faces changed only by limited motor movements, and yet keeps the fluffiness of the mascots of the franchise.\n\n-Certainly it's not the most realistic looking piece of equipment, but it works with the franchise looks.\n\n-And seeing them move and enact their ploys on the human patrons, is very much in touch with what Cawthon drummed up all those years ago, and keeping to the cartoony finishes for the most part.\n\nThe Acting: -I can't say it's the strongest, most unique, or really stuck in the line of so bad it's good. This movie's cast does a good mob, it's just a moderate role with good execution.\n\n-Hutcherson actually feels like his Hunger Game roles, that sad dopy, and haunted look playing so well with his pouting, screaming, and anguish that his character has.\n\n-Rubio is wonderful with the performance, awkward, odd, but innocent a perfect contradicting optimism that cuts through the grey of this movie, and really explodes as the movie presses on and she gets further into the mystery.\n\n-Lail is okay for me. There are moments where she shines and has depth, and much of the time seems a little flat, relying on some more of the \"action\" to deliver what she can deliver.\n\n-It works to have characters that dive into the heart of the material and what people want, and for the most part is a fine addition to what I expected this movie to be.\n\nGood Pacing: -For what this movie is trying to accomplish, the pace is actually rather impressive in terms of the age ranges it is trying to entertain.\n\n-FNAF's story in this iteration may be simple, but you find that you are presented with a lot of good information and elements with decent time in each, without losing momentum.\n\n-With plenty of time to give to both human and animatronics, this film was able to keep the various members entertained and not get lost in the added theatrics that are often seen in the books.\n\n-And I felt that I never wavered from the FNAF lore or gimmicks this movie was expected to have.\n\nFunny: -It's a campy series and has a lot of twisted humor styles that most should enjoy and expect to have in this series.\n\n-One level is how cheesy a movie version is, more so the idiocy of the humans and just how humorous the animatronics are in this rendition.\n\n-Other times the expressions and personalities of the robots are hilarious, the emotions and the blending with the robotic nature are just so well-executed that I couldn't help but laugh at their use.\n\n-As expected, the movie also sometimes is funny even when it's not trying to be, because of how cheesy it is or ridiculous the acting/scene comes out to be.\n\nGreat Music... for the Movie -It's a minor like for most, but I loved the track selection and just how fitting into the 80s vibe it goes to set the moment.\n\n-The tinny sounding tones of the synthesizer, the upbeat bass with flashing lights and whistles, and even that hyperactive voice all work together and somehow tell a story with it.\n\n-But At the same time there is the FNAF brand of music in what sound like Tim Burton inspired tracks, with eerie tingles, that offsetting string sound, and the deep resonance to indicate ominous happenings.\n\n-And the end credit song won points from me too, and I really enjoyed the blending of the words to go with the aspect of the movie.\n\nThe Setting: -It's trying to find the footing in the timeframe of the games, which means going back in time and they accomplished the look of the decade with it.\n\n-Clothes and outfits are limited in this one, but the pizzeria itself was beautiful at what they accomplished in reviving the excitement of the venue.\n\n-But always adding that ambience of horror with it, the abandoned feel, making it a playground of particularly petrifying putridness come out in all the glory, but keeping it kid friendly of course.\n\nThe Story: -It's more direct than the games, which can be good or bad, but FNAF the movie has several stories trying to be worked in and connected.\n\n-The main story feels decently fleshed out, tying most of the leads together and adding personalization to include Mike's character beyond trying to survive.\n\n-Fans of the franchise will still get there classic story, and sticks decently close to the original, with a few tweaks to adapt to this story, and the calling cards with it.\n\n-And there is another story that jumps the gun and shakes things up, potentially mixing up the theories to come, but again makes the inclusion of a character worth it.\n\n-All in all, the stories are nothing majorly special, but decent in blending tradition and new twists in my opinion.\n\nFan Service: -My favorite part, is of course the fan service built into the movie, not just the story, but the Easter eggs in the film.\n\n=The opening credits alone show you what is coming, but the roving eyes will find pictures, props, and plenty of things to get excited about as you wonder if they'll do more.\n\n-Cameos are heavy, plot elements are hinted, there are background pieces with whispers of what is to come, and even an end credit hit that should please many fans. It all comes together without getting in the way of the new and the story, and I really liked that.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nPredictable: -The movie is horribly predictable. A Syfy element that feels cheesy and lax, the story needed something more than sticking to the games.\n\n-Those who know the big bad villain will figure out all the twists right away, and the inclusion/revelation is rather mundane, with only the younger audience potentially blown away.\n\n-In addition, the story just needs more oomph and some of the plot elements could have been tapered or forgotten in favor of building up the other elements.\n\nMore Mystery Element Needed: -The game series was all about figuring out connections and deciphering layers to come up with the story.\n\n-While I like a more direct plot, the uncovering of the truth, the discovery, and the personality of many characters and elements needed that pop.\n\n-Maybe in a sequel, but this movie just felt so rushed to get to the shock values and mystery, that the detective work felt too easy and obvious to really be worth the effort.\n\n-And even the elements of adding those teaser layers could have gone a long way, but we already have about three games crammed into one story wise, and that makes me think it was a bit too mashed together.\n\nNot Scary: -Horror movies got to have that bite to stick, and this movie did not even touch the scare factor for me and my buddy, more of the thriller.\n\n-It is censored for the key demographic, and I respect it on that level, but the entertainment value and edge gets dropped quickly without that scare element.\n\n-All the \"hunting\" for lack of a better word is stiff, the fight too short lived, and even the attacks themselves are often off camera, and when on point phony to an erroring degree.\n\n-Without that suspense, this movie is funny and cute, but rather boring at the same time and thus, not the Halloween movie they were aim to achieve.\n\nThe VERDICT: Five Nights at Freddy's had a lot of things to live up to for success and I think it does achieve this on many levels. My personal favorite portions are the recreation of the decade in sound and sight, unleashing a world that feels realistic, historical, campy, and fitting of the very universe created by the games. A story that might not be unique, but still has a good pace and ties many things together, with tradition and new age mixing well together to once more craft something for many fans. Yet, it's the fan service that will win for most, that campy cartoon look brought to life, and playing well with the actors to make something for the prime audience members to enjoy and that was great. However, the modern age and limitations of the film buffered the horror aspects and made the movie lacking in terms of that Halloween spirit I wanted. It's cute factor robs the movie of that dark and dismal bite this franchise thrives on, and with it the mystery element that is the lifeblood of this series. With predictable twists and lacking the thrills, this movie suffers to live up to the danger that each game always has. With all this, my scores are:\n\nHorror/Mystery/Thriller: 6.5 Movie Overall: 6.0."

Based on the popular game, Five Nights at Freddy's successfully brings the creepy atmosphere of the universe to the screen. Director Emma T. Daniel skillfully builds tension, turning an abandoned children's entertainment center into a real trap for the main character, who starts working as a security guard. The animatronics, mesmerizingly sinister, become the center of horror, causing fear with their childish yet menacing charm. Aaron Montgomery, playing the security guard, successfully conveys a sense of hopelessness and dread, and the supporting cast adds depth. The film balances moments of anxiety with a necessary dose of dark humor, which is a pleasant surprise. Although some plot twists may seem predictable, Five Nights at Freddy's captures atmosphere and nostalgia, finally giving fans a film adaptation that respects the original and engages a new audience."

PG13 says it all really. They should have bumped it to 15 or 18 and actually showed the horror instead of cutting off any potential horror. I just do not see the point in having somebody get killed but not get killed but they are killed. What I mean is, person about to get killed then scene changes to something completely different and of course, they are dead but no death shown. Make it a 15 or 18 and have it like saw. Show it all. What a big let down. I would say watch Banana splits, it is bad but it is better than this rubbish."

Worth watching if you're a moderate fan of five nights at Freddy's but otherwise don't bother, and if you are a big fan then expect the possibility of a six out of 10 level story at best.

        "review_detailed_main": "Im not labelling this as having spoilers because it doesnt really but it is very much my opinion and may not be helpful in your desicion to watch the movie.\n\nI will admit the movie itself is quite good but only if you have never heard of the games or only know a few things about fnaf. I have played all of the games and know a lot of the lore and i personally did not like this movie at all im only giving it 2 stars because i know a lot of people dont care about the game lore.\n\nIf you do care about the already established lore you will not like this movie it is extremely dissapointing and completely erases everything about the lore and makes its own up.\n\nIf you do not care about lore then its a fine movie its not horror though the gore is underwhelming and you dont get much violence or many jumpscares to be honest. It doesnt really explain to much and expects you to figure out the plot on your own and the big plot twist towards the end of the movie was spoiled by the cast list before the movie was even released. The story is sloppy and it is not explained to well, the pacing of the movie is a bit odd but it is not to bad.\n\nOverall the movie itself is a 7/10 max i would say 5/10 if i had only played the games and didnt know much of the lore but if you do know a lot about the story of the games and were expecting the movie to go by it then the movie is not very good and a major dissapointment. I personally did not think it is the cinematic masterpiece everyone makes it out to be."

In game to film adaptations I usually tend to be sceptical about how good it will turn out. I was also unsure about how Josh would do in the lead role, but I was wonderfully surprised- he did a stellar performance. The animatronics were what I was most excited about and I'm blown away by how great they looked on screen. It was so hard to remind myself that the animatronics were real puppets because they looked so good. There's not a lot of practical effects in movies anymore, most things like that are just CGI now. The movie blew my expectations out of the water. I've watched it multiple times now and love it more each time."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's unlikely you'll ever see something this incompetent, boring and slow be so highly regarded by an army of devoted online fans again - until the sequel is made at least. It's made for fans to do the Leonardo pointing meme at the screen for the rote references/ cameos and nothing more.\n\nSuch is the fan power to thrust a \"horror\" adaptation that is so disinterested in trying to use what made the first game a viral sensation - possessed animatronics hunting and jump-scaring an almost helpless security guard - in favour of tedious amounts of justification for nonsensical plot points and lore exposition dumps that drag the pacing to a crawl. None of the twists surprise, all heavily predictable or meaningless (or entirely expected by lore gurus) while every jumpscare attempt pales in comparison the games. Freddy and co might be impressive practical recreations but they're utterly stiff when visible, only actually able to attack when off-screen which leads to an unintentionally hilarious dream sequence. They just don't do much given their capabilities, and the cupcake gag becomes overplayed. There didn't need to be gore to be scary - just good directing, writing, staging and sound, none of which is here.\n\nPerformance wise, only Mathew Lillard does anything to entertain the absurd (it always has been, just admit it) premise with a bit of hammy acting for the very few short minutes he's there. The rest are mostly monotone or just poor; I never understood why Abby hated her aunt so much and would prefer her disinterested brother Mike (a sleepy Josh Hutcherson), other than the sloppy writing just making her a greedy Karen who the script forgets entirely. The actress for Abby has the worst line reads of the lot and never looks frightened, while the police officer spouts exposition and becomes friends with Mike for no good reason at all.\n\nAs for that directing, the individual shots and sets out of context look fine - altogether however it's a mess, as if she wasn't confident about how certain moments would turn out and just shot it from tons of different angles for no reason with mostly poor lighting. Tonally the film shifts from attempted horror to drama, back into attempted horror, drama again, then an abrupt light hearted family comedy before shifting gears towards drama and poorly executed horror final act. That resolution to the conflict... it's just plain stupid. If only you could draw pictures in the games, or carry a taser.\n\nBut none of this matters to anyone who has an emotional investment in the reception of this film. They've waited a long time after plenty of games, let's plays and lore videos to feast on, and they'll be damned if this film isn't an 11/10. Understanding Scott's convoluted lore doesn't make this better - only lowering your quality standards and being biased towards the IP will."

I did see a preview of this beforehand but even that just wasn't appealing to me.\n\nThis might be because I don't play video games anymore but this was just boring to me. It's really not even considered \"horror\" to me. It's more like comedy disguised as horror.

The horror side is too soft, the story is simple, designated to easily hate the villains, and love the good one at the first sight. So the people that I'm recommending this movie will be, if you are the age I was when I used to enjoy five night at Freddys, and you are a fan . Go for it, you will like it. But if you don't, you'll probably won't enjoy it. I recognize the effort, in the graphics, the ambient and sound effects. The end of the movie is also making me curious about what going to happens, but that doesn't change my opinion. 5 out of 10 will be my score, wich means \"ordinary\"."

Also, I instantly guessed the man-child actor was some sort of low-effort YouTube FNAF clickbait \"content creator\" who was an embarrassing presence in this film.\n\nThe puppets being created by the Jim Henson studio generally looked like garbage and are probably the worst thing to come out of the studio since his death in 1990. Covering them in CGI doesn't exactly help either. The cupcake was particularly egregious as it looked completely goofy and toothless and did not incite any terror. Not that anything in this movie possibly could unless an actual baby were to subjected to this trite.\n\nP. S. I don't care about who Springtrap is or the line he ripped off from Terminator.

        "review_detailed_main": "As a longtime fnaf fan, the Fnaf movie is wonderful and disappointing in equal measure. The acting is alright, with the three leads of Mike, his Sister Abby and Vanessa being quite strong, and the rest of the cast, especially Steve Raglim, being aggressively unconvincing. Steve does have some funny moments, which is not uncommon in the film, as even though its a horror movie, there are a lot of good laughs as well. Youtube enjoyers will certainly enjoy seeing some familiar faces on the big screen. One thing that the movie absolutely nails is the visuals. Never has Fnaf looked more alive than in this movie. The team at Jim Henson did an amazing job with the animatronics, and they finally look as I always imagined then to be. Their movements are extremely fluid, and look straight out of a robot workshop. Their designs are fantastic as well, with Chica and Foxy looking absolutely incredible. The animatronics also work very well as both antagonists and deuteragonists. They are creepy, yet charming, intimidating, yet welcoming, which I think is perfect for the haunted animatronics that they are. Speaking of the characters, this is something that I am quite mixed on. Mike is done very well, the audience is given time to understand him, and he is both likable and flawed; a great main centerpiece to ground the story together. Abby is also a great addition. While her character can be simplified to a simple \"little girl character\", she certainly stands out in her own way. She is just as likable as mike, with a quick mouth and a smart mind. Vanessa is ok, but I just think the film did not give her enough time to develop as a character. We are told that her dad roughed her up, but thats about it. Her motivations, and deeper psyche are never really explored, which I think is a shame, since I think she could have been a great compliment to Mike. The movie even teases us with the possibility of exploring her further, with one solo scene of her just staring at a wall, but it never goes deeper than that, which I think is a mistake. As for the actual plot of the movie, this is where it loses me a little. I certainly appreciate the approach of giving the film an actual arc, and I loved much of the background behind the murders in the 80s, but the film is just very stereotypical and clich\u00e9. It is a story that I've seen around 100 times, and it really doesn't do anything very imaginative. Mikes character arc is good, but it is largely carried by how likable Mike is as a character, and his growth throughout the film is very predictable. There is also a considerable lack of tension for a lot of the movie, and the last act, where the climax takes place, is very, very short. The last thing I'd like to talk about is the horror, and unfortunately there just isn't a lot of it. The gore is very limited, and there just aren't a lot of very frightening scenes. This may be a big plus for some people, but for me, I watch horror to be scared. The film is clearly built with love, and really enjoyed the visuals and many of the characters, but I think the storytelling holds this movie back from being really great."

        "review_detailed_main": "Five Nights at Freddy's, based on the popular video game franchise, brings the suspense and horror to the big screen. Directed by a talented horror filmmaker, the movie successfully captures the eerie atmosphere of the game and delivers a chilling experience for fans.\n\nThe story revolves around a young security guard named Mike Schmidt, who takes up a job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Little does he know, the animatronic characters that entertain during the day come to life at night and have a sinister agenda. As Mike struggles to survive the five nights, he uncovers the dark secrets of the restaurant and its haunted past.\n\nThe film's visuals are top-notch, with the animatronic characters brought to life in a terrifyingly realistic way. The production design perfectly recreates the eerie atmosphere of the game, immersing the audience in a world of suspense and fear. The use of lighting and sound design adds to the tension, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats throughout.\n\nThe performances in the movie are commendable, with the actors effectively portraying the fear and desperation of their characters. The lead actor delivers a convincing performance as Mike, capturing his vulnerability and determination to survive. The supporting cast also shines, bringing depth to their respective roles and adding layers to the story.\n\nOne of the film's strengths is its ability to balance horror and suspense with moments of heart and emotion. It explores themes of isolation, survival, and the consequences of past actions, making it more than just a typical horror flick. The well-crafted screenplay keeps the audience engaged, with twists and turns that will leave you guessing until the end.\n\nOverall, the Five Nights at Freddy's movie successfully translates the intense gameplay and creepy atmosphere of the game into a thrilling cinematic experience. It's a must-watch for fans of the franchise and horror enthusiasts alike. Just be prepared for some jump scares and a few sleepless nights!\n\nI hope you find this review helpful!

One I have never played the video game so I have zero comparison/ might have missed somethings because of that. Two is generally im not a horror movie fan but i liked the actors in this one. Also wanted to see something different mix it up a little bit/ fitting for halloween.\n\nSo i did generally like the movie, i thought pace was good till the end where I believe it could have been explained or slowed down a little bit. I Like Josh and Matthew Lillard a ton , both were able to be vulnerable in this movie and show amusing characters.\n\nNow lets talk about the core element in the movie. The animatronics were amazing in my opinion , i wish the director would have had the animatronics in more of the movie. I think thats a minor note though. The tone and music fit well Good script, Good plot and climax . I think another thought of my criticism is the movie struggles with putting the puzzle pieces character background details together specifically the ending."

No. But it's not horrible either. Scott Cawthon took a simple concept of his hit horror game and experimented with the source material - which is quite faithful.\n\nThe movie can feel dragged out at times with questionable decisions and desire for a lackful story, but with such a simple concept, you can tell that there may have been some struggling when it came down to horror and comedy.\n\nIs this film enjoyable? Absolutely. Depending on the audience, you can genuinely have an amazing time with this film if you enjoy the franchise; however, if you haven't heard of 'Five Nights at Freddy's ' chances are you may not have the same great time."

The script seemed just fine, and the story about the main character could have been already well known but there was added to it this haunted man's fear and flashbacks giving us a better Halloween story in general. The older brother, as the man was, impressed me as a devoted family member, and this trait might moreover appeal to the audience. I thought the girl, his sister, was very take-care-of-herself independent, as well as cute, and these facts too were well acted in the show. I liked the way the unknown secrets all got settled or explained. A very decent but mild, Halloween movie. It would be great to watch by different ages of audiences since it featured kids as the underlying theme to it."

However, I decided to watch the movie because when I first watched the official trailer I liked it, a lot. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and kinda innovative. The storyline was well-written, well-explained and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and likeable. The filming location of the movie was mainly, inside a huge, creepy abandoned pizzeria in the middle of nowhere. The casting of the movie was nice and their performances were descent. Sadly, it was PG-13 rated, so it wasn't scary, nor bloody. In my opinion, it should have been R-rated. It wasn't a scary movie, nor creepy, however there were some jumpscares. Also, the killcount of the movie wasn't bloody and most death scenes were done off-screen (except, only one death scene during the 2nd act which was very brutal). At least, it was a very intense movie and there were some action-filled moments. The opening scene of the movie was kinda predictable, but it was very promising. The ending twist was kinda unpredictable and I enjoyed the 3rd act. Moreover, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both very well done. Gladly, the animatronics were very well designed and their appearances were kinda terrifying. Overall, \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" was an enjoyable horror film, kinda intense and I would definitely recommend it to anyone! Last but not least, I'm definitely looking forward for a sequel."

So what I was given, I was happy with. Now, there were some iffy things like some of the lore being mixed up and changed, the lead female protagonist being a little strange and it felt like there was more they could have done. I do know that this is not the last movie as there will be at least a sequel to this one.

It's complicated subplots and secondary character storylines that end up connecting to each other. All of which were absolutely ignored and vagely resembled the original source.\n\nDo you want to make a whole new thing, inspired by the games? That's alright (though I believe it's a huge missed opportunity), but we can work with that.\n\nHowever, the problem is, this movie does NOT stand by itsfelf. It has absolutely no idea what it wants to be.\n\nIt starts as a drama, then turns into poorly animated gore, then suddenly it's a lazily written sitcom. This movie jumps into genres like it was Super Mario, and none of them really seems to fit.\n\nThe plot is an atrocity. Spends 1/3 of screen time on a bunch of side villains that barely have anything to do with the main story. Until the script itself realizes it's a waste of time and gets rid of them.\n\nI could go on for a while, but it's not worth it. It's so bad it could be considered unintentional comedy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Five Nights at Freddy's is a video game series that I have yet to play. I've always wanted to and I've heard great things, I just never got around to them. Based on the creepy images and a bit of gameplay I've seen, I was all in on them giving a live-action film a try. Well, it's now playing in theatres and available at home and after watching it, while I did enjoy it, it's a film that feels confused with itself. I don't think it's quite the movie even fans of the games are expecting it to be. Here are my thoughts on Five Nights at Freddy's.\n\nMike (Josh Hutcherson), an older brother who is currently fighting for the custody of his younger sister, takes the midnight shift as a security guard at an old children's arcade called Freddy Fazbear's. After making friends with a police officer, Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail), she tells him about the creepy goings-on of this place. The animatronic robots that used to sing and dance on stage for children are now possessed. The reason they're possessed is pretty twisted, so I'll leave that for you to see for yourself. Here's the thing though, I'm not sure how creepy this film really is.\n\nThe light-hearted nature of each character elevated the film enough times where comedy was working, but it's also a very sad story when you get the backstory of Mike and his sister. On top of that, there are jump scares, but also 80s music played for fun sequences. I wasn't sure if this film wanted to be a drama, a horror film, or just a fun, silly experience. There were multiple times when I could tell they were going for something scary, but the visuals just had me having fun with it, which I'm not sure if they intended or not. There are a few jumbled tones that didn't work for me. Still, I did have a good time watching it.\n\nIt was nice to see Josh Hutcherson in a leading role again, Elizabeth Lail had some good chemistry with him as well, but the movie itself, for as interesting as the backstory is, feels messy. This should've been a simple, creepy horror film about being stuck in this place overnight, but far too much time is spent away from this building and I just found myself torn as to whether or not it actually worked as a whole. Credit should be given to director Emma Tammi and the entire team who did the effects work here though. I don't think much CGI was used here at all. The set pieces were terrific and a joy to look at. In the end, Five Nights at Freddy's delivers some enjoyment, but nothing more to take it over the edge."

A movie that feels like it's been machine-learned and reverse-engineered from YouTube fanfic, rather than rooted in any kind of recognizable human experience, behavior, or psychology.\n\nThere are moments where it feels like it could have become a more gleefully mean-spirited horror ride by really sinking its teeth into the story and actually biting down, but it remains hamstrung by the rating as well as a lack of creativity. Five Nights at Freddy's fails at being scary. The premise and setting should've made it an obvious horror win, but some baffling story choices and poor execution makes it feel like a missed opportunity.\n\nMy Rating : 4/10."

When I watched the movie last night I realized that my worries had kind of come true.\n\nThe story of the movie does indeed take plot points from the games and makes its own story entirely, which is alright, the issue is that the way they connect these points together doesn't feel right, it feels like someone who had a base level of understanding of the story and fan theories made a horror movie based on that.\n\nAs just a horror movie this would hold up a bit better, there are some good scares, tense moments and funny moments in the movie too, and I could definitely see myself enjoying this if I went in with only basic knowledge of the FNAF story.\n\nThe reason this movie fumbled so badly is that it prides itself as being **THE** FNAF movie, but making multiple decisions that bring it away from what made FNAF originally scary and what made FNAF's story so interesting in the first place.\n\nMy ultimate thought about the movie is this: if you want a decent horror movie experience, then do watch it, but if you want a good adaptation of FNAF, go watch some fanmade content, there's plenty of it out there, and the majority of it is good."

It's essentially two movies in one and they don't gel well together at all. The iconic FNAF elements that people are going to want to se feel wholly and totally out of place in its own movie.\n\nThe script chooses to focus on all the wrong things filled with sub plots and pointless side characters I frankly could not have cared less about. Any sentimental moments ending falling totally flat and come across as cheesy in all the worst ways. These animatronics never feel threatening at all and anything that comes close to a violent moment feels so tame in how it's executed that they never leave any impact. The script is chock full of ear scraping, cringeworthy dialogue and even knowing nothing about this IP I don't think there was a single surprise in the entire runtime.\n\nI had next to no expectations for this movie and I'm still baffled at just how bad this movie turned out to be. I might not have every played the game but if I had to guess I can't imagine fans really finding this story satisfying as an adaption. I just didn't care about anything that was going on and I was bored out my mind as a result Ans those are the worst kind of viewing experiences."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a troubled man still dealing with the trauma of having witnessed his brother abducted at a young age and is now struggling to serve as guardian to his younger sister Abby (Piper Rubio) who is often aloof and lost in fantasy. After losing yet another job due to an outburst of his psychosis, career counselor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) offers Mike a job working nights at the closed down family entertainment center Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. As Mike takes the position routinely sleeping and revisiting his recurring dreams of memories of his younger brother's abduction, strange occurrences appear to be happening in his new job that infiltrate his dreams.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's is the long awaited film adaptation of the video game series of the same name created in 2014. With the initial video games becoming quite popular, development on a film began not long after their release with Warner Bros. Acquiring the rights in 2015 only for it to linger in development hell with a revolving door of creative teams and companies attached at various points. Eventually the film gained traction at Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 in spite of similar films like 2019's The Banana Splits Movie or 2021's Willy's Wonderland beating this film to release and trying to ride the franchise's coattails. After an 8 year journey to the screen, Five Nights at Freddy's looks nice but just doesn't have a compelling story or characters that made it seem all that special.\n\nTo start off on a positive note, Five Nights at Freddy's is a very handsome production and considering it had more resources than Willy's Wonderland or The Banana Splits Movie it certainly can be seen on screen. The animatronics were made by Jim Henson's Creature Shop and manage to avoid looking like guys in suits and actually do feel like clunky heavy animatronics you'd seen in an 80s children's play place. However despite looking the part, Five Nights at Freddy's never felt all that scary and it didn't feel like there was much of a payoff. It's really not the film's fault that some of the novelty has worn off by being beaten to the punch by imitators, but even being imitators those films offered more in terms of memorability like the over the top gore in Banana Splits or Nicolas Cage's mute action hero performance in Willy's Wonderland gave those films that extra something to make them stand out. While Josh Hutcherson is clearly giving his all to the performance, Mike just isn't that interesting as a protagonist and my mind just went to other films that did this concept better some of which came from Blumhouse themselves. M3GAN from earlier this year had a stronger fractured family dynamic and more energy to the horror and entertainment value, and last year's The Black Phone did the concept of a serial child abductor and the victims' ghosts much more intensely. I was very much reminded of that William Brent Bell movie Separation from a few year's ago where it was mostly very stock (with the exception of one or two decent elements) and that's unfortunately where I fell on Five Nights at Freddy's.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's might please diehard fans of this franchise with its attention to detail and plethora of easter eggs, but for me personally I felt underwhelmed beyond the animatronics and production design and I'd welcome a Banana Splits or Willy's Wonderland sequel before wanting one for this one (which they imply with no subtlety is happening)."

The movie itself is uneven with its direction. Starting with a supernatural mystery film with Mike (Josh Hutchinson) suffering from nightmares about his past with his little brother. And having several same dreams of 5 children who have disappeared. The film gets repetitive with the dream sequences which slows down the pacing. Its a slow first hour start. When things do pick up. The film lacks the thrills and scares.\n\nThe acting is decent. The cast ensemble is okay. The music score is cool. Does feel like a similar score that came off from Stranger Things. Its a film that has easter eggs and references to the games which fans will love. The movie itself is boring with an uneven direction and lacking the thrills."

Enough to please fans. But as a standalone horror film, it lacks. Now, FNaF is usually associated with violence, gore etc. And it would mean it would be an unnerving, sometimes outright terrifying experience to see in the cinema, right? Well, no. This movie is hardly a horror film. I have to admit, however, there is gore and violence, it actually pushes the limit for a pg 13 to be fair, but it is just not enough for a franchise solely built on murder, jumpscares, ghosts and mystery. I still wonder what it could have been had it been r rated. However, where horror lacks, plot is embraced. Now, there are some question marks regarding the plot, but it is mainly well crafted, would not point fingers here. Another thing I have to note is HOW WELL DONE the animatronics are. They are amazing, I could not have immagined them better.\n\nTL;DR: Fans will love it, 11/10 for them, but for unfamiliar people it would probably be around a 6 or 7 out of 10. If you are looking for horror, don't expect to find it here, but if you would like a family horror movie, this one would do the job."

The fnaf movie is for the fans, and that's a BIG problem, mainly because of people who don't even understand what even fnaf is, and critics who want a good movie, not a fan movie.\n\nAnd there's another problem that (IN MY OPINION) needs to be said, IT NEEDS MORE BLOOD. C'mon, its a PG-13 movie, what would you expect? Yes, that's the problem, with such dark lore and devastating deaths, it needed more ''graphicness'' to really set up the environment and what fnaf is mainly about, tragedies.\n\nBut lets just hop into another thing that i personally could be executed better, THE HORROR, the movie isn't scary at all, just suspense, more of a thriller, more ''The Purge'' type of horror. But overall, with all the flaws it has, it a really solid product, i really liked it, Matthew Lillard did a perfect job as William Afton and Mike was very well acted, the story and Vanessa isn't what i was expecting, but it clearly was a really fun watch eating some popcorn and screaming to MatPat being in the movie, a really good time honestly. The final fight at the end of the movie felt kinda rushed but really well made, it could be better, but still well made.\n\nSo in conclusion, it could be better in A LOT of ways, but a solid movie, a really fun and entertaining watch, but ONLY reserved for the fans and to be hated by the critics. 7/10 well deserved."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really liked it, but I'm heavily biased. You could tell Scott Cawthon had oversight over everything that happened in this film and the story is very faithful to the games, just altered for a new audience. If you've played the games or are very familiar with them, you will most likely enjoy this film, like I did. If you're not familiar with the games, I can understand if you are left confused and possibly disinterested and that's okay, it's not going to be for everyone.\n\nI will admit that the acting was hit or miss. Josh Hutcherson and Piper Rubio did a great job as their respective characters throughout the film, though it was a little iffy at the very end. Matthew Lillard was just okay, but I can see how Afton would be a difficult character to act. Elizabeth Lail's performance as Vanessa was honestly not very convincing to me, but to be honest her character isn't even that fleshed out in the games either, so maybe there wasn't much to work off of.\n\nThe production and set/costume design was really great in my opinion and should be appreciated. They really made the world of Freddy's feel real and dynamic. I also loved the cameo appearances!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Hmm, so this DIDN'T turn out to be the Halloween gift I was anticipating. I've played the first FNAF game on my PC back in 2014, and the only thing the film gets right are the animatronic designs. I can picture the director's passion in wanting to stay true to the game's lore, but as a horror film, Emma Tammi utterly fails to deliver the goods. The film sets up a backstory for its protagonist played by Josh Hutcherson, but the pizzeria and its fascinating inhabitants barely get anything substantial.\n\nThe tone is all over the place, and the film just doesn't let anything circumstantially funny be treated as funny. I think the makers went down the wrong path when they decided NOT to make this into a horror-comedy, which it well and truly could've been. The animatronics don't startle at all, and even for someone who hasn't played any of the videogames, this will come across as tame and lacking in thrills.\n\nHutcherson puts up an okay show, but I absolutely did not enjoy Elizabeth Lail's performance (or characterization). You could literally call her \"Exposition Dump\" and it'd make no difference. Matthew Lillard is sort of there too, but what's even the point? I'm guessing the PG-13 rating is in line with what the original games wanted to offer: less gore, more atmospheric. Here, they achieve neither. And that's certainly a knock on the game's creator Scott Cawthon, who's part of the writing team here. There are too many scenes where violence is implied, but never shown. Ugh, bummer!"

This alone felt like a snooze fest for me, too much plot and not enough of everything that makes a great movie good. I am mostly glad that I saw this for free and did not waste a cent on it. This being PG-13 explains a lot of how terrible this was. If only this was a rated-R movie with a lot less plot and more in-your-face pee-your-pants horror perhaps I would have enjoyed it more. I would bet there will be a sequel and if there is it better exceed my expectations but I highly doubt it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The only reason fans hate this movie is because they were expecting the movie had something to do with the lore or at least similar with, they also expected the animatronics to act original as within the games via very scary jumpscares. The acting was decent, animatronics were slow and cloggy but design is hard work. Hardcore and day 1 fans should not be setting expectations for something being waited for 8 years, rather expect a sequel and a day in the life type movie. There were references which I liked, Coryxkenshin and Springtrap's catchphrase. My expectations were high, but it's just a bread with nutella movie. So to summarize, it has nothing to do with lore, it's all new, the animatronics aren't what you're expecting, no scary jumpscares, it isn't a horror movie, Minimum age rating is 13 via not good comedy. 5-6/10. Writing isn't that bad, action is decent, plot is below average, no featured game originality. And yes there are post credits of coryxkenshin, and a secret message at the very end of the movie so you need to stay till the credits finish as well. The set was good but it isn't really necessary to watch this movie in actual theatres, it will make you leave disappointed since people who book the movie in theatres had high expectations. I hope the next sequels will be better than this, I don't really know what to expect for the next sequels because of the new plot So I'm probably expecting something new and hopefully the producers, direcotrs amd actors improve and learn their mistakes."

XD\n\nJosh hutcherson and Matthew Lilard were good as Mike and William Afton but I felt the storyline was just stiff and un scary. But hey if it's a thing there is a sequel going to be announced in the future , I will try to attempt on checking that out and hope that it would be better than this first one."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a movie that is for the fans. If you see passed the references and the callbacks, you see a hardly scary film with very questionable writing at about an hour in the film. A movie adapted from a game series known for it's jump scares, hardly has any at all. From what I remember, there is only 2 total. This movie is best when it tries to be scary, when it tries to build tension, it doesn't always land but there are parts where it works well. The acting is also incredible, Josh Hutcherson was a great pick and he did a great job, especially with his characters unique concept with his dream scenarios, I don't want to spoil anything so that's all I'll say about that. I also want to briefly mention Mathew Lillard, he is a great actor who is underused, but was great in every scene he was in. The animatronics also have never looked better, they did a great job with the animatronics in this film, they felt threatening when the scene makes them threatening. It wasn't an amazing film but I was surprised because I expected it to be awful, But the problem with that is, I'm partial. I like the lore of FNaF, it's really good and very interesting, it was made with passion, because of that I enjoyed the film. They did deviate the lore alot though, but it was still a fun film for me. If you don't like the lore or don't know it, then you wont like this film at all I imagine, Look no further than the critic reviews. There was even a fight in a UK theater over this fact, which was dubbed \"The Fight of 87\". Someone said out loud that the film was awful, so a fan went over and beat him up for it. I just wanted to mention that because this film is not for everyone, if you're a fan you will at most like and enjoy the film, if you aren't a fan, you will not like it. Maybe with the dream scenarios with Mike will make non-fans at least check out the lore of FnaF, but seeing this first will not win you over."

My guess is fans of the game may enjoy seeing it on the big screen but as a movie it is too mundane to stand on its own merits."

        "review_detailed_main": "Five Nights At Freddy's is exactly what you would expect. The sole purpose of coming to watch this movie is simply for the sake of the animatronics and because you're familiar with the games. So the story and the characters are not exactly the motivation for you to see this. Basically they don't matter to you. I'm sure most of us can be honest about that. If it wasn't for the animatronics at all, then why else would you be coming to watch this??\n\nIt indeed was good to see Josh Hutcherson. Of course him being a B list Actor, we know him mostly from the major works of the past he was in such as: The Hunger Games, Bridge To Teribithia and Zathura. For him leading this movie, he did good. He's never been a person that overacts. It was also good seeing Matthew Lillard, whom we know as Shaggy from the live action Scooby Doo and Scream. The rest of the cast did their parts good as well when it came to acting, but the thing is...for me personally...I didn't seem to feel enough sympathy for either of them. I tried really hard to, but with the story not being the most engaging to me, it was hard to pay attention and really care for the characters. Plus, a lot of moments in here are quite predictable.\n\nThe animatronics on the other hand were very well done! They executed the look of each of them perfectly! They look exactly like they are from the game and what makes it even better is that none of them are CGI. They are all real standing, moving animatronics. So hats off to that team for actually making them come to life! The Freddy FazBear Pizza Place in itself is also well designed. They managed to create the same look of the place, along with the classic monitor watching that we very well know of.\n\nWhile this is a film I probably won't watch again, I came to see it for the fun of the animatronics. And if you're coming to see this movie specifically with that mindset, then you'll have fun with it. But if you're coming to see it not for the animatronics, then I probably wouldn't bother with it if I were you. Therefore, I wasn't expecting this to be the best nor the worst. So it sits right in the middle just about where it should be. My real rating for this is a 5.5, if I had to grade it by letter, definitely a C+."

But overall it was enjoyable but like a masterpiece for what it could have been. It didn't disappoint me at all and wasn't a let down but it could've been better written. The villain could've also been revealed or put into the story of the films plot a little more though. The animatronics I think really good though. I also of enjoyed Josh Hutcherson in his role. Not too bad. People are too harsh on it. It wasn't the best but not bad at all."

If I wasn't already familiar with Five Nights at Freddy's and it's story and such, I would be disappointed. It sort of diverges from the horror bit after the first half and becomes more psychogical.\n\nA common misconception I've seen on here is that Five Nights at Freddy's was supposed to be a top-notch, all scary horror movie. However, Five Nights at Freddy's meets the criteria more for a thriller rather than a horror movie. Horror movies put the jumpscares and gore first, while thriller movies (such as this film) put the story first while they put the scares second, and that's what FNaF always has been."

It featured good characters, a good cast, and an interesting story.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of these things, if not all, are underdeveloped and left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe first two acts were slow and uneventful. My friend (the Five Nights fan) informed me that the first two acts contained a lot of lore. I am, however, not knowledgeable in any of it because I never played the games. Still, though, the story could have been developed faster and better.\n\nIrregardless, all the build up in the first two acts did pay off in a satisfactory third act.\n\nSo if they intend to do a sequel, then I would say there needs to be a stronger development for story and characters. I can see they have a lot to play with, but they just need to utilize it better, especially if they want to attract new fans.\n\nNonetheless, it's clear this film was made for the fans and little to no one else, and I can appreciate that. From the near sellout crowd in my showing, I can tell the fans loved it.\n\nIMDb: 6/10 Letterboxd: 3/5\n\nWatched in Theaters."

My hope was for a 5.5-6 out of 10.\n\nWe both enjoyed the show and decided the reviews were not entirely accurate.\n\nWhile it certainly breaks no new ground, what is presented is done passably well. We didn't find it particularly scary and while there were a few cringe-inducing moments of potentially excruciating pain, there is very little gore on screen and the horror elements, while not dissimilar to The Black Phone, are not dwelt upon in too much detail.\n\nThe acting was good and the writing wasn't bad.

The death scenes were lame as hell, I guess to keep it of-13. The only thing this movie has going for it is the costumes.\n\nNow going into spoilers...\n\nIf you have followed the fnaf lore, as I have for some stupid reason, you will recognize most of the characters. They make you believe that we are following Micheal Afton and his sister who later turns into baby. He takes the security job, which makes no sense in the context of the movie btw, and Vanessa is introduced out of nowhere flirting hard. The animatronics only ever lightly attack Mike while he is sleeping and he doesn't even know they are alive until 3 nights of sleeping there. There is no classic fnaf gameplay moment to be had. Phone guy turns out to be afton who is also Vanessa's father who stabs her. I couldn't help but laugh at that scene. Mike is revealed to be Mike Schmidt which was pretty lame. I could go on about how bad this movie was but I'm done wasting my time on it. The timelines don't seem to match up with the games so I assume it's not canon. Fnaf lore has always kinda sucked anyway."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently watched the FNAF movie, and I had a great time with it!\n\nNow, does that mean it was a good movie? Ehhhh...\n\nFirst of all, I should clarify that I'm not really into FNAF. I know it involves animatronics and a killer who targets children, and now those children are the animatronics who, in turn, go after other kids while pretending to be animatronics... yeah.\n\nI should also point out that I'm not a fan of horror in general. I enjoy intense movies, but watching a film about a demonic-looking creature brutally attacking someone isn't my cup of tea. However, in the case of this movie, aside from some corpses and intense scenes, it wasn't all that scary. Maybe I'm not a fan of horror because I don't understand the appeal of wanting to be scared. Many scenes that were meant to be frightening came across as laughable. I found myself chuckling during most of the \"scary\" scenes, which were essentially lame jump scares you might see in a Halloween candy commercial. If you're easily frightened, your experience might be different from mine, but it seems many people share this view, so I'll consider this as a feature, not a drawback.\n\nIn general, this movie felt strange yet oddly uneventful. Despite throwing a lot at the audience and being based on FNAF, which is known for being unsettling and scary, the movie surprisingly had a lighthearted and slow pace.\n\nFurthermore, it didn't feel like much of a FNAF movie. It seemed like a mishmash of various ideas vying for attention. A significant portion of the movie had little to do with FNAF, focusing instead on a character named Mike who tries to rediscover parts of his childhood through lucid dreaming or something similar to find out who kidnapped his brother. The movie also delved into Mike's struggle to gain custody of his little sister, Abby. If you're wondering, yes, this is supposed to be the FNAF movie, and we still haven't even touched on the animatronics.\n\nSo, if you're wondering how any of this connects to the game, well... Mike takes a job as a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's. That's about it. Did you expect something more complex?\n\nFrom there, Mike discovers that this place is much weirder than he anticipated ....FNAF. You know what FNAF is. If you're still reading and don't know what FNAF is, I'm not sure why you're here reading this in the first place. But you're welcome to read my review anyway.\n\nThe biggest problem with the movie is its scattered plot. As I mentioned earlier, many plot points don't seem to come together until the climax. The movie itself moves at a very slow pace, and while the plot isn't necessarily bad, it tends to drag. While I was interested in the characters and their stories, many scenes felt dull. A lack of tension and conflict permeated much of the movie, with characters aimlessly wandering through scenes, waiting for something interesting to happen. One of the issues is that the movie doesn't fully utilize the fact that it's a FNAF movie. I know I've mentioned this multiple times in this review, but the lack of balance in how the movie incorporates FNAF elements disappointed me. In the first act, the film hardly seemed to care that Michael was working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. It's frustrating to see how the third act rushes to combine all these conflicts, making you realize the untapped potential this movie had.\n\nDue to the poor pacing, many moments don't make sense either because they are too slow to care about or too rushed to explain what's happening.\n\nAs I mentioned, I was intrigued by Mike's internal conflict and his relationship with Abby. While these aspects didn't have a strong organic connection with Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria, I appreciated how the movie slowly integrated multiple ideas. However, it didn't go far enough. The climax felt rushed, resolving all the setup from the rest of the movie in less than 15 minutes. It was enjoyable, but I couldn't help but recognize that the climax could have been more complex and explored in greater depth.\n\nDespite my criticisms of the script, I have to admit that much of what I described was actually quite fun. There were scenes that were boring, but there were also genuinely interesting moments. The characters were well-developed; Mike had enough personality to make me root for him, Abby was endearing, Vanessa was likable, and the animatronics themselves were fascinating. I'd like to discuss the main villain, but I want to avoid spoilers, and he's barely in the film, just as I mentioned earlier, the climax was rushed. The acting, while not exceptional, was competent, and the charisma of the actors added to the movie's enjoyment. The animatronics themselves were well-executed with the use of practical effects, and Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria as a location struck a perfect balance between being a child-friendly pizzeria and a sinister, mysterious, and eerie place. From the colorful main stage to the grimy security room and the dark hallways, the setting felt complete. The film's soundtrack, featuring appropriate licensed songs and a memorable original score, added to the overall experience.\n\nThe editing and cinematography were impressive, with colors fitting the high-stakes yet over-the-top story. There were some great shots, especially at Freddy's. Overall, kudos to the direction department.\n\nIn the end, it's a mixed bag, offering both lackluster writing and entertaining direction. I'd give FNAF a 6/10; it's worth watching, if only to see a lady cut in half."

It's kind of crazy how rapidly this film will shift from depressing child murder drama to a happy-go-lucky fever dream. It doesn't strike that in-on-the-joke tone that M3GAN excelled at. While I think there should be some darker horror elements, far too infrequently does the film revel in the goofy camp of its premise. The dead kid stuff is just not very original and not very well executed. Add in being incredibly predictable with paper thin characters too.\n\nThis film also drags on far too long. You could easily cut 25 minutes and nothing would change. The story beats get hammered over and over with some honestly poor resolution. Five Nights at Freddy's is a big miss from a reasonably reliable studio."

        "review_detailed_main": "The FNAF movie, unfortunately, failed to meet the expectations of a devoted fan like myself. One major disappointment was the animatronics-they lacked the eerie realism that made the games so chilling. Instead of inducing fear, they came across as comical, diluting the horror essence. The jump scares felt forced, missing the organic, heart-pounding terror of the game series.\n\nMoreover, the movie seemed to take liberties with the established lore, deviating from the captivating narrative that drew fans in. It left me confused and disconnected, as if the filmmakers didn't grasp the intricate web of suspense and mystery that the games expertly wove.\n\nThe plot itself felt uninspired, like a recycled version of horror tropes we've seen countless times. It lacked the innovative twists and turns that characterize FNAF's unique brand of horror. The suspenseful atmosphere that defines the games was conspicuously absent, replaced by a generic and forgettable storyline.\n\nEven the soundtrack failed to capture the haunting ambiance of the games. The music in FNAF is iconic, setting the stage for the impending scares, but the movie's score felt uninspired and out of touch.\n\nAs a fan invested in the rich lore of FNAF, the film's deviation from established canon left me questioning the creative choices. It's disheartening when a beloved franchise is translated to the big screen and loses the essence that made it a standout in the gaming world.\n\nIn conclusion, the FNAF movie missed the mark for me. It lacked the genuine scares, narrative depth, and atmospheric tension that define the game series. While I had hoped for a cinematic experience that would elevate the FNAF universe, what I got was a subpar attempt that failed to capture the essence of Five Nights at Freddy's."

Not a lot of time is spent in the control room, either, but I enjoyed how they adapted the story. The film starts off pretty strong, even if the second half of the plot gets a little ridiculous. Still, the animatronics look great and I had fun. Maybe it's time I finally played Five Nights at Freddy's."

Unfortunately for this film, these instincts were valid in my experience, as for 114 minutes I was expected to endure a messy, childish rendition of what is far from a children's franchise.\n\nMatthew Lillard carried the acting for most of the film despite only appearing in two scenes. In general, this was yet another letdown from tinsel-town, as appears to be the norm post-2019.\n\nI will pay substantial money to see a reboot in the future - with James Wan directing and perhaps Spielberg or kin assisting Cawthon with re-writing. A last point or suggestion is to raise the target audience's age a tad to accommodate more mature story-telling and scares in line with the source material."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a movie fan, and not necessarily familiar with the popular video game, we're apt to approach this film with different expectations. Freddy's posits itself as a light horror chiller. The story offers little in terms of characterization, but what we can grab on to is that Mike, now caring for his younger sister Abby, many years ago watched his younger brother get abducted by a mysterious man, and has never let go of that incident. He relives it every night in his dreams. Unable to keep a job for long, he stumbles on a night security position at an abandoned children's pizza parlor, with large animatronic robots. When the night falls, things begin to take a turn for the worse, as Mike must uncover the mysteries within. The set design for the parlor and the animatronics are quite impressive and fun and will provide just enough scare for tweens and young adults. Adults will be able to latch on to the idea of loss and regret Mike faces, and it's a good introduction for youngsters as well to the idea that sometimes things that appear to be happy and fun may have a darker side as well. Mid level horror chills, that will likely be remembered by kids growing up in this generation."

        "review_detailed_main": "Five Nights at Freddy's has a very clear love for the source material however that isn't enough to make up for an adaptation that's light on scares and too heavy on lore. It's pretty funny and really weird but it's also almost entirely free of any terror or tension, constantly undermining itself and over-explaining everything to the point nothing makes sense.\n\nPossibly even more of a crime than any of that though, is the fact that it's just really boring, diverting almost all of its screen time to the wrong aspects. It's a serious contender for the least scary horror film of all time. Being gore free doesn't help either, it's hard to be scared of the animatronics when you can't actually see what they're doing to people.\n\nJosh Hutcherson ironically spends most of the film sleeping, his bored attitude does occasionally work in its favour until anything major happens, then he just feels too restrained. Matthew Lillard clearly understands the assignment and the only issue is he's not in the film anywhere near enough.\n\nEmma Tammi's direction has a fair few frustrating missed opportunities, even if the practical effects are cool. Early sequences use CCTV to establish themselves until they actually get to the Freddy's when that's suddenly dropped. A lack of jump scares is usually a good thing but considering the source material it's weird there's so few present.\n\nThe score by the Newton Brothers is surprisingly good. It switches back and forth between being an effective 80s homage and just really eerie in a way that's actually more unsettling than the animatronics themselves, who make way too much noise any time they move and don't look creepy enough."

Before i start the review, i want to say that i am not a fan of the game, but i still enjoyed it. The theater was packed to the ground and it was really fun, alothough there were some annoying people and some that smoked, but it's just a part of the experience.\n\nFirst of all, let's star with the plot. The basic premis with this dream stuff is really interesting, but it get's kind of messy with it's tones and sometimes you feel like watching a horror movie, but then you feel like you are watching an action movie and then you feel like you are watching a horror movie again and stuff like that. But i think in the end the dream stuff and the FNAF stuff blended pretty nicely. Also i think when it's a video game adaptation it's normal to be messy, because when you are playing a game, the storyline just gets over your head and you don't pay that much atteniton to it. But i didn't like the twist at the end. You can see it a miles away and you are not thath surpries when it happens.\n\nNow, how were the actors? Well, Josh Hutcherson was really good and the others are just fine i guess.\n\nThe director Emma Tammi aslo did a descent job. She used a lot of shadows and stuff like that to make the movie PG-13, which i think is the right choise. I don't see a univers where this movie is R-rated.\n\nThe animatronics most of the time were really good and i admire them for that, but sometimes they looked kind of silly, when they are chasing somebody for example, because you know that these are animatronics.\n\nAt some point i thought that they will screw up the whole movie and i was dissapointed, but then it shifts and becomes better. I just wanted to get that out of the way for the fans that think they are going to screw the movie up with some cheesy lines about friendship and stuff like that. But the whole part that i whought was dissapointing, was one of the weakest part of the movies.\n\nWe just have to talk about the cameos and refrences. The refrences are slick but you still notice them and i think fans will really enjoy the cameos.\n\nOverall, the movie as a piece was fine. I expected it to be much worse but it was enjoyable and i recommend you go watch it. It's not as bad as critics say. Also it's 6/10, but i'm giving it a 7 for attention."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been waiting for this movie to come out since the sixth grade, when they announced it. Did it live up to expectations, well sort of. It had its epic and fun moments, such as the opening scene where the intro was done in pixel art like in minigames, hoe the set was built and the entire pizzeria complex, animatronics, YouTuber cameos, fnaf song in the credits... details that met the expectations of fans. Also, for the first time, a complete story was put together, to explain a bit of the lore of the game franchise, which is a big plus for this film, but somehow the story didn't go deep enough. It could've been more building up and raising the intense of the story, until the final act.\n\nAs for the final battle, it was good, but somewhat disappointing. Instead of it being the main act, which in my opinion should have lasted much longer, they cut it as if it was irrelevant. Wasn't Afton supposed to destroy all the animatronics with the ax and be scared to death by the unleashed ghosts of children to bring him to his doom. Likewise, in the game in the seventh night, the night guard was fired because of the damage caused in the restaurant. Also, Freddy, who is the main star of this film, has barely 2 minutes of screentime. CUPCAKE, who is the most pathetic animatronic in games, dominated more than him. But Foxy was the GOAT, there's no arguing about that. In my opinion, the film as a whole is ok, but it could have been done a lot better, that's why I was a little disappointed. And why didn't Markiplayer appeared. Also, the jumpschers in this film are generally not scary, except for BallonBoy, who is just a toy."

        "review_title": "It puts the \"Fan\" in FNaF",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Five Nights at Freddy's\" is something of a foul ball in terms of how it manages to connect with its source material, though fails land within the expected parameters. While the base story is interesting enough in its own right, a number of tonal and performance inconsistencies hold it back from reaching its full potential.\n\nConcerning the plot, the movie opens up with a brief and frantic chase sequence that concludes with the demise of an unnamed security guard. The scenario then shifts to the perspective of Mike Schmidt as the troubles of his past leave him financially vulnerable to the self-serving advances of his aunt, whose attempts to take custody of his young sister Abby are nearing fruition. With little choice but to accept an uninviting job recently offered to him, Mike finds himself taking on the same role as the late security guard: monitoring the status of a run down and seemingly abandoned pizzeria. He soon crosses paths with officer Vanessa Shelly, whose unassuming interest in the restaurant takes a foreboding turn after Abby is forced to join him there. Upon discovering the truth behind the pizzeria's famous animatronics and learning of the connection they share with his past, Mike is confronted with a sinister ultimatum: would he be willing to forfeit his sister if it meant being able to be with his lost brother again?\n\nInterestingly enough, some of the strongest points of the narrative (concerning the utility of Mike's ongoing dreams) end up detracting from time actually spent at the pizzeria, which can be said of most of the character drama. While these sequences aren't wholly unnecessary when considering the larger picture, they effectively deflate the tension that actually takes place. It doesn't help either that the tone is shattered every now and then when cartoonish antics are slapped on the otherwise imposing machines completely out of nowhere, especially after the film goes out of its way to showcase their jarring lethality.\n\nThe characters themselves are decently fleshed out with each hitting different levels of success. Josh Hutcherson's (Mike) offered up a compelling arch as his divided motives of protecting his sister and learning what he can of his brother's disappearance created several interesting conflicts. Piper Rubio's (Abby) put out a fairly believable performance for a young actress, which can also be said for the other children seen within the dream sequences. And Elizabeth Lail's (Vanessa) was hit and miss, as earlier scenes of her acting felt forced at times while latter portions of the film allowed for it to land well.\n\nAs far as the visuals are concerned, the aesthetics of the restaurant were serviceable. The animatronics themselves, which appeared to be primarily practical rather than CGI, matched the first game to a \"T\". Sound design was efficient overall, which can also be said for the music at points. Sitting at a little under two hours, the runtime is merited, though the risk of dragging is still present.\n\nAltogether, \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" is far from being a terrible video game adaptation, though its mixed focus and lack of commitment to its genre left a great deal to be desired. While numerous references and easter eggs (including a cameo by FNAF-enthusiast MatPat) will offer up some treats for long-running fans of the franchise, it is hard to ignore how much missed potential went by the wayside."

There are some dialogues where i laughed so hard. I have no idea how somebody makes a movie like this, sees it and thinks \"Yup, its great\"\n\nWhat a joke, this could've been amazing, but they really decided to create this sad attempt of an horror movie.\n\nIf you are a fan, don't watch it, cuz u will hate it.\n\nIf u are not a fan, watch it as a joke or dont even waste your time."

        "review_title": "Visually beautiful, but with a Scooby Doo plot twist",
        "review_detailed_main": "On August 8, 2014, the horror game Five Nights at Freddy's was released on many game platforms and was a great success. The game was about an abandoned Pizzeria that owed its name to the company's animatronic mascot named Freddy Fazbear. Together with Bonnie, Chica and Foxy, he terrified the gamers. Now, nine years later, there is a real cinema film and then also made by production company Blumhouse. The question is of course what to expect from this. What speaks in favor is the fact that Freddy and his animatronic friends have not become computer-generated monstrosities, but real animatronic dolls made by The Jim Henson Company. In any case, this immediately ensures that the film is immediately 2-0, because visually the film is really very strong. In terms of story, it's all very weak and very predictable, but good. What do you actually expect from a movie about murderous teddy bear robots.\n\nThe film takes a huge run-up before something really happens. You notice from everything that they still want to delve into the superficial characters. This way we see that Mike can't keep a single security job. He lives with his sister Abby in the house their deceased mother left for them. But their aunt Jane wants custody of Abby, so she can raise money that she would get for it. When Mike eventually takes on a night job where he has to guard the abandoned premises of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, he has strange dreams about his missing brother. Out of nowhere there is suddenly the beautiful police officer Vanessa in front of the door, who stays with Mike every night and Mike turns out to find this normal. It causes a lot of vagueness and actually quite a bit of bored moments. Because up to that point nothing actually happens and you wonder why this film got the label horror film pinned. What is actually even more surprising is why this film has been set the age limit of 16 years and older in the Netherlands, while it has been given a pg 13 in America. Five Nights at Freddy's therefore feels more like a Goosebumps episode.\n\nWell, this sounds very negative, but that's not that bad. Once the film has made its way after just under an hour, it will all be entertaining. Mike's dreams about the running away children become clear and it also becomes clear what Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy actually are and what the big plan is. The final denouement seems to have been stolen from a Scooby Doo episode, but okay. If you adjust your expectations a bit and just don't expect a real horror movie, it's all fine to manage and it even becomes quite amusing. It is also a fairly bloodless work, because a lot is left to the imagination and this goes too far for very young children, but children aged 12 or older are really a little more used to than this. In the end, Five Nights at Freddy's turned out to be a fun movie, with beautiful visual effects and a movie where you don't have to think too much.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's is a visually beautiful film because the animatronics are not CGI monstrosities, but expertly made robots by The Jim Henson Company. Don't expect a real horror movie, because the level is from a Scooby Doo level. The film also takes more than an hour to get going a bit, in order to deepen the superficial characters. This was completely unnecessary and with a small 20 to 25 minutes of shortening, the creators could have really made their point with this almost bloodless work. This ensures that many people go to the movies with the wrong approach and that will also be fed with the kolderic age limit of 16 years and older. In the end, the film is just entertaining and fun and can still result in a nice sequel."

Are Americans people really this dumb? The amount of plot holes and scenes that just don't make sense is ridiculous. Obviously this is set up for sequels and never ending merchandise but PLEASE, don't bother. I can only guess that the producers are just interested in making as much money as possible and will flog this series to death with sequels, prequels and reboots for the next 10 years. Unless this turns up on a free site, save your money and just stick a finger in your eye. It's more fun and is considerably more entertaining than this movie."

Best part of the movie is the visuals and music at the end of the day, the plot / acting could have been better by a mile."
