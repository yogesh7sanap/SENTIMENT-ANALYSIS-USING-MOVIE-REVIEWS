        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing this special edition DVD which shows the entire 174-minute film (in addition to the 121-minute one that most of us had seen over the years,) my rating of this film was elevated. This review is of the longer \"director's cut.\"\n\nMost of the new footage involved the main's character's romance while he was a young man. The story then is continued years later when that character comes back to his hometown for a funeral and runs into the woman he was in love with but never was able to get for his own. It turns out to be a somewhat tragic love story.\n\nThe first part of the film, with Salvatore Cascio as \"Toto\" a young boy is a love story about two people sharing their love of movies: the kid and an adult \"Alfredo\" (Phillpe Noiret) who runs the local movie theater. Their love of film bonds them for life.\n\nThe word \"love\" is used repeatedly in this review because that's the dominant theme: the love people had for others and for the world of film, something all of us on this website share.\n\nThe second and third parts of the film are the above-mentioned love story of Toto (Marco Leonardi as an adolescent and then Jacques Perrin as an adult) and \"Elena\" (Agnese Nano/ Brigitte Fossey). The first third of this director;s cut edition is much livelier and interesting, frankly, than the last two-thirds. Although not boring, it does drag in a few spots but the longer version is better in the long run because it makes the whole story much more meaningful.\n\nIt's very nicely filmed and you get a real feel for the Italian people and their little town. The director of the movie, Giuseppe Tornatore, went on to make other great visual films, two of which I also like: Malena and The Star Maker.....but Cinema Paradiso, I believe, is considered his \"masterpiece.\""

'Cinema Paradiso' is simply the finest movie I have ever seen. Like many who have posted at this site before me I have seen it many many times. It reaches within me to places other movies have never reached and I have often wondered why. Perhaps it is because of it's simplicity. It contains no expensive special effects, it has no gratuitous sex or violence, it has no \"multi-millon dollar per performance\" actors that I know of, it is arguable whether it even has a story line, and yet it soars far above the nonsense that film makers are producing these days. It's characters are portrayed by each and every actor in award winning style and the music is not only beautiful but absolutely perfect for this film.\n\nIt is quite simply the story of a human life and it's tragedies and triumphs within the context of a vocation. A young boy matures and gradually learns the lessons of life, cultivates his passion for the cinema, and is rewarded with professional success; however, he remains unfulfilled for true love has escaped him only to return in the form of a gift of love which transcends time, space, and death to reveal at the closing of the film Toto's one true mistress.\n\nA staggering triumph of both the cinematic art and of story telling and yet there may be found people who do not like this movie .... I tend to keep such people at arms length and maintain a wary eye fixed upon them at all times."

A real masterpiece; i can't remember another movie so moving like this one, maybe Schindler's list; it makes you laugh and it makes you cry, yet it is so simple and straightforward. Maybe there lies its magic: no Hollywood superstars, no special effects, just pure emotions and feelings, love, fear, grief and regret, nostalgia for childhood and youth, memories of places and times that will not come back, memories of the loved ones. Some movies are there to entertain, some to scare, some to question. This movie is there to affect your feelings. Definitely to be seen."

The truly great ones manipulate your perception of reality, suspend your disbelief, and ultimately either alter or affirm your view on life. NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO is just such a movie. It is the near-perfect melding of direction, acting, script, sound track, and cinematography. Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio give the kind of performances usually associated with much more recognizable actors. The supporting cast looks like they could all be full-blooded Sicilians. The location shots add depth and realism to the entire production. Ennio Morricone's music is simply the most appropriate and emotive I have ever had the pleasure to hear in a theatre. Tornatore's script and direction are a joy, a breath of fresh air.\n\nI will not spoil this story by repeating it, nor will I give away the ending, although it matters not a whit. I could disclose fully everything in this movie, and in seeing it, all my words would evaporate. There is nothing like the experience of sitting through it, becoming engulfed by it, and in the end, being changed."

Even if this is not your favorite film, if you are a filmmaker, you have no choice but to say this is your all time favorite film (if not one of the greatest films ever made). If only for the movie's ending, this is a great film. The ending answers all of your questions and completes the story. The missing love from a Man's life. The missing pieces to all the stories (movies) found and made into a whole. The final message from beyond the grave, the ending is perfect. If the musical score doesn't put you in tears, the amazing visuals will push you over the edge. This is what all movies should be about. Terrific."

        "review_detailed_main": "To those of us who live in places less beautiful than Sicily, and which have lost connection with their peasant heritage much longer ago, there's a natural appeal to stories from that island. 'Cinema Paradiso' provides a nostalgic look at post-war Sicily, and also of Italian cinema during that era; in the story of how progress led to television, the death of the cinema as a social institution and the individualisation of people's lives, it recalls 'The Last Picture Show'. There's similarity as well in the conflict between attachment to one's community and the desire to escape, although it lacks Peter Bogdanovich's film's sense of overwhelming claustrophobia. Indeed, the emotional temperature of the film is actually quite muted, in spite of the surface colour and vigour. I enjoyed it, but (especially in a setting with such a complex historical and political backdrop) it could have benefited from a shade more intensity."

        "review_detailed_main": "This 1988 Italian film (released in the US in 1990), is back with a full 51 minutes added on. This seemed like a stupid idea...there was nothing wrong with the original. The directors cut (which was 1/2 hour longer) was considered a mess. Also, for this release, an extra 1/2 hour was added! I expected the worse. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that this 3 hour version is better than the 2 hour one.\n\nThis story follows the life of Salvatore. He's born in a tiny Italian village and we see him as a little boy in the 1930s, an adolescent in the 40s-50s and an adult in the 80s. It basically is about his love of movies and the one true love of his life--Elena. They are in love but she comes from a rich family and he lives in poverty. How can they be together?\n\nPOSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!!\n\nThe cut movie in the US excised a lot of the Elena subplot and concentrated on Salvatore's love of movies. There's nothing wrong with that, but Elena disappears quite suddenly. This full version explains what happened between them and fleshes out the characters more. It also reveals a crucial surprise at the end.\n\nThe performances are all fantastic--especially by the gorgeous young actor playing Salvatore as a teenager. Elena is also stunning. The film has beautiful cinematography and a haunting music score. The 3 hours flew by for me. I didn't want it to end!\n\nSo...beautiful music, attractive stars, good acting, compelling story and some incredible romantic sequences. A must-see!!!!\n\nBring plenty of Kleenex though--I cried a least 5 times!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Colorful and moving flick dealing with a wonderful friendship between a little boy and a solitary projectionist . However , being overly nostalgic , too sentimental and overwhelmingly sweet . Attractive and sensitive picture with stirring drama , ravishing cinematography and enjoyable musical score . A filmmaker (Jacques Perrin , he subsequently became a notorious director) recalls his childhood (Salvatore Cascio , Toto , who celebrated his eighth birthday during filming) , when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist (Philippe Noiret who said all his lines in French) at Cinema Paradise . The director goes back home to his Sicilian village for the first time after almost 30 years and is reminded of his first love (Antonella Attili) .\n\nIt is an interesting celebration of youth, friendship, and the everlasting magic of the films . Nostalgic and sensitive picture with thought-provoking drama , ravishing cinematography and moving musical score . The picture contains drama and nostalgia completely wrapped in an agreeable story between a lone man and a boy . The flick relies heavily on the relationship between an older man and a kid , subsequently teenager , but this does not get bored or spoils the tale . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time , the picture is enjoyable and entertaining , but overlong . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility , the intelligent screenplay was written by the same Giuseppe Tornatore . Giuseppe's intention was that this movie should serve as an obituary for traditional movie theatres and the movie industry in general , after the movie's success he never mentioned this again. This excellent and enthralling picture \u00a8Cinema Paradise\u00a8 was starred by extraordinary actors such as Philippe Noiret , Jacques Perrin and Marco Leonardi . Good acting from remaining cast , just like Antonella Attili , Enzo Cannavale , Leopoldo Triestre , Agnese Nano , Pupella Maggio, among others . Glowing cinematography with scenarios colorfully and stunningly photographed by Blasco Giurato who reflects splendidly the cinema , streets , square , village and many other things . Rousing as well as insistent score musical , including a continuous leitmotif from the beginning to the end ; being efficiently composed by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone . The film won several nominations and awards , Oscar included .\n\nThis weeper picture was very well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore . He is a writer and director, known for making similar nostalgic films including good actors , such as \u00a8Malena\u00a8 with Monica Belucci , \u00a8 The star maker\u00a8 with Sergio Castellito , \u00a8Baaria\u00a8 with Raoul Bova ; and \u00a8La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano\" (original title) or \"The Legend of 1900\" or \"The Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean with Tim Roth . Being his English-language debut feature titled \u00a8The professor\u00a8 with Ben Gazzara . Cinema Paradise Rating : Better than average, well worth watching for exceptional cinematography , first-rate acting and marvelous score ."

Certainly, if Giuseppe Tornatore had set out to make a feature intended to win a Best Foreign Picture Oscar, he couldn't have plotted more cannily.\n\nIt is, after all, a movie about how we start out as small children, trying to make sense out of the world, with nothing to guide us but stories in the dark.... and in the end, we end up that way, nostalgic for a time when we were confident that some day all would be revealed.\n\nWell, it hit all my buttons. Still, as I noted at the start, I chose the movies over life."

Marco Leonardi was the pick of the whole cast. Also watch Melena for those trademarks of Tornatore.\n\nThe character of Alfredo is one of the most unforgettable characters.

        "review_detailed_main": "This Italian motion picture achieved notorious fame, comparable to the equally famous and more recent Italian movie 'La Vita \u00e8 Bella'.\n\nLike that one, this one is also very good in its first half, but after that it becomes a movie of bad taste. That's really too bad, because this movie (and 'La Vita \u00e0 Bella') had potential to be something big.\n\n'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso' can be considered a homage both to cinema and films. It shows us the pinnacle of the cinema as an industry of entertainment and as an escape for those who go there to watch the movies, making them forget the hard reality of poverty and war. Besides the cinema's success, it also shows its progress, its bankrupt, its decadence and its sad ending.\n\nThis is a very simple film. However, simplicity doesn't necessary mean something bad. Plus, the brilliant and memorable soundtrack by Ennio Morricone adds lots of emotion to the film, particularly in its first half, which is without a doubt the best part of the movie.\n\nOne of the biggest charms of this movie is the fascination and enthusiasm of Salvatore (whose nickname is \"Toto\") on the cinema and the projectionist job. He wins the friendship of the local projectionist, Alfredo, who also teaches him all about that job. As you can tell, \"Toto\" is a very intelligent kid and a very quick learner. Plus, he is mischievous, cute and hilarious.\n\nOf course, even the first half has its minor faults, such as the pranks of bad taste - for example, that pig who spits to the audience and the prank with a bug on the sleepy guy. Pranks aside, I also don't like at times the behavior of Salvatore's mother: she slaps him a number of times.\n\nAs for the good of the first half, well, just about most of it. And this without forgetting Salvatore's dumb classmate. He's a poor dumb kid who doesn't know what 5x5 is. Whenever he answers that question is hilarious, as each answer is dumber than the previous one. In the 3rd time, he goes as far as replying \u00abNatale!\u00bb (which is \"Christmas\" in Italian) - when he said that, I practically died of laughter!\n\nAs for the 2nd half of the movie, most of it is wrong and seems quite rushed and forced. Salvatore is no longer charming as a grown up. The love story between Salvatore and the girl of his dreams is frustrating in all ways, not to mention that it's ridiculous that Salvatore spends entire months waiting for her to open the window as a sign that she fell in love for him. There is no comedy or charm as in the 1st half. An animal is stabbed. Salvatore joins the army. And Alfredo's attitude later is puzzling: forcing Salvatore to leave that town forever, never look back, never return (not even to visit, going as far as saying that if he returns he won't receive him in his house), never let nostalgia hit him and never to even write or think about them.\n\nI clearly prefer \"Toto\" as a child than as a teen or as an adult. \"Toto\" is far more charming as a child. In fact, the moment he grows up, for some reason the movie looses its initial greatness.\n\nPhillipe Noiret gives a great performance as Alfredo, but little Salvatore Cascio steals the show as little \"Toto\".\n\nI never saw the Director's Cut version. And frankly, I've got no interest in watching it. It's about 30 minutes longer, making it a too long movie and it certainly makes one view the film differently, as many of the mysteries are revealed (which might not be a very good idea). I saw the shorter version which isn't even that short, as it is nearly 2 hours long. But I can handle a movie of 2 hours."

A rose tinted view of youth, love, and times that never seem to stop changing is what follows and a wonderful story it makes for. One of the few movies to get a grasp on childhood along with Stand By Me, The Sandlot, and a few others.

It is wonderful in the first half and the cinema with the boy and his love of the clips, the cuts and the whole of his childhood, the projector, the man and his magic and his helping to as well. The splendid scenes of the cinema and the children and the adults are just as thrilling. As the boy gets older and falls in love it starts to get a bit too sentimental and later as him older it is really not as good at all. I find that the old cinema magic has gone and just too schmaltzy."

On the background there is a war ongoing but the episodes of the film don't make much connection to it. Story is a bit boring at least from a Finnish point of view.. Only one or two episodes made me smile a bit but the humor isn't too intelligent. Maybe this film is good for some people that can imagine beyond what is shown. For me; characters didn't matter much. Music is more happy than melancholic and I could probably compose something more touching.. :D. Maybe this was a good movie 20 years ago but today you can see much better films with more atmosphere and with a better script.\n\n-WarraX-"

To me, Cinema Paadiso is one of the best films of the 80s and also the most moving, particularly in the final hour.\n\nI have seen many visually stunning films, and Cinema Paradiso is up there as one of the most visually ravishing films I've seen. The cinematography and editing are outstanding, and the scenery still looks gorgeous with an epic feel to it. Cinema Paradiso, alongside The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West, also contains one of Ennio Morricone's most haunting scores and it is also one of my favourites of his.\n\nCinema Paradiso is immaculately directed, has an touching, beautifully-written and honest script and a rich, compelling story that while it has an elegiac feel moves swiftly by draws you right in until the ending, which breaks my heart still after 5 times of seeing it.\n\nThe characters are very well defined, particularly Alfredo, and the acting is outstanding with Salvatore Cascio, Enzo Cannavale, Marco Leonardi and especially Phillippe Noiret particularly impressive. All in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I wanted it to validate my own love of escapism, so wonderfully woven by incredibly directors who take us to such wonderful places that even our imagination couldn't have dreamed of. With such a grandiose name, the (lack of) family, village square, theater and boorish patrons fell short of endearing and, at times, fell short on many levels. Meaningful bits went on too long carried to 1970's made for TV levels by a overindulgent soundtrack. The actors played their parts, but with such inconsistent overdubbing, I felt for none of them. Yes the boy and projectionist bit was sweet, but not enough to carry the film. The older Totos' added no depth to the little boy. Conceptually nice and the scenes reenacting the crowds reaction to the theater and its limitations worked even if they were crude, but did we find a way to connect to movies as a character. I don't believe it was introduced until the final scene evidenced the character shunned from them by the church and I just couldn't relate, just like the film"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Cinema Paradiso,\" directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, is a heartfelt tribute to the magic of movies and the power of nostalgia. The film follows Salvatore, a successful filmmaker, as he recalls his childhood in a small Sicilian village and his relationship with Alfredo, the projectionist at the local cinema, Cinema Paradiso.\n\nThe story unfolds through a series of flashbacks, capturing Salvatore's formative years as he falls in love with the art of filmmaking under Alfredo's mentorship. Philippe Noiret delivers a touching performance as Alfredo, while Salvatore Cascio and Marco Leonardi beautifully portray the young and teenage Salvatore, respectively. Their on-screen chemistry is both endearing and poignant, driving the emotional core of the film.\n\nEnnio Morricone's evocative score complements the lush cinematography, enhancing the film's nostalgic atmosphere. The narrative is a bittersweet reflection on the passage of time, the evolution of cinema, and the impact of cherished memories. While some may find the pacing leisurely, the film's charm lies in its affectionate portrayal of a bygone era and its celebration of the communal experience of movie-going.\n\n\"Cinema Paradiso\" is a touching homage to the transformative power of cinema, leaving viewers with a warm, wistful feeling and a renewed appreciation for the stories that shape our lives."

It is now deemed an older movie, but it is still deserving of the praise and adulation it received when it was released.\n\nIt melds this incredible sense of beauty, romance, drama, and wit into an almost aesthetically perfect cinematic tour de force.\n\nAnd the performances bring it to life in a most magical and captivating way. It is absolutely enchanting and makes me want to go out and fall in love all over again.\n\nNot only does this gem pay homage to the romance of times gone by, but it keeps the romance alive, even today. Every time you watch it.\n\nIt's a movie about movies at its most foundational level. But it's so much more. It shows us what a film can bring to our lives. What it can teach us about humanity. And how it, quite simply, makes us feel.\n\nAs I watched this again, I am very surprised that the young men playing both Salvatore as a child and as a young man didn't do more. Unless they have made their mark in other countries to levels of which I'm unaware.\n\nSalvatore Cascio....what an amazing performance by that young man. I'm surprised he didn't win more than a BAFTA.\n\nAnd Marco Leonardi....talk about beauty personified. Whenever his countenance graced the screen it took your breath away. Where did he go, and why didn't he become the matinee idol to parallel the successes of Antonio Banderas, Johnny Depp, et. al. Such a handsome young man, and a wonderful actor.\n\nThank you, Italy, and thank you Giuseppe Tornatore for bringing us this artistic treasure."

He was a projectionist a run down movie theater which formed the center of entertainment in the community. We are introduced to Toto who lives with his mother who waits for her husband to come home from the Russian front. He is a scalawag who disobeys her and finds ways to spend time with Alfredo, the protectionist. He is in constant trouble but always comes to this man for direction, even though the guy finds him to be a pain in the butt. One night, the movie projector catches fire as does the film (nitrate film did this in the early days) and blinds the old man. Toto becomes the projectionist, even though he is but ten years old. He also becomes the eyes of his friend. He stays at the job, ignoring school, and eventually makes some modest films himself. As he does this, he sees a beautiful young woman with whom he falls in love. This whole film captures the essence of the city. We get to know a multitude of characters because their lives revolve around the movies being shown at the Cinema Paradiso. Toto (not his real name) returns to his home when his mother leaves a message for him that Alfredo has died. He has really cut off ties with the place and it is a painful trip back. But it pulls at our hearts. Things are almost magical. One of the best films every made."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am going to start this by warning anyone who has yet to see the director's cut of Cinema Paradiso: DO NOT WATCH THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!! I know everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I am saying this because I viewed both versions of Cinema Paradiso in my film class (123 min. version first, followed by the 170 min. director's cut), and with the exception of one person, everyone in the class wished that they had not seen it. At the very least, if you must watch the director's cut, I urge you, no, I implore you, to make sure you watch the 123 min version first. If you watch the 170 min version first, you are robbing yourself of a great experience you will never be able to reclaim; watching the 170 min version first WILL ruin the 123 min version.\n\nAfter we first viewed the 123 min version, there wasn't a single person in my class that wasn't amazed by what they had just seen. It is an amazing story of the magic of film and the cinema, highlighted by great performances and some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen. There are very few films that I consider to be near-perfect, but the 123 min version of Cinema Paradiso has made that list. Some people complain that the 123 min version leaves a lot unanswered, but the beauty of it is that it doesn't matter. Though love and Toto's relationship with Elena are involved, they aren't the focus of the 123 min version. The focus of that version is on the relationship between Alfredo and Toto, and their shared love and enchantment with the cinema and film.\n\nIt is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in the director's cut. In attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions, the film is considerably bogged down by details and the magic and emotion of the 123 min version is lost. The focus of the entire story is shifted, and rather than solely being the story of the relationship between Toto and Alfredo, the film takes on the extra task of juggling the story of the relationship between Toto and Elena as well. In doing so, both storylines suffer, and the power the 123 min version holds is greatly reduced. The result is a complicated mess of answers (many of which only raise more questions), that after seeing leave you wishing you hadn't. In the end you crave for that initial sense of magic and emotion the 123 min version provided to come back, but for some it is all too late. I know it's tempting to watch the director's cut, but this is one occasion where you shouldn't indulge your curiosity. Sadly, the 170 min director's cut version taints the beauty and magic of the 123 min version of Cinema Paradiso, and that is one treasure that should never be lost."

        "review_detailed_main": "A filmmaker recalls his childhood, when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist.\n\nIn many ways, this film anticipates \"The Long Day Closes\" and \"Hugo\". While \"Cinema Paradiso\" is probably not the first movie about enjoying movies, it is easily the most successful and critically acclaimed. Terence Davies was likely influenced, and there is no doubt that Martin Scorsese was.\n\n\"Cinema Paradiso\" was shot in director Tornatore's hometown of Bagheria, Sicily, as well as Cefal\u00f9 on the Tyrrhenian Sea. This makes the film somewhat more interesting for Sicilians in Wisconsin, as they largely trace their roots to Bagheria. Myself, though not Sicilian, have extensively studied the Italians of Milwaukee and find this connection fascinating. (The Sicilian roots are explored a bit more on the Blu-ray in \"A Dream of Sicily\", which looks into the life of director Giuseppe Tornatore.)\n\nThe themes of the film are many, and go beyond the simple love of film or seeing film as a background of our lives (which is a feeling many cinephiles share). We have the role of religion, with some excessive priestly censorship of the films within the film, even cutting out a \"chaste kiss\".\n\nThere is the theme of the Mafia, which is unfortunately an ever-present aspect of the Sicilian way of life. We see that mob boss \"Don Vincenzo\" has complete control of employment (and an unusual rapport with Edward G. Robinson). Although he is not a major character, he plays an interesting role for being opposed by the village priest, and the way the populace accepts him is striking.\n\n\"Cinema Paradiso\" has countless nods to Fellini, quite possibly the biggest influence on Tornatore (and many other Italians). Interestingly, Fellini was going for \"realism\" (or neo-realism) in his work, and much of this film covers similar themes but plays them for laughs (at least in the first half). This is homage in its purest form -- taking a source and inverting, subverting it.\n\nThe film was rightly honored by many, not least of which was at the Academy Awards. What is most surprising is that the Criterion Collection did not scoop this title up years ago. But luckily for us, Arrow Academy is giving Criterion a run for their money and offers an impressive set for \"Paradiso\" fans. Both the theatrical cut and director's cut are in the set, providing an additional 50 minutes of footage, including a crucial romantic scene that is entirely excised in the shorter version.\n\nThe Arrow set also has \"A Dream of Sicily\", a 52-minute reflection on Tornatore's career, interviews with the key actors, a breakdown of the kissing montage, and more. Yale professor Millicent Marcus, who has authored many books on Italian cinema including \"Italian Film in the Shadow of Auschwitz\", provides a very insightful commentary (in English!), not only elucidating the finer points of the film, but pointing out connections to other, lesser-known works of Italian cinema."

People who say this is an ART movie, definitely never watched one in their lives. Because they can be awful to watch sometimes. But there are good things too. Anyway...\n\nUnfortunely, I bet many people didn\u00b4t went to see it because of this classification. You don\u00b4t know what you\u00b4re missing !\n\nCINEMA PARADISO, is, ( along with THE BIG BLUE ), my all time favorite movie ever, ( I can never choose between them ). It has the most beautiful story I\u00b4ve seen in a movie so far.\n\nMany people don\u00b4t like it, but I can bet those people don\u00b4t truly love cinema. They\u00b4re just ordinary movie goers who consume movies as fast food. Anyone who loves Cinema has to love CINEMA PARADISO !\n\nI used to think that italian movies were only those junk crap\n\nPseudo-erotic \" PORKYS \" style comedies or else those Art Films that the very intelligent Elite of film critics pretend to like, and so I only went to see CINEMA PARADISO, a few months after his release, because I was thinking that this would be one more of those.\n\nI was wrong. This is the most beautifuly filmed love story ever, on par only with CASABLANCA although in a very diferent style. It\u00b4s amazing how this movie by telling a love story and a life of a character in fact tells about the history of cinema itself. The use of the theater location as a conection between characters through out the years is magnificently done.\n\nAnd it has probably the most beautiful soundtrack ever !\n\nVery emotive and capturing perfectly the story in all its moments.\n\nAnd it has the most beautiful and moving ending ever filmed! No matter how many times we see this film. I bet everybody drops a tear at the end. And more than a tear, I\u00b4m sure. I do.\n\nThis is one of those rare moments in modern cinema that can\u00b4t be described. It has to be felt.\n\nThis movie is a true MASTERPIECE ! Please go and see it. It realy deserves not to be ignored.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and go see it.\n\nYou\u00b4ll never forget it. Believe me. It\u00b4s that good."

The picture does a great job in conveying the passage of time, with its eponymous picture-house going through as many - if not more - changes as its core characters. Though it does occasionally drag and, generally, has the tendency to meander, the experience is an oddly affecting one that remains engaging throughout. It has a palpable texture to it, too. Helped immensely by a stand-out (if somewhat repetitive) score from Ennio Morricone, the movie transports you to a distinct place and time in an almost melancholic way. It's by no means dour - in fact, it's often rather funny - but it definitely has more than tinge of regret to it. In the end, it can almost entirely be described as one thing: nostalgic. 7/10"

I actually sat through this monster twice and I can say that it doesn't even get any better the second time.\n\nThe theme of the movie (that is, maturing and allowing yourself to move on with your life, as opposed to the pretty picture movies portray) is admirable and comprehensible. However, there are some major problems that overwhelm this strength. First, the film is entirely too long. It feels like the director just tossed in every single \"growing up\" clich\u00e9 he could think of and the result is that the movie takes up waaaay too much of your life. Second, in spite of the first problem, this film has huge story gaps that took place as a result of massive editing (as I understand it, this film was originally well over three hours). Third, the film makes no real attempt to establish empathy with the audience. It instead makes the erroneous assumption that we will just see Alfred and Toto and be instantly smitten with these lovable characters. Wrong again. I too often found them annoying and ridiculous (especially Toto) to have any real emotional bonds with anyone.\n\nThe ending is decent, but it would have had more effect had all of the previous clutter not been strewn about the film. All in all, this was just way to mushy and bloated for me."

Since his childhood, Toto was fascinated by the movies and spent countless hours in the projection booth with Alfredo who had become the boy's friend and the mentor. After a fire blinds Alfredo, Toto becomes the projectionist, and the Cinema Paradiso continues to attract all villagers and to bring them together on Friday night to experience again and again the miracle of film. The boy's obsession with film becomes a lifelong love affair which will make him eventually a famous and successful filmmaker.\n\nDeceivingly simple and straightforward, the film is always moving, tender, touching, full of humor, love and compassion to its eccentric characters but what makes is special and unique, is the fact that we the viewers, all of us can and do relate to the story because we relive our own childhood movie experiences while watching the film. My memory took me many years and thousands miles back to the time when I was 5 and my grandmother took me to the theater for the first time. She later told me that she had been afraid that I would've became bored, restless, and started to cry - it never happened. I was so charmed and fascinated by what was happening on the huge screen that I sat not even moving, mesmerized and not uttering the single sound. Since that very moment, I have been always ready for the miracle to happen again. I expect every new movie to be great; I want to love, to cherish and to adore it. When it happens and the movie becomes mine, I am the happiest person in the Universe. It did happen tonight when I was watching Giuseppe Tarnatore's \"Cinema Paradiso\", one of the best films about the power, beauty, and magic of FILM ever made."

Believe or not, I couldn't help crying as a 41-year-old man to watch the epilogue every time. Yes, that is what I really do. The love theme by Morricone is the real masterpiece and surely gives me the highest emotional value between nostalgia and homesickness by touching me in the depth of my heart. If I want to cry to reduce my mental pressure ,I would watch it again and again .It was never on at the cinema or seldomly shown on TV in China ,but I believe that there are so many fans to raise it folk reputation from time to time."

The first time that I saw this was right after I had seen \"The Postman\", and I recognized him as the man who had played Pablo Neruda. Here, he plays an equally great role, of the operator of a camera in a movie theater in an Italian village in years past. His friendship with and advice to young Salvatore proves to be more than the boy could have ever dreamed about. In a sense, the movie seems to be a look not only at what Italy was, but also what going to the movies was. It's definitely a masterpiece that I recommend. There may be the issue of whether or not we should make Italy's past look so idealistic, given that Mussolini was in power at the time. But I would assert that this movie shows that even in times of oppression, people can find ways to escape it. A really good movie."

And, it is told so gently and affectionately that you can't help but love the film and the characters. The film is named after the local theater because it is the focal point for this community through the many years the film encompasses.

The musical score is emotional and romantic, and adds even more to the story. The story itself fulfills every expectation that a hopeless romantic could hope for. The ending has been mentioned repeatedly in other comments, but it's as memorable as what everyone praises it is.

        "review_detailed_main": "Emotions can make or break a film. Have too little, and your film has no weight and no importance. Have too much and your film will be unbelievable and schmaltzy. Giuseppe Tornatore's 1988 feature Cinema Paradiso definitely falls into the latter category. It's overflowing with forced emotions that take you out more than they invest you in. Nostalgia may have blinded some people from seeing this Oscar-winning film from what it really is, a manipulative and cliched tale that is never original or worthwhile of your time.\n\nWorld War II is still in full swing in the Italian countryside. The only kind of entertainment in town in the local cinema, Cinema Paradiso. Every night people arrive in droves to escape from the tragedies of reality. Out of all the attendees, the most passionate one is Toto. He's a young boy who has a passion for film and will do anything to learn more about it. Current projectionist Alfredo reluctantly takes him under his wing and begins to teach him the skills necessary to be a projectionist. From this point, Toto and Alfredo begin a lifelong friendship, one that we witness as the film tracks Toto's life from childhood to adult.\n\nCinema Paradiso is a very, very conventional film that never does anything out of the ordinary. Maybe that's why some people love it. It harkens back to the golden age of cinema, one filled with melodrama and two-bit characters. But for me, the nostalgia feels almost politically manipulative. It shows historical clips from old films that are supposed to make you feel good, which in turns makes you feel good about the film as a whole. It's the same technique used by any movie that includes a ton of pop culture references to try and win your emotional attachment. It feels forced and cheap, almost like the director doesn't trust his crew.\n\nThe film also overplayed its hand when it comes to delivering on the emotions. Nothing you feel is natural. Everything is presented with so much artificial drama and weight that it soon becomes tiresome to watch. It feels like a ploy by the director to get you to care about the film. It also feels so political and awards baity towards the Oscar voters. \"Look at how important cinema is!\" is the main message that is repeated numerous times, each times getting more and more irritating.\n\nEnnio Morricone is one of the greatest composers of all time, and he proves it here with a great theme. It has a classical and uplifting beat that perfectly captures the tone of the film. Unfortunately, Tornatore gives Morricone the ultimate disrespect by using so many times that it too becomes annoying to hear.\n\nOne positive that I can say is that the actors were quite good, especially the pair of Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio as Alfredo and young Toto, respectively. They have great chemistry and are able to carry the early parts of the film with ease.\n\nMarco Leonardi does a pretty good job as adolescent Toto. He mostly just coasts off his good looks, but he does bring some complexity to his character. He does struggle with the emotional bits however and comes off a bit too hammy.\n\nThis is one of the clearest cut cases of what a film did right and what it did wrong. The performances and music are all there, but the directing is atrocious and sinks everything. This would be a must-see film if a more serious director had taken the helm. Unfortunately, hindsight is 20/20 and what we are left with is a film that tries way too hard to make you care about what it wants to say."

The film is perfect from beginning to end with an outstanding musical score by Ennio Morricone to boot. Tornatore is the logical successor to DeSica as one of the greatest Italian directors of all time. The script and characters are unforgettable. Some of the scenes are painfully beautiful. Phillipe Noret is outstanding and Salvatore Cascio is perfectly cast. The older Salvatore is also extremely well-played. This is a moviegoer's delight of a film, and the finale is one you will never forget for the rest of your life."

If you love movies see this film, its a glorious tribute to life in the cinema, as maker, projector and most of all watcher. And I dare any truly diseased film lover to watch the film from start to finish and not cry at the end, that one sequence says more about what movies do for us than anything else. SEE THIS MOVIE."

'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso' or simply 'Cinema Paradiso' is spellbinding and absolutely heart-wrenching that is indeed a must-watch for any and every cinephile who has wondered what greatness in the medium truly means - well, look no further!\n\nI continue to be moved and deeply touched by this beautiful film from Italy, and I never tire of watching it. It shares the lives of Toto and Alfredo. It is about Toto who is a small Sicilian boy who loses his father in the Second World War and the older man Alfredo who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in a world of make-believe, movies and adventure. His dreams take him away from the small Sicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredo becomes for him a surrogate father, and the movies, his parallel existence.\n\nAn emotional journey of relationships, it is iconic cinema of the finest level. Young Salvatore Cascio is a marvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. Phillipe Noiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow up with Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns to the small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral. It is the story of life, lost love, devotion, friendship, and family. It is unforgettable."

At the end of the film he returns to his native village to attend the funeral of the man who had been his father figure. Such visits are unavoidably a disaoppointment, in this instance not in the last place because the cinema turns out to be in total decay. Two years later director Giuseppe Tornatore made \"Stanno Tutti bene / Everybody's fine\" (1990). In this film it is not the son from mainland Italy who visits his father(figure) in Sicily but the father from Sicily who visits his children in mainland Italy. In both cases the visits turn out to be a deception.\n\n\"Cinema paradiso\" won an Oscar for the best foreign language film. The film is all about nostalgia, but it treats this feeling in a very pleasant bittersweet way."

The best way to describe the kind of movie we're dealing with here is to say that if you liked \"Life Is Beautiful\" you will like \"Cinema Paradiso.\" People who don't like foreign movies like this one because, if you take away the Italian subtitles, this film is as fake and schlocky as the worst piece of sentimental clap-trap churned out by the Hollywood myth-making machine. Not one single moment of this movie rang true for me. Subtlety was passed over on every occasion for the the most manipulative of cinematic tricks, and the love story that anchors the film is boring and completely missing any sort of sexual spark.\n\nI have a feeling that this movie is so beloved because people who in reality have pretty low-brow movie tastes can watch it and feel like they're cinematically smarter. A double feature of this and \"Life Is Beautiful\" might just be enough to make me lose hope in serious film forever.\n\nGrade: D"

I had guessed the beginning but I didn't get the \"fine\".That's why it's such a great movie.\n\n\"The soldier stop waiting and go away at the very 99th day,when a day after he would probably have the princess' heart.\" Maybe sometimes the best thing to do is to walk away,leaving the memory lasting forever.The last fifty minutes of the movie,particularly I think, is the best part.The climax comes when the man and the woman meet each other again thirty years after their inevitable miss.I cant help burst into tears cause I can't hold it anymore after 2 hours' living together with the excellent characters.It's not until this day,by this movie that I am successfully convinced A man can really hold his love for as much as 30 years!\n\nLife is like a movie,but it's harder."

There is not too much drama, or humor, or mystery here, no tension, no brainstorming.

It is full of symbolism, but it is so lovely that I do not want to analyze it in any way. Just turn off the lights, sit back comfortably and enjoy your own experience of this timeless masterpiece.\n\n10/10."

As a young boy I went to the movie theater with my Mom every Friday afternoon at the Lefferts Theater on Liberty Ave., in Richmond Hill, N.Y. and grew to love all the films just as the young boy in this film. It is very easy to see why this film received so much wonderful praise and awards. There was plenty of funny comedy when the Roman Catholic Priest censored all the films shown in the theater that showed any form of kissing or physical contact between a male or female. It was a great down to earth film which words cannot describe fully, and can only be appreciated by people who love to escape into the World of Film and stories. The Actors, Producers and Directors out did themselves with this great masterpiece of JOY. By the way, when I attended those Friday afternoon showing of films with Mom, she also received a free plate or dish to go with her set of matching dinner dishes."

This is a film about love, passion, and time. It beautifully and tragically conveys how life waits for no one, eventually, everything you hold dear becomes a ghost of the past, and all you have left are memories, as Toto's mother so eloquently puts it. I just viewed this with my elderly father, and I couldn't help but see myself in Toto and him in Alfredo, we share a love of films and have watched countless of them together throughout the years, so watching this really made me emotional.\n\nThis truly is a masterclass in filmmaking, I've always considered that for a film to be great, it must have the ability to make you FEEL, and Cinema Paradiso does just that. I know this movie is hard to find, and if you're not fluent in Italian, it may feel like a turnoff to have to read subtitles the entire time, but I implore everyone who reads this review to watch this movie if the opportunity arises, the ending (which I won't spoil) will leave you stunned, and I guarantee that you will have a viewing experience that changes the way you view life, if ever so slightly."

        "review_title": "Tedious beyond belief",
        "review_detailed_main": "I really don't understand how this film got to be so famous and widely recommended. Two hours of clumsy sentimentality, in which nothing happens; a coming-of-age tale which tackles none of the problems of adolescence; characters who spend most of their time simpering over each other, yet they never bother trying to make them connect with the viewer; child acting so dreadful a wooden puppet with its strings cut would have been a better replacement...\n\nI resent the laziness of the film, they thought they could rely on its magic formula of nostalgia, saccharine and being foreign so they thought \"we don't need to bother building up any genuine feeling for these characters\". The story starts with an incorrigible young tyke (who i found extremely irritating) befriending the local projectionist. That's about all you need to know, what there is of a plot that develops from there doesn't really matter - it doesn't offer any interest, it doesn't put any of the characters in a dilemma, it all just dissolves into the steady flow of sap. With a plot development occurring every twenty minutes or so, thank God that we're anchored to the motif of the cinema by lengthy footage of people sitting around in it, making entertaining comments which make us just resonate with the warmth of the Italian people. More sugar anyone? Perhaps if I had a very fragile and elderly relative - I mean several centuries old - for whom trying to follow a plot that wasn't totally linear might get their blood up, who was too mentally impaired to take a character at anything but face value, for whom nuanced was just a seven letter word they weren't sure how to spell, then I might recommend to them Cinema Paradiso. Although the possibility that their heart might stop mid-way through, making me culpable for their death, would make me think twice. In fact I think I've got it, Cinema Paradiso might be a very good film to die to. Especially if you've been incapacitated waiting to die for a very long time, and would like to assure yourself that other people have been subjected to something of what you're going through.\n\nThe Spirit of the Beehive (La Esp\u00edritu de la Colmena) is sometimes presented as Cinema Paradiso gone right, again centred on a cinema in a small town and a child's reaction to it. Sure it's slow, and makes no concessions to commercialism, but it is beautifully directed and in an understated way develops the viewer's empathy for the characters. Exactly the opposite of the crass tedium of the film I've just had the misfortune to see."

Much emotion throughout the film and at the near end a scene that leaves you weeping with joy and sadness at the same time. No spoilers here. Enjoy for yourself.

Its cinema that lets me explore different lives through its portrayal. I simply know that I love cinema and I love every bit of it with all my life.\n\nCinema Paradiso is such a relevant film to me because I think I and Toto truly share the same love for cinema. Every cinema is like a new wonderful adventure. Like him, I too have memorized numerous dialogues of different films all over my life. Cinema simply works like magic on us.\n\nThe film not only shows Toto and his love for cinema, it also portrays his complete life. It's also so much relevant, because it's an ordinary life. \"Life isn't like in the movies. Life... is much harder.\"- Life lessons, taken from the cinema, just like Alfredo.\n\nI just finished watching this film and sat to write this review. It's getting longer than expected.

With the help of the local theatre projectionist, Alfredo, he is able to recognize his potential and move out into a wider world. But what keeps this film from simply being a sentimental ode to Italian cinema, is the reflection of a much older Toro coming to terms with the sacrifices he has made to become the man he is. Were they mistakes? Or are his past regrets still threatening to cloak his accomplishments as an individual?\n\nDespite a somewhat obtrusive score by Ennio Morriconne, this film sends a strong message about life reevaluation, and how past decisions can segue into the present, in often unexpected, but beautiful ways. A small gem of a film."

The plot, beside the originality, is not specially good and develops very slow. Sadness is always present. But... The timing is awful. No reason for such a long movie. They are no stuff to maintain your attention during 3 hours. It could be much better if a Director Cut put it to 100 minutes, no more. Its boring. The advises from Alfredo are unrealistic and the broken contact between the lovers hard to understand. I rate it with 6 points."

Stupid unbelievable characters and then a fairly tame soap opera story. Where was the depth, where was the profound message, basically there wasn't one.\n\nIn the end this could have easily been produced by Hollywood. There was a real sense of passion missing. Toto wanted to be a film maker, but didn't really demonstrate his passion for films other than wanting to be a projectionist. Tag on a predictable love story and a bit of sentimentality, that seemed out of place. What was the big deal, yes people liked the cinema house, but I can't say they felt any true love for it. Then at the end you see this scene of great nostalgia, which seemed out of place.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't like it, I genuinely thought I would, but the film really missed any maturity and lacked any real sentiment."

        "review_detailed_main": "I first saw this movie back in 1988 in Italy, when it came out there. Back here in the States, I must have seen it several dozen times, in theaters and on VHS tape. It is not a \"feel good movie\" - thank God - but it always overwhelmed me emotionally.\n\nI saw it again tonight on TCM, for the first time in 20-some years, and found that I still remembered many of the lines. I almost always knew what was coming next, what would be said next.\n\nAnd I found that I still find it profoundly moving.\n\nIt is the story of a man who grows up in love with two people, the projectionist at the movie theater in his small Sicilian town, and later, a beautiful young woman who arrives for a few years in his town and then leaves.\n\nBoth, in different ways, leave him searching for love in a very idealized form, a form that he cannot, for obvious reasons, find in his adult life.\n\nAnd so he goes from one empty relationship to another, all the while making what are evidently very successful movies, though we never find out what they are about.\n\nWhen he comes back to his small town, after having been away many years, he sees how small-town life in rural Italy has changed. But he does not really seem to learn how his fascination with romantic movies has impeded his own emotional development.\n\nThat sounds very dour, which this movie is not. It is, in fact, a warm-hearted and wonderful film about life in small-town Italy after World War II.\n\nI cannot recommend it too highly. It is one of the most profoundly moving films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.\n\nA note: the 124-minute version shown on TCM tonight, which is the version I saw many times here in the States in theaters and on VHS, is substantially shorter than the original Italian version, which was at one point released in this country as the \"director's cut.\" I haven't seen that in years, but as I recall, it made certain scenes in the movie more understandable. It's worth searching out, as I recall, but I will admit that I found parts of it too slow."

A film catches fire burning down the cinema and blinding Alfredo. Toto runs in to save Alfredo's life. The cinema is rebuild and Toto becomes the new projectionist. As a teen, he would find love and lose love. The adult Salvatore returns to town to attend Alfredo's funeral. The cinema is demolished. In Alfredo's home, he finds an unexpected film reel.\n\nI love the childhood Toto. The kid is precocious and charming. His chemistry with Philippe Noiret is wondrous. The teenage years are less kind. The teen Toto isn't as charismatic and the teenage love isn't anything special. Then there is the final film clips. It is some kind of movie magic.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is such a difficult film to describe in words because all of it is heartfelt emotion. However, it must be noted that the three central performances are beyond reproach: the child Salvatore (played with rascally charm by Salvatore Cascio), the brusque projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) and the adolescent Salvatore (Marco Leonardi). All three are masterful in creating the viewer's emotional attachment to these characters. The relationship between the tough but tender projectionist and the little boy is what carries the first half of the film and it continues when the boy becomes a lovesick adolescent. It is only the last half of the film that seems to drag a little with scenes of the adult Salvatore (Jacques Perrin)contemplating returning to the little village where he grew up in the shadows of the movie theater and those wonderful silver shadows on the screen.\n\nAll of the scenes involving the movie theater and its rowdy audiences are wonderfully realized with crude humor and insight into the kind of characters who thrived on whatever entertainment films could offer. Ennio Morriconne's music is charming throughout, always totally in keeping with the images on screen and the intentions of the story.\n\nBy all means, well worth seeing and treasuring as one of the great foreign films to come out of the 1980s. I watched the abbreviated version on TCM which comes to a little more than two hours and is the version shown in the U.S. theatrically."

This film is a fantastic trip into the world of 35mm cinema and its rippling effects throughout Europe post-World-War-Two.\n\nIt's a great slice of 1980s cinema that you'd expect Hollywood to have remade a dozens times by now: thankfully this is not the case here and this movie is an experience that remains untainted by America's 'remake syndrome'. It's a love story about a little Italian town and it's theatre: the Cinema Paradiso. And like the films they watch the audience themselves all have their own stories to tell. It all centres around Alfredo's movie theatre and his raising of Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita through the magic of movies via 35mm-cinema projection.\n\nIt's a coming-of-age story about cinema's wisdom and charm rather than the cynicism of the film industry: it's got a heart-warning vibe to it throughout its two-hour+ runtime (depending on whether you've seen the theatrical, or the near-three-hour extended, cut of the movie) and it's one any self-professed cinephile MUST watch!\n\nIt's an example of European cinema that's artistically expressive and surprisingly accessible to more mainstream audiences. It's a zeitgeist movie of the 80s. 5/5 stars."

If you enjoy making films then you will find yourself identified with this, but that doesn't make it a masterpiece like everyone says it does.\n\nThe relationship between Alfredo and the boy never feels natural. He didn't seem to teach him that much or show him a lot of appreciation, yet we are told that they love each other. All the other relationships in the movie are the exact same, never quite completed. The good soundtrack and some very good scenes make up for all the dullness enough to give it a 6.\n\nSo if you say this is one of your favorites movies Im fine with that, but you shouldn't really call it a great movie.

The film was fascinating, I watched it with the kind of reverence children save for The Teletubbies. I watched the film and it opened within me a new kind of person, someone who won't give up, someone who is constantly trying to get better at something. But the part of the film that struck me most was the part when Toto returns home and goes into his bedroom and we see his first film reel, the pictures of the young Toto and Alfredo. It's like Alfredo was almost a father figure for Toto. That's the only part of the film that made me cry.\n\nAnother similar film I saw recently was \"A Touch Of Spice\", a Greek film that my sister brought home. It is also very heart-wrenching film, much like Cinema Paradiso, but with a different storyline. I highly recommend this film; but I won't talk about it any more and spoil it! Cinema Paradiso is honestly one of the best films I have ever seen, something Hollywood has really got to learn from.\n\nThe thing that makes a good film is emotion, not special effects or famous actors or actresses."

        "review_detailed_main": "*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nIt would be best to see this film without knowing how warmly it was welcomed by critics and viewers at the time, or how many people still take it to their hearts. It does hold many charms in its details, but when it tries to give us a story of Life and Love it becomes banal and contrived. It also takes an oddly careless approach to the aging of its characters.\n\nNuovo Cinema Paradiso opens with a framing story in which a middle-aged man hears that someone named Alfredo has died in his hometown and begins recalling his childhood. In the flashbacks that form the main body of the film, the setting is a town in Sicily in the decade following World War II. A small boy is irresistibly drawn to the local cinema, a world of enchantment, and to its projection booth, the heart of that world. He befriends the projectionist, Alfredo. Alfredo discourages the boy, Toto, from following in his footsteps as a projectionist and eventually encourages him to pursue his love of movies on a grander scale. We're soon prepared to learn that the grown Toto who is recollecting these things has become a famous director.\n\nIn the first phase of the flashbacks, we follow little Toto in his childish peccadilloes while following the community in its avid response to movie magic (a funny exception being the gritty social realism of post-war Italian cinema, which proves as impenetrable to Sicilians as to much of the world beyond). This phase ends with the cinema destroyed by fire and Alfredo rescued by Toto but blinded for life.\n\nThe Toto of the second phase is apparently in his late teens, perhaps twenty by the end of the flashback. Childish peccadilloes have given way to amateur film-making, running the projector at the rebuilt cinema, and love at first sight with a girl whose social position poses an obstacle -- in effect, a princess. As always, the life of the community and that of the film are centered on the shared joys of escape in a darkened cinema. Toto's personal life is disrupted by a period of military training, after which he finds that he can't pick up where he left off. He loses touch with Elena, his love, who has moved away. Finally, he takes Alfredo's advice and leaves town himself to make his way in the world.\n\nVery well, but it's unbelievable that he then absolutely neglects his mother for thirty years, even to the point of not returning her phone calls, although they were on good terms when he left. The only reason seems to be that the film requires a complete break with home so that the middle-aged Toto can feel he's stepping into a past world when he returns for Alfredo's funeral. Still more unbelievable is the casting of characters at different ages. The twentyish Toto is distinctly short, but the fiftyish Toto towers over everyone else in the funeral procession. Conversely, his mother changes from a tall young woman to a tiny old one. Then there is the aging of characters who are played by the same actors throughout. Alfredo's wife, who was middle-aged in the first place, only turns gray-haired and gray-faced while the transformation (by casting) of Toto's younger mother rivals that of the queen in Snow White. Indeed, slapping gray paint on actors -- while removing an obvious hairpiece from one -- is all the movie magic Tornatore offers in the framing story. Is he trying to tell us that he has decided to wash his hands of film-making as a labor of love?\n\nThe many delightful moments in Nuovo Cinema Paradiso are really just so many vignettes strung together in the abrupt, sometimes bewildering manner of the 1980s. To the extent that these moments achieve a unified effect, they suggest the benign human comedy of Rene Clair. Yet they are mixed with stink-bombs of bad taste that would have puzzled Clair as to this director's intent. That, too, is a mark of the 1980s.\n\nIt may be best to look for the appeal of this film in the ways in which it differs from most other films of the 1980s and many since. It does come down on the side of benign human comedy. It does cherish the magic of Golden Age film-making, even as that magic slips through its fingers. It does become an oasis of entertainment if you come upon it in a personal desert of dissatisfaction with films generally. The trouble is that if you have had the good fortune to drink from the springs of Rene Clair and other masters, Nuovo Cinema Paradiso turns out to be a mirage."

Imagine the syrupy sweet drivel from a Hallmark greeting card commercial. Now repeat it for 2 hours. Now shoot yourself in the head. For 2 hours.\n\nNext let's talk about plot. It indeed has a plot, but not one worthy of 2 hours of your life. Unless you have no life. In which case, I repeat: shoot yourself in the head asap.\n\nLastly, let's talk theme. Major strikeout. This film had so much potential; the metaphor of a lonely projectionist was brilliant. But instead of boldly proceeding with that challenging idea, the film spiralled into a morass of lukewarm humor, unconvincing romance and unconnected randomness. Fans of Virginia Woolf (stream-of-consciousness) may love this film. (But didn't Ms. Woolf end up shooting herself in the head? Hm, I sense a trend...)\n\nI could've spent 2 hours listening to Kenny G and watching a Nat'l Geographic documentary on corn instead."

Alfredo becomes more like a father figure to Toto since his father died in World War II. We watch Sal's life as reflects upon the loss of Alfredo. The film has a great cast and crew. It's absolutely heartbreaking by the end. The cast is superb with Jacques Perrin as the older Sal. I don't cry but I did today. It takes a lot for me to cry.

I prefer passion to money... sure this movie will give you much more true feelings and brain food. Please, if you have the time rent it.

Yet only Morricone's soundtrack is remarkable. Emotional catharsis is induced in a manipulative way, as an exercise in nostalgia. Originally a two-part film running about three hours, it was been reduced by almost a third, though it still seemed to run on forever . No, they don't make Italian movies like they used to, this Oscar-winning production spends the better part of three hours proving it. A little inspiration is not enough to carry a whole feature; along with the tears, it leaves us with an aftertaste of phoniness."

        "review_detailed_main": "I knew the film was held in high regard, and I went in with very high expectations.\n\nThis is an incredible piece of cinema.\n\nThe score/theme-music is perhaps Ennio Morricone's(Untouchables Etc) best, and that's saying something. It's only one of many fantastic characteristics that tie this whole thing together.\n\n\"Cinema Paradiso\" seems like such a simple story, but nothing about the questions it asks about fate, love and friendship are simple.\n\nAnd that's what I really love about this story. It's realistic, heartbreaking, and uplifting all at the same time. The audience mimics the characters here. There are many things that you would like to change. How many times have you asked yourself if you would do it differently if you had it all over to do again? Could you? No. It's the way it happened. It's life. You can only piece together the moments of joy and happiness and reflect... hope.\n\nwhat a fantastic film!\n\nYou'll like this if you liked: A Very Long Engagement(not quite as excellent), Hugo(a clear notch below and it borrowed a ton from this), or Cast Away(not as good, very similar themes in both films' last 30 min).\n\nthis review is of the 3hr director's cut, not the theatrical release... I couldn't imagine it any other way. Will view it though.\n\nLate Edit(after viewing the shorter, original theatrical version): IMO.. the extended cut is far more powerful. The love story and the journey of the lead character is more complete, and ultimately, I find the extended cut to be much better. That's the version I would recommend to the first time viewer - although I seem to be in the minority on this subject."

Other than having a beautiful story about childhood, cinema and love, it plays with every emotion in your body and therefore I will never forget this experience.\n\nThe soundtrack is perfectly executed and makes every scene stronger and more emotional.\n\nBeing an Italian movie, I had my doubts. But if this took place in any other country, this story wouldn't make sense. The atmosphere of a small town in Italy makes this story stronger and I believe that this wouldn't work if it was set in America for example.\n\nI think that this is a perfectly executed film and it has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.\n\nTruly beautiful.\n\nPlease watch this film, please experience this journey.

        "review_detailed_main": "Cinema Paradiso is a film that celebrates the magic of cinema and the power of nostalgia. Directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, the film tells the story of Salvatore, a successful film director who returns to his hometown in Sicily after hearing the news of the death of his old friend and mentor, Alfredo, the projectionist of the local movie theater.\n\nThrough flashbacks, we see how Salvatore, as a young boy and then a teenager, developed a passion for movies and a close bond with Alfredo, who taught him everything he knew about film and life. We also witness the joys and sorrows of Salvatore's childhood and adolescence, his first love, his family troubles, and his dreams of becoming a filmmaker.\n\nCinema Paradiso is a film that touches the heart and the soul of anyone who loves movies. It is a tribute to the golden age of cinema, when films were not only a form of entertainment, but also a source of inspiration, education, and escape. The film is full of references and homages to classic films, from Chaplin to Fellini, from Westerns to melodramas. The film also shows the impact of cinema on the lives of the people in the small town, who gathered at the theater to laugh, cry, and cheer together, forming a community and a culture.\n\nThe film is also a poignant exploration of the themes of memory, loss, and change. As Salvatore grows up, he has to face the reality of leaving his hometown, his friends, and his past behind. He also has to cope with the changes in the film industry, as television and censorship threaten the existence of the old movie theater. The film asks us what we gain and what we lose when we pursue our dreams, and how we can preserve the memories that shaped us.\n\nThe film is enhanced by the superb performances of the actors, especially Philippe Noiret as Alfredo, the wise and witty projectionist who becomes a father figure to Salvatore, and Salvatore Cascio and Marco Leonardi as the young and teenage Salvatore, who portray his innocence, curiosity, and ambition with charm and authenticity. The film also features a beautiful and haunting score by Ennio Morricone, who captures the mood and the emotion of the film with his music.\n\nCinema Paradiso is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and smile. It is a film that will make you fall in love with cinema all over again. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is, simply, a masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie should be watched especially by film lovers. The movie \"Cinema Paradiso,\" directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, has made the audience tearful and left a memorable impact.\n\nDirector Giuseppe Tornatore has depicted beautiful scenes where cinema portrays various emotions in human life such as joy, sadness, anger, and love. The story revolves around Salvatore, a film director, who discovers that his old friend Alfredo, a film projectionist at a local theatre, has passed away. Salvatore reminisces about the strong bond of friendship he shared with Alfredo, and his love for film since childhood. The moments they spent together, and Alfredo's guidance in the theatre, taught Salvatore the joy of filmmaking. The film's portrayal of comedy, tears, and other emotions makes it particularly captivating.\n\nThe cinematography, handled excellently by Blasco Giurato, showcases the beauty of the Sicilian town both indoors and outdoors. The camera work, including tracking shots through the bell tower and wide-angle lens perspectives, adds depth to the scenes. The imagery of the bell ringing in the square symbolizes authority and influence over the people, enhancing the visual storytelling, especially in the landscape moments.\n\nGiven that \"Cinema Paradiso\" relies heavily on flashbacks experienced by the adult Toto, the lighting and color scheme vary to reflect his emotions. Subdued lighting and cooler colors convey melancholy and depression, helping viewers empathize with the character's experiences.\n\nI must emphasize that \"Cinema Paradiso\" is the most memorable foreign film (Italian) I have ever watched. As a film lover and filmmaker, I urge everyone interested in foreign cinema to not miss this film, as it beautifully captures the essence of entertainment and life lessons through cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "It seems there are twos aspects of this film that appeal to many people's emotions.\n\n1) Nostalgia: After thirty years of time during which Toto kept himself physically and mentally away from home, it is understandable that the memories from the distant past flood into Toto, although personally I did not feel particularly nostalgic by watching that.\n\n2) Love: According to many, the ending is meant to fill Toto with love he lost, but this interpretation is not plausible because it refers to different kinds of love. After his loss of relationship with Elena, Toto left home and had relationships with many women in search for a better heterosexual love, while the ending scene only means Alfredo's paternal love. These two are qualitatively different; the latter kind of love cannot be taken to compensate for the missing former. Considering the special emotional attachment given by Toto to Elena, it is implausible that Toto finds any true love with any other woman, which is precisely why he has had many relationships ever since he lost Elena. An interpretation of the ending scene as a demonstration of the former (heterosexual) kind of love is also implausible, because it is only a film projected on the screen, not real for Toto himself. In a shorter version of this film at least, therefore, Toto is left with Alfredo's enduring paternal love but without heterosexual love with a woman. This aspect is incomplete.\n\nThese two aspects were emotionally not convincing to me. Perhaps all I need to appreciate its true value is a couple of more decades of life experience, long enough to look far back into the past and be nostalgic. For the time being, 6 out of 10."

I feel a bit embarrassed for watching cinema paradiso just now, but it's better late than never!\n\nThe first time of many, i'll rewatch this movie as many times i can. This is a love letter to film lovers, i felt represented by Tot\u00f3, someone who had the same obsession as i do, i'ts impressive how movies can be so touching beign simple, like this one is. Nothing more than a great idea, deep, well written, beautifully shot and incredibly portraited by those amazing actors that brought the beautiful and well developed characters to life. Funny scenes and dramatic heartbreaking ones too.\n\nMy weakness, and what made me love this one even more is simply being italian. I love the language as much as i love the country and it's beautiful and rich culture! Wouldn't be the same if it weren't italian.\n\nEnio Morricone, as aways a master. Did an amazing job in the tracks, got chills just by remembering.\n\nIo sono un pazzo come Tot\u00f3!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you love movies you owe it yourself to see \"Cinema Paradiso\" made by the Sicilian director Giuseppe Tornatore. It contains about everything that the cinema is about (or maybe better: once was), and more. Tornatore also wrote the screenplay for this film and it can be felt throughout that the material comes from his heart, drawing from own experiences and those related to him - the director even has a cameo appearance as a projectionist in the final minutes. \"Cinema Paradiso\" is as powerful as it is not only because of its topic, the direction and the screenplay, but also because of its scope - spanning the whole lifetime of the main character -, its memorable imagery, Ennio Morricone's brilliant score and of course the carefully chosen cast headed by Philippe Noiret. By the way: Even grandmaster Fellini might have made it into the movie, intended for the role of the mentioned projectionist at the very end. But he replied to the director's request: \"At such an important part of the movie putting a face so bulky like mine could be distracting to the audience. I suggest an unknown person instead: Let Tornatore do it!\" Well, so we've still got a master of cinema up there at least - the one who made \"Cinema Paradiso\".\n\nTo sum it up: Here we have not just any film about the cinema, it's the definitive one - and in the 50 minutes longer director's cut an already great experience becomes perfect. If you are reading reviews like this and still haven't seen it, you better finish this sentence and then be off to get it. Quick!"

The character of the Mediterranean, the lives and loves of ordinary people but seen through the eyes of one. The sets are wonderfully charming, the comedy and tragedy of life unfolding in much the same way as a cinema reel. I found myself welling up on several occasions and wanting to know more. How would this story unfold? How would the passions be released? The complexity and depth of maternal and paternal love is evident and the simple joys of life presented, from the cheeky young boy wanting to know more about cinema (about life really) to the older, wiser maybe, but still passionate, middle-aged man. An astonishingly beautiful film."

No journey is as beautiful, fun and sorrowful as Paradiso. Paradiso is the greatest ode to cinema I have watched, there is no greater homage to cinema than Paradiso. I love cinema, I love the movies and big picture and movie can express this love better than Paradiso.\n\nIts character are you and me and yet they are larger than life. And the acting that brings these to life, oh they are magnificent. I cannot find the words to describe how truly good the cast is, I feel as if no praise to them and to Paradiso would be enough. Salvatore Cascio who plays young To, well shines and acts better, at such a small age, than most most actors in their life hopes to.\n\nI could go on and on dissecting and prasiny every frame and aspect of Paradiso and I still feel it would not be enough. So my final message and what I to shout to every corner of the world and to anyone who can listen to is: Please watch Nuovo Cinema Paradiso!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is one of the most touching works of nostalgia out there. It starts off showing the life of a young boy in an Italian town who befriends the projectionist of the local cinema. This part of the film is very sweet and is full of little moments like the town bonding, the boy sneaking into the projection room, the projectionist talking about his life and more. This all gives a well-rounded view of the boy's life and environment, which feels warm and true to life. The acting of the boy and the projectionist must be commended for a sense of genuine warmth. After a time skip, the young boy becomes a young man who takes over the projection booth. By this point, the repetition of the extended director's cut really starts to show badly. His desperate attempts at romance come across as annoying to watch. This really leads to confusion by the next time skip when she happily reunites with him. It seems that not only the past is presented as a fantastical fairytale, but also the \"present\". No amount of nostalgic rose-tinted glasses can resolve this incongruity."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Cinema Paradiso\" is a love letter to cinema that transcends the screens and delves deeply into the memories of a young man passionate about the seventh art. Giuseppe Tornatore skillfully weaves a tapestry of nostalgia and emotion, guiding the viewer through a journey along the dusty streets of a small Sicilian town.\n\nAt the heart of this narrative is Toto, a young man full of curiosity and vitality, whose fate intertwines with that of the solitary projectionist Alfredo. Philippe Noiret brings this character to life with a melancholic gravity, while Toto is portrayed at different stages of his life, each bringing unique nuances to his journey.\n\nThe magic of cinema is captured in the profound relationship between Toto and Alfredo, a friendship that flourishes in the shadows of the Cinema Paradiso's projection booth. Together, they face the challenges of censorship and adversity, defending the art that unites them and transforming a simple cinema into a sanctuary of dreams and memories.\n\nTornatore's stunning cinematography transports the viewer to sunny Sicily, where the aromas and colors of everyday life come to life before our eyes. Ennio Morricone's emotive soundtrack elevates each scene to new heights of beauty and emotion, evoking a sense of longing and enchantment.\n\nMore than just a narrative about cinema, \"Cinema Paradiso\" is an ode to humanity. It's about the bonds that unite us, about the moments that define our lives, and about cinema's ability to transport us beyond time and space. It's a masterpiece of Italian cinema, a celebration of art, and a reminder that even in the darkest hours, cinema shines as a beacon of hope and redemption."

        "review_detailed_main": "Cinema Paradiso is a movie about a little boy who works in a theater with an old man, to put it in a short summary. There are several positive aspects of this movie, but also a few negatives.\n\nCinema Paradiso is very simplistic. It isn't overly complicated, so it is relaxing to watch. It didn't try to be more than it was. The acting by the older man and the young boy Toto (and teenager when he is older) is well done. The ending scene could not have been more perfect to close the film.\n\nThe main problem I had with this film was the actor who played the adult version of Toto. He looked nothing like the child or teenage version of Toto, so it threw me off a bit. Also, some parts of the film were much too slow or pointless and could have been cut out. The overall running time was a tad too long to keep the movie interesting.\n\nCinema Paradiso is a nice, if somewhat forgettable, film that I think most would enjoy watching. It is far from any sort of masterpiece, but its innocence and view on life are to be admired."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story follows Salvatore, a successful filmmaker who reflects on his formative years spent in a small Italian village and his friendship with the local movie theater projectionist, Alfredo. Through a series of flashbacks, we witness their bond and the profound impact cinema had on Salvatore's life.\n\nAt its core, \"Cinema Paradiso\" is a celebration of the magic and communal experience of cinema. It beautifully portrays the way movies can transport us to different worlds, evoke powerful emotions, and serve as a universal language that brings people together. The film captures the enchantment of sitting in a dark theater, the flickering of the projector, and the collective joy and laughter shared by the audience.\n\nThe performances in \"Cinema Paradiso\" are exceptional, with Jacques Perrin and Philippe Noiret delivering heartfelt portrayals as the older and younger Salvatore, respectively. Their chemistry and the genuine warmth they bring to their roles create a strong emotional connection with the audience. The supporting cast also shines, adding depth and authenticity to the village community.\n\nThe film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the story to unfold gradually and capturing the nuances of daily life in the village. The narrative is richly layered, blending elements of coming-of-age, romance, and nostalgia. It explores themes of friendship, love, loss, and the sacrifices we make for our passions.\n\nVisually, \"Cinema Paradiso\" is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography beautifully captures the idyllic Italian countryside and the nostalgic charm of the village. The use of light and color enhances the film's emotional impact, evoking a sense of longing and melancholy.\n\nOne of the film's strengths lies in its evocative score composed by Ennio Morricone. The music perfectly complements the storytelling, enhancing the emotions and creating a lasting impression. The iconic main theme, \"Love Theme from Cinema Paradiso,\" is both haunting and nostalgic, evoking a deep sense of longing.\n\n\"Cinema Paradiso\" is a timeless masterpiece that celebrates the power of cinema to shape our lives, ignite our imagination, and forge profound connections. Through its heartfelt story, superb performances, and evocative imagery, it captures the essence of the cinematic experience and leaves a lasting impression on its viewers. It is a love letter to the magic of movies and a reminder of the profound impact they can have on our lives."

        "review_title": "Truly cinema paradise",
        "review_detailed_main": "I will start by saying that this is now one of my favourite films, and you will quickly find out why.\n\nBefore I say anything: do not be deterred by the long runtime. The pacing is done so well that you will not feel it at all.\n\nIt isn't as much how the film is made (even though that is still amazing), but what it is about, which I'd say is especially these things: life in general, how a love for something can bring about great dedication, and of course, traditional cinema. While this might be quite clich\u00e9, it does bring about a feeling for 'simpler' times, although only really at the start when Toto is a young boy and a little less when he is a teenager. In fact, this illusion is shattered when Toto returns for Alfredo's funeral - he says that he doesn't recognise anyone or anything and has experienced life to be hard and complicated, like Alfredo told him. His initial dream as a boy was to work the projector, but as he grows up, he realises he can do a lot more - and he does.\n\nEven the most minor of characters are well written. Each scene with the cinema is amazingly lively, punctuated by an interesting action done by some unnamed member of the village: the man who falls asleep with his mouth agape, the man who spits onto the people below him from the balcony, the man who went to see the film while leaving his sick wife in bed. With just one simple action, they are each given more life than if the camera were to pan to a variety of people simply watching the films, even if they were to each have a unique look on their faces. These scenes also add some excellent comedy that even seems realistic. No doubt, after years of being spat on, the men below would retort with what is at its nicest a chocolate mousse to the face. Of course, these kinds of action would be viewed as hooliganism if done in a cinema today, but this liveliness from all of the audience makes every one of these scenes enjoyable. The two biggest characters are Toto and his mentor Alfredo. Even though we know Alfredo isn't the smartest of people, he is kind and passionate when teaching Toto how to operate the projector. This is returned by Toto when he helps Alfredo as a teenager, but now he has also outgrown his status as a student, and is now more like a friend, while Alfredo is more like a father too.\n\nThis film is also emotionally moving. You could go from scenes of deep sadness to intense comedy and your facial muscles feel compelled to move as if controlled by external strings. This is done throughout, although near the end there is more of a melancholy feeling, with nostalgia scattered in.\n\nJust to make this a fair review, I will include some things that were flaws. The clearest of these is the differences between the actors/actresses playing Toto and his mother. I'd say the best of the ones playing Toto was Salvatore Cascio as child Toto, he was incredibly skilled for his age. Another is a lack of focus on Toto's sister, who doesn't do much except hang around in a few frames and speak a few words even though she should have been much more influential in Toto's life. Arguably, this would have added extra runtime and maybe thrown off the pacing, but that's just something I noticed.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful film that is emotionally moving, well made and certainly makes you think about life, and what you want to dedicate yourself to. I'm sure plenty of us could do with someone like Alfredo, or even just his advice."

Certain films become something that turns your eyes from just watching it play out, to experiencing the film through your entire emotional state. I guess what I mean is that Cinema Paradiso to me meant more than just another film. It made me feel unlike I ever had before. It's one of the best films for pure film buffs. Not only is it a deeply emotional experience but it's also a joy to watch.\n\nIt tells the story of Toto, a famous filmmaker who looks back on his time growing up at a local movie theater and his deep bond with the theaters projectionist, Alfredo. There are plenty of great unlikely relationships in movies but none really moved me as much as Toto and Alfredo's. Even with the actor who played Alfredo having to develop chemistry with three different actors who portrayed Toto, it works. There's something to be said about that person in your life, family or not, who inspires you to become who you are and teaches you the do's and don'ts of life. Alfredo was that to Toto. As much as I loved that aspect of the movie, I was surprised to see just how well they were able to tell the history of film as well. Whether it was the film that burned, the excessive censorship, or all of the famous movie plus and references throughout, it was a masterful directing job.\n\nThe film is also complimented by an all time great score and main theme. Most notably as Toto goes through his memories back at the Paradiso. A subtle romance story with Toto and Elena is also worth mentioning. It's just one of those movies that impacts you more than you think. I don't why it took me so long to actually watch the film. It's a great bittersweet story.\n\n+Father-son bond\n\n+Perfect for die-hard movie lovers\n\n+Score\n\n+Balances everything really well\n\n9.6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Filmmakers often possess a deeper passion that is noticeably reflected in their work. However, there is one passion that all directors inevitably share, and that is for cinema itself. Films like Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)' and, more recently, Michel Gondry's 'Be Kind Rewind (2008),' exhibit such affection towards movies and movie-making that no film-lover can help but like them. In 1988, Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore released 'Nuovo cinema Paradiso / Cinema Paradiso,' his personal ode to the magic of movies and the humble small-town cinema. After a poor local performance, the film was sheered down to 123 minutes (from 155 minutes), and subsequently went on to win both the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar. In 2002, a 170-minute director's cut {marketed in the United States as 'Cinema Paradiso: The New Version'}, which restored all of the original future, was released into theatres. As the director's cut was the only version to which I had ready access, this was the one that I watched for the first time. The director's cut is notable in that it greatly expands on Alfred's role in Toto's life and career.\n\nIn the hustle-and-bustle of modern Rome, acclaimed film director Salvatore \"Toto\" Di Vita (Jacques Perrin) returns home to a sad message from his elderly mother: \"Alfredo has died.\" During the night, the man reflects on his childhood, when, as a bright and fervent young boy (played by Salvatore Cascio), he used to frequent his small town's local cinema, where the friendly projectionist, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) taught him, however reluctantly, the tricks of the trade. Flash forward several years, and Toto is now a mature and intelligent teenager, falling for the first (and only) time into the throes of young love. Though I have not seen the shortened theatrical version, from what I've been able to gather, the story doesn't delve too deeply into the adventures of the adult Toto. In the director's cut, most of the additional running time is dedicated to his home-town return, as he is drawn almost overwhelmingly into the regretful ghosts of his past. These sequences are, of course, not without interest, but Tornatore is at his strongest in the first act, with Toto as an impressionable young boy immersed in the joy of cinema.\n\nPhilippe Noiret is wonderful as the warm and occasionally brusque film projectionist, and his interactions with Toto (especially young Salvatore Cascio) develop into a powerful father-son relationship. The director's cut intriguingly suggests that Alfred deliberately mislead Toto about Elena (Agnese Nano, later Brigitte Fossey) in order to preserve his chances of succeeding with his #1 love of all, movies. Alfred suspected that, had Toto married Elena, he would never have been able to become an accomplished film director \u0096 as a beloved father figure for the boy, he made the difficult decision that Toto could never have made. The ethical complications of Alfred's decision are problematic, but one can at least follow his logic, and his motives, however misguided, were certainly well-intended. At the film's end, as the adult Toto is doubting his love for cinema, his passion is reassured with a wonderful montage of the romantic moments that the town's prudish priest had once sliced from every film to be screened in his theatre. This is the magic of cinema. It's not just the films themselves, but also the flood of personal memories that accompanies each forbidden screen embrace."

The last scene is simply scintillating. Toto, now an adult, is handed a box with film cut outs of kissing scenes that were banned when he was a kid. And Alfredo wanted him to have them after his death. When he plays the video, alone in a cinema, and Enio Morricone's music starts, you feel elevated and invaded by all sorts of emotions. I was at the cinema for the 25th anniversary of this film, and everybody was crying by the time this scene started. Me included.\n\nIt's just a magical piece of film making that everyone should watch at least once. After Cinema Paradiso, you may find it hard to enjoy the majority of movies you watch. It's just that good!"

I watched it several times after and have always enjoyed the humor and the wonderfully scripted characters. Unfortunately, I recently had to view the Director's cut. If you have never seen this beautiful film, avoid the Director's cut at all costs. If you have seen this movie and loved it, do not ruin the experience by watching the bloated Director's cut version with, not only unnecessary story elements, but whole new story lines that ruin the appeal of the original and make the main character less sympathetic."

Then, sometimes, I see a movie that shakes me to my foundations. Usually, I watch a movie and if I enjoy it I'll say so and maybe mention it to some friends. However, when I see a movie like Cinema Paradiso, the next day I find myself sitting in my room, obsessively thinking about and Googling it. This movie (and of course its soundtrack) have haunted me from the day I first saw it (maybe eight months ago). I won't give anything away, but watch this movie! That said, I would like to make one thing clear: DO NOT RENT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT! The director's cut of this film takes a perfect piece of cinema and turns it into a pointless soap opera style piece of garbage. Rent the original cut, it's my second favourite film of all time (behind Amadeus) and you won't regret it. Now why are you still reading this? Go rent the movie!!"

Also not sure what version I saw on TCM in 2021 but it seemed much the same.\n\nThe friendship between Alfredo, a film projectionist doing a job he loves, and Toto, a child with a burning desire to learn his trade, must rank as one of the most heart-warming Italian films. This is quite different than the 1940's and 50's post-war realist movies that Italy is famous for as it warms rather than breaks your heart. It also shows the raw emotions that are released when a man revisits his childhood.\n\nAs the movie fast forwards to adulthood, we see Toto the man is living the good life. He is a movie director who has made the grade. When his mother calls to tell him of Alfredo's death, there is some question as to whether he will return for the funeral. His life has changed. No longer does he live in a Southern Italian village but in Rome, the nation's ancient and cosmopolitan capital. He has wealth, women and good looks. Going back home represents another time and place and not something he relishes. When he does return, he is admonished by his mother who feels he is not happy and needs to settle down with the right woman. She is very grateful for his generosity which has helped her materially but now her one wish is for him to be happy.\n\nThe adult Toto takes part in the funeral, walking with the aged villagers who remember him as a child. He greets, giving handshakes and kisses but sadly, the village no longer resonates with life and the old theatre of his childhood is soon to be torn down. While in the projection booth of the theatre, he finds a surprisingly joyful reel of film that highlights moments in cinematic history put together by his old friend. What his life holds afterwards we don't know but the experience of going back home has clearly registered with him. I'm sure it also registers with viewers of this wonderful movie."

If yes you are at the right spot reading this, If not then maybe this isn't the movie for you..\n\nI am indeed very much so, and therefore..\n\nThis is simply my favourite movie.\n\nBy the way there were two versions of the film originally a longer much worse one and a slightly shorter version which is the final one and the one which is now widely available and the one finally kept by the director.\n\nThe longer version was a bit of a pity I'm afraid, It made the movie loose all its magic and the director Mr Tornatore, was incredibly keen, smart to cut those non-sense scenes and keep only the ones that where useful to preserve all the magic of the movie intact. and here we are talking about a great amount of magic indeed!\n\nThis film is quite biographical and talks about important things in life (I lived most of them too)\n\nThings that happen in real life , the first love, true friendship between two differently aged persons, and great life learnings and true life situations such as an first special magical love you once unsuccessfully tried to pursue in your life but like in Dante's literature (inferno) that so many times slips away , and when you try to recover it it may well be too late, it talks about career decisions and life ambition and it is also one the most beautiful most romantic movie I 've ever seen.\n\nIs also an\" Homage \" to the history of movie making and of the world of cinema in general throughout the years, many people won't remember it but the firm was made and produced in the the difficult late 1980's( 1988-89) when cinema was actually truly dying , cinemas were empty ( I actually first saw the movie in Italian in almost empty cinema in 1990) , when the movie came about the true and sad reality was that people didn't't go to the movies anymore and rather just hired a movie tape at home or not even that..\n\nSo this masterpiece was like a Hymn like the french revolution's \"la marseilles hymn\" coming to the rescue of all the things that cinema represents to us as humans, the movie therefore appeared just in the right moment and for me it came to engrave in our hearts our love for cinema and tried at that to rescue all the movie movie making and of the magic world of cinema making, that was becoming extinct..\n\nTo me it came like a first love, a surprise and reminded us all what going to the cinema is all about the experience, the magic feeling you get , the sensations and feelings you share with a crowd of unknown people laughing all together.\n\nThe film is a poetical representation of love , is about sharing feelings, sharing those special limited, instants of limited time in your life on this planet, and feel with other humans the warmth in your heart , the magic that cannot ever be replaced of the first time your heart actually gets loose and suddenly accelerates and your feelings explode and intensify and you feel love for the first time in your life..\n\nThis film is about love the love of people, the love of humankind, it is a film about the first love, the one you will never forget and about the great love and passion some people like me feel about cinema in general.\n\nUndoubtedly a Magnificent masterpiece and a fantastic timeless LOVE-film made for our souls by Giusseppe Tornatore, wonderful music and Love Theme written by Ennio Morricone and violin played by Itzhak Perlman my most admired violinist creates like in Queen's famous song A KIND OF MAGIC .. few other films have ever matched..\n\nThis film is a a must see a classic unrepeatable, once in a lifetime cinematographic jewel masterpiece, the kind I love to watch with my wife in a romantic winter evening by the chimney place.. Enjoy!\n\nErnesto Tejedor from Barcelona Spain, Living now in Switzerland"

I immediately realized that I ain't just a film buff, I am a Filmmaker. Coming to the review part of this movie, the story telling style of Giussepe is so unique and nostalgic that while you see the people sitting inside Theater reacting to on-screen emotions is classic and makes us feel we are part of them inside Nuovo Paradiso Theater. Alfredo is a great teacher and projectionist who lived Films all his life. Toto at the same time has just discovered his love for cinema. The beauty of cinema Paradiso is on one hand there's Alfredo who dreams to become a filmmaker however he couldn't because he's the only projectionist in Town and on the other hand there's Toto who's desperate about Films and wants to become friends with Alfredo to watch & learn films. However A school exam decides whether they gonna be friends or not. Adult 'Toto' recollects his memory and childhood experience in the village. The Gift Alfredo had kept all this while for Toto is Alfredo's experience as a single audience. Cinema Paradiso is a beautiful experience that you will remember all your life. Thank you Cinema Paradiso for making me realize my passion for Films."

The full-length version makes a central character morally ambiguous, in contrast to the uniformly benevolent father figure depicted in the shorter version. In the long version this character commits an act similar to but far crueler than the behavior of another character who is ridiculed early on. Most new viewers will watch the full-length film. The shorter version is more satisfying for those who secretly prefer fairy tales in which the good guys & bad guys are consistently good guys & bad guys. Great film!\n\n10/10."

The little boy and Philippe Noiret did a great job here but every actor made a solid casting. Sometimes I had some nostalgic thoughts about my own country. The rating on IMDb with actually 8.3 is okay and not overrated. There was no doubt that it won the Oscar for the best foreign movie and also for many other international awards. My vote with my wife is 7/10. Go and see it."

For no apparent reason, it completely abandons all of the buildup that was made in the first half and turns extremely bland.\n\nUsually movies with no purpose and direction receive a lower rating from me, but the only reason I have rated this so highly at a 3 is solely because the setup was good.

This beautifully crafted film captures the essence of nostalgia, love, and the bittersweet nature of growing up. The story of young Salvatore and his passionate relationship with the local cinema is a profound reminder of the impact films have on our lives and memories.\n\nThe direction by Giuseppe Tornatore is nothing short of brilliant, weaving together rich visuals and an emotionally resonant score by Ennio Morricone that lingers in your heart long after the credits roll. The performances are extraordinary, especially by Philippe Noiret as Alfredo, whose wisdom and warmth offer guidance to the impressionable Salvatore. Their bond embodies the mentor-mentee relationship, highlighting the power of friendship and the influence of art.\n\nWhat truly sets Cinema Paradiso apart is its ability to evoke a deep emotional response. I found myself laughing, crying, and reminiscing about my own childhood experiences in the darkened theater. The film beautifully illustrates the transient nature of time and the fleeting moments we cherish, reminding us to hold on to our dreams and the people we love.\n\nEvery frame of this film is a love letter to cinema, celebrating its ability to transport us to different worlds. It's not just a story about a boy and his love for movies; it's about the universal experience of growing up, loss, and the enduring power of memories. Cinema Paradiso is a film that speaks to the heart and soul of anyone who has ever experienced the magic of the movies.\n\nThis film deserves every bit of its acclaim, and I wholeheartedly give it a perfect 10 out of 10. It's a cinematic experience that will stay with you forever, a true treasure of world cinema."

One, the acting was exceptional good, in the way the very young \"Toto\" was very convincing in acting his age in post war Italy and then the teen-age \"Toto\" was excellent in showing a boy becoming a man in war time Italy and showing a beginning interest in the wonder and love of films, by experiencing the films shown in the town's only movie theater and even making them himself and then the adult \"Toto\" was also excellent in the end of movie when it was apparent that he has to have films to survive his everyday world of making them too. The second one is the direction and I am including the third one, the writing one here too. The director was very correct in showing us the life of this town surrounding the nightly showings of the movies in the Cinema Paradiso theater. I am very involve in this movie each time I see it, I start daydreaming that I am actuals a member of that community and seeing the movies at Cinema Paradiso movie theater in that same Italian town, in which \"Toto\" grew up in."

At once a gorgeous ode to film itself, it is also an ode to love and the friends we make along the long road of life. Although some decisions may seem dubious, they were made with love and hope in mind. Along with showing an incredible and heartfelt story, the film also flaunts unforgettable cinematography. The film is truly a work of art. A wonderful, heartwarming, awe-inspiring work of art. This is a film that makes you feel, laugh, cry, and love. Alfredo is more than just a friend to Salvatore, and although it didn't always seem it, he had loved Salvatore and had seen something great within him. Alfredo's final gift to Salvatore is one of the crowning achievements of cinema. It is arguably the most beautiful scene ever."

That said...\n\nThere's an interesting *idea* for a movie here, but ultimately it's just not about anything. The whole film is a flashback from a character we hardly know -- had we a better idea of who this guy was as an adult, then his formative childhood/adolescent experiences might mean something, but since he's a cipher, why should we care about how he got there?\n\nEven the much-lauded montage at the end (that's all I'll say about it) is kind of clumsy, and too-little too-late. There's nothing more painful than *not* crying in the last reel of a tear-jerker, and that's how I felt at this film. (And if someone like me fails to respond to a sentimental film about a person whose life was molded by the movies, trust me, something is very wrong.)\n\nI'd like to see Tornatore's original edit, though -- I may just be responding negatively to the chopped-by-Miramax version. (Check out the director's very anti-nostalgic \"Everything's Fine,\" which acts as an enema to the saccharine of \"Cinema Paradiso.\")"

Director Tornatore brings a passion to the film which seeps out of every frame and invites the viewer to revisit their youth, their hopes, their dreams and the crushing truth of reality. You will not see a more beautiful, haunting film than this. Phillipe Noiret gives the performance of his life (one which he played a subtle riff on in \" Il Postino\") and Ennio Morricone's score ranks right up there as his best. For true junkies like myself I would highly recommend getting a hold of the director's cut in which an additional 50 minutes of material is added. While as a whole it is not as good a movie (Tornatore clearly needed a forceful editor) it does provide insight into what happeneed to Toto's beloved Elena and surprises viewers with a heart-wrenching plot twist which was cut from the original."

Interesting enough it is rated R and after seeing the film twice I can't see why. There is nothing in the film which promotes all the objections such as overt nudity, sex or violence. And yet, the village priest see's to it that not even Kissing is allowed to be viewed by the audience. Never the less, it wins many awards and is worth keeping as a movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ah, \"Cinema Paradiso\"! A true masterpiece of Italian cinema as well world cinema. Set in a small Sicilian village, the film is a nostalgic coming-of-age story that explores the power of cinema and the enduring bonds of friendship.\n\nThe main character is Salvatore \"Toto\" Di Vita, played by Salvatore Cascio as a boy and Marco Leonardi as a young man. Toto is a young boy who develops a deep love for the movies after being taken under the wing of the local projectionist, Alfredo, portrayed by Philippe Noiret. Alfredo becomes a mentor and father figure to Toto, teaching him about life, love, and the magic of the silver screen.\n\nThe film beautifully captures the themes of love, loss, and the passage of time. It showcases the transformative power of cinema and how it can shape and influence our lives. It explores the complex emotions of nostalgia and the bittersweet longing for the past.\n\nThe review of \"Cinema Paradiso\" would be incomplete without mentioning its deeply emotional tone. The film has a certain melancholic beauty that resonates with viewers. It leaves a profound impact by depicting the innocence of childhood and the sacrifices we make for our dreams. The ending, in particular, is a poignant gut-punch that leaves many viewers in tears.\n\nOne scene that always brings tears to my eyes is when Toto watches a reel of censored kisses that Alfredo had cut from the films over the years. As Toto sees the powerful emotions displayed on screen, he realizes the depth of Alfredo's love for him and the sacrifices he made for his happiness. It evokes a mix of sadness, gratitude, and a longing for lost moments.\n\nThe most iconic quote from the film is Alfredo's wise words to Toto: \"Living here day by day, you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people. The land where you were born. But now, no. It's not possible. Right now, you're blinder than I am.\"\n\nOne of the important lessons viewers may miss is the idea that life is fleeting and we must cherish the moments we have. The film encourages us to appreciate the simple pleasures and relationships in our lives, as they may not last forever.\n\n\"Cinema Paradiso\" touches on the philosophical concepts of nostalgia, the passage of time, and the role of art in our lives. It invites us to reflect on the impact of film and how it can shape our perceptions and memories.\n\nIf you enjoyed \"Cinema Paradiso,\" you may also appreciate other Italian films such as \"La Dolce Vita\" and \"The Great Beauty.\" Additionally, books like \"The Dreamers\" by Gilbert Adair and \"The Film Book\" by Ronald Bergan delve into the power of cinema and its effects on our lives.\n\nOverall, \"Cinema Paradiso\" is a deeply moving and visually stunning film that will leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it. Its exploration of love, loss, and the magic of cinema is a testament to its enduring appeal."

        "review_detailed_main": "You should approach any movie with the term 'director's cut' with caution. It can mean that we are now seeing the film the way the director intended it to been seen before the studio hacks got their hands on it or it could simply mean a lot more of the same, the unchecked ego of its creator. When \"Cinema Paradiso\" was first shown here it ran a very serviceable two hours and told the story of a boy, Toto, in Sicily whose love of cinema is instilled in him through his relationship with the elderly projectionist in the local movie house. The movie was told in flashback as the boy returns, a grown man and now a famous director himself, to his home town for the funeral of his friend and mentor. A sub-plot involving the girl he loved and lost to someone else was completely jettisoned.\n\nNow the film has been re-issued with this sub-plot restored to its rightful place and rather than detracting from the film's main theme it adds to it and deepens it. Now we can see that the boy's life was not only influenced by Alfredo, the projectionist, by making him aware of the joys of cinema but more directly, in a much more personal fashion. In a way it's like seeing a different movie but a much more rounded and mature one.\n\nBoth versions are, of course, superb but while the shorter version plays heavily on the sentimentality quotient the longer version is a darker and sadder affair and allows Jacques Perrin to fully develop the character of the grown Toto, (in the shorter version we can only guess at his motivations). In this version Perrin's performance is just one in a trio of brilliant performances. As the child Toto, Salvatore Cascio holds the cuteness factor at just the right level while the great Philippe Noiret is perfectly marvellous as Alfredo. The shorter version will, of course, appeal to anyone who loves cinema, even remotely, (and Alfredo's 'gift' to Toto is director Giuseppe Tornatore's gift to us), but the longer version is a masterpiece that engages us on a much more profound level. However, neither of them should be missed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Cinema Paradiso works very well because Giuseppe Tornatore, for all his schmaltzy moments with his characters, loves cinema incredibly and especially the communal and personal act of going out to see a movie. It also works because for all the sentiment, he makes it a story essentially about a boy, Toto, without a father after the war who finds a surrogate-cum-mentor with Alfredo, the projectionist at the theater. Their bond makes for the emotional core of the film, as the grown-up Toto comes back to the town he left so long ago for Alfredo's funeral, and looks back on his childhood and adolescence in this small down of Giacardola.\n\nThe clips of the films are one of the strong-points, and just the scenes inside of the Paradiso, where there's lots of warm human comedy coming out of the fun poked at the 'old-days' of repression (i.e. ringing the bell for a kissing scene), or just the reactions to the different genres and styles (everything from Visconti to Chaplin to Bardot is screened). And there's a whole host of characters Tornatore has that makes a lot of the first half of the picture pretty special.\n\nIt's maybe in the second half that it got a little too 'adorable' for its own good, or just too much of a similar one-track kind of narrative with the teen Toto falling in love with a girl whom makes it his first real roller-coaster of a relationship. But, as mentioned, Tornatore keeps it simple, particularly with respect to Toto and Alfredo (the latter actor, Phillipe Noiret, is incredible in the part, even when blind for half the running time). It's also a given that maestro Ennio Morricone delivers up the goods and makes this really rousing, the sentiment not false for a lot of the time as one of his best scores.\n\nIf I didn't find it overall a masterpiece for some of its sappy bits and occasional over-the-top performance that doesn't click (most of them do, it's Italy after all), it's an exceptional effort for what it tries to accomplish and what many films end up being simply sappy can't quite reach. The film earns its keep by making it very relatable, and reminds us why some of us love movies and movie-going very much. It's the 'shmoopy' of Italian cinema lovers everywhere, and its worth the view even in the truncated Harvey Weinstein cut that played at the Rialto theater near my town; a fond goodbye at a fondly remembered theater. 8.5/10"

        "review_title": "A pretty good film",
        "review_detailed_main": "My reaction to this film when I watched it a few years ago was that its first hour was great, but the second hour made a couple poor choices which reduced it to a good film. I had a feeling my opinion would grow this time around, but unfortunately, it remained the same and, if anything, this rewatch solidified my opinion of it even more.\n\nIn spite of my issues with this film though, I don't consider it to be a bad film by any means, The aforementioned first hour, in fact, is about as entertaining and moving as any film has the right to be. Tornatore crafts such a humorous and vividly detailed film which is packed with a few different types of greatness. For example, some of the humor involving Alfredo and Toto resonated with me quite well, like the touches of humor thrown into some of their tense encounters in the first act or Toto helping Alfredo cheat on a test. These bits made their building friendship a blast to watch. I also enjoyed the emphasis given to multiple side characters who either attended the theater or were frequently seen outside it. There's a priest who orders Alfredo to cut all the inappropriate scenes from the films (kissing scenes, typically), a tramp who believes he owns the town square outside the theater, a man who spits on people from the upper balcony of the theater, a man who frequently gets pranked for falling asleep during the movies, and the general rowdiness of the crowd that attends the theater. It's clear that the theater is the centerpiece of the town and the main (well, the only) pastime for many of the town's citizens. Finally, I liked how the film saved most of its sentimentality for the ending. Complimented with Morricone's terrific score, it's almost impossible not to be moved during the final montage.\n\nWhile the film's first hour is strong, the second hour makes some odd narrative choices which fail to capitalize on that potential. Since Alfredo's and Toto's friendship is established for most of the first hour, I found it strange how the second half shifted so much focus away from Alfredo. Instead, we get a romance sub-plot between Toto and Elena. Though I've yet to watch the extended cuts of this film, I've read a decent bit about them and my understanding is that they provide a better thematic significance for that sub-plot, so I may enjoy this film more if I watch those versions. Who knows. With the international cut though, that sub-plot took time away from what I liked the most about the film. To top it off, I also found certain elements of that sub-plot creepy, like Toto waiting outside Elena's house for (I think) 100 days in an attempt to get her to like him. After the focus finally gets back to Alfredo, he only stays onscreen for about five more more minutes and, while I found their conversations during those five minutes powerful, they ultimately left me asking for more. Granted, the final act is kind of effective and the aforementioned ending is terrific, but the middle act was a huge misstep and left me very cold. And it's a real shame, because the film had a lot going for it with the first hour. The second hour failed to follow up on that potential though.\n\nIn spite of my issues though, I'd still recommend the film. The strengths of the first hour and the ending were more than enough to save the day, so I did enjoy the film. Just like my first viewing though, I wasn't so crazy on the second hour. I'll likely check out the longer cuts in the future though to see if this film finally clicks with me."

The story takes place in a small town in post WWII Italy. With television not yet invented the town's only mean of entertainment is the movies. Every night the Cinema Paradiso movie theater is packed full of towns people who come to laugh, cry, and cheer. The story is told through the eyes of a boy called Salvatore. At an early age he falls in love with the movies and the theaters projectionist, Alfredo. Above all it is about the everlasting magic of the movies and the different affects it has on different people. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a big fan of movies, modern or classic."

        "review_title": "Truly Affecting, Romanticized View of Cinema in a Sicilian Village",
        "review_detailed_main": "Before watching this on DVD just now, I had not seen director/screenwriter Giuseppe Tornatore's internationally renowned hit movie - at least the 123-minute version - since its initial 1990 release in the U.S., but I remember having mixed feelings that ran the gamut between being moved by its genuine poignancy and being resentful about what I felt at the time was its shameless heartstring tugging. Nearly two decades later, as I have gotten older and closer to the adult Salvatore's age, I have softened considerably in my opinion of the film, an open-hearted tribute to cinema and its transcendent impact on people's lives. Granted it is awash in sentimentality, but with its unique combination of storytelling elements inspired in equal parts by Chaplin and Fellini, there is a burnished, nostalgic glow to the whole venture as most of it is designed as a flashback.\n\nThe plot begins with Salvatore ensconced in middle age as a successful film director based in Rome. Unexpectedly, he makes plans to return to his hometown in Sicily for the first time in almost thirty years. The reason is two-fold: the funeral of Alfredo, the projectionist who first introduced Salvatore to films, and the demolition of the Cinema Paradiso theater where they showed films to the enthusiastic denizens every Saturday night. This triggers memories of Salvatore's childhood at the old theater with Alfredo and then his adolescence and young adulthood when he falls in love with a beautiful local girl named Elena. In true Romeo and Juliet fashion, he is separated from his one true love by her disapproving father, a wealthy banker, and I have to admit this is the part of the film I still find a bit predictable with Tornatore's Baroque sense of romanticism in high gear. The scenes that really have enduring impact are those between the young, energetic Salvatore, nicknamed \"Toto\", and the surly but lovable Alfredo. Tornatore captures the magical bond between the two, including a tragic episode that forces them to reverse their roles in the projection room.\n\nInterestingly, the 174-minute version presented on the second disc of the 2006 two-DVD set fills in the blanks about Elena's fate. The older Salvatore is reunited with Elena and finds out the truth behind their separation. While I enjoyed and appreciated the longer director's cut, I feel overall the additional scenes don't add as much dimension to the story as the nearly three-hour running time warrants. I think my preference for the heartwarming Alfredo-Toto scenes gravitate me more toward the 123-minute version presented on the first disc. The central performances are memorable with the obvious standouts being Phillipe Noiret (Il Postino) as Alfredo and cherubic Salvatore Cascio as Toto. Looking like a Neapolitan Josh Hartnett, Marco Leonardi (Like Water for Chocolate) takes over as Toto and brings youthful, hormonally-driven fervor to the role, and Agnese Nano brings the requisite dreamy quality to Elena.\n\nAs the older Salvatore, Jacques Perrin (Z, The Young Girls of Rochefort) bears so little resemblance to his younger counterparts that his performance feels somewhat removed. In the longer version, his performance resonates more, especially as he shares the screen with Brigitte Fossey (Forbidden Games) as the older Elena. The famous screening room ending is in both versions - the showing of Alfredo's gift to Salvatore, a reel of film clips highlighting kissing scenes excised by the local priest - though I find just as touching the theater demolition scene with the now-aged villagers looking on in a most resigned manner. Blasco Giurato's cinematography is stunning throughout, and enough cannot be said of Ennio Morricone's memorable music score, one of cinema's most beautiful in evoking the movies aura of romantic nostalgia.\n\nBeyond the director's cut of the movie, the 2006 Limited Collector's Edition DVD has several extras of note, the best being an informative, somewhat academic commentary track from Italian film historian Millicent Marcus interspersed with periodic personal recollections from Tornatore, as well as a fifteen-minute retrospective featurette, \"Exploring a Timeless Classic\". Of more anecdotal interest are a four-minute short on how Baltimore's Little Italy neighborhood has embraced the film with an annual outdoor showing encouraging more than a few romances; two theatrical trailers - the original and the director's cut released in 2002; and most inconsequentially, a Food Network show with Napa chef Michael Chiarello with recipes inspired by the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Cinema Paradiso', in both its versions, is a wonderful movie all about movies, the love of the movies, movie images, and movie influences. It is also about growing up, friendship, young love, regret, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nWe follow Salvatore (Toto) from being a young child, eyes wide with wonder at the world projected on the big screen, through his hesitant adolescence, to adulthood as a successful film-maker in his own right. Playing Toto at the three stages of his life are two outstanding actors: Salvatore Cascio as the child, and Jacques Perrin as the adult still searching for the missing piece of his life's puzzle. The teenage Toto is portrayed less well, by Marco Leonardi, perhaps because of his lack of screen time - although there is one sequence in particular concerning his character and that of Elisa which stands out.\n\nAlso in the cast is the excellent Philippe Noiret as Alfredo, the cinema projectionist who becomes the sage, the wise voice of reason within Toto's life.\n\nFor me, though, the best sequences are the ones which take place within the Cinema Paradiso - the snatches of famous films which play before us, the reactions of the audience, the whole ambience of a little flea pit. And the famous final montage with the screen kisses is superb.\n\nThe extended version of 'Cinema Paradiso' puts back around an hour, mainly concerning Toto and Elisa on his return to the village after many years. This is interesting, but the short version packs a considerable punch too."

It's a long film but you don't notice the time passing as you watch, since it speaks on many different levels of terms of life, memory and experience.\n\nThe film has several storylines, reflecting different comments. A film about a first love, about a mentor and a student, about films or about not being able to go home again. However, to select a single one of these as the main story would miss the overall experience, since they are parts of an overall tapestry about the tough choices life presents.\n\nThe standard hollywood treatment would made a completely happy ending, our hero gets together with the girl (now woman) of his heart; continues his successful movie career; his mentor remains flawless, and somehow restores the old town's spiritual heart. This doesn't happen, for as his mentor states \"life is much harder than in the movies\".\n\nNot to say that this a sad film, it's an extremely happy one, and by being tough and presenting a more truthful aspect of experience, its exquisite moments are that much more joyous."

        "review_detailed_main": "Cinema Paradiso, is an Italian film but I was able to see a dubbed copy of it in English whereas it is originally in Italian. The film is set in Italy in the early years of cinema. It is about a young boy named Salvatore (who is nicknamed Toto) who daily goes to the theaters to watch movies. He becomes friends with the projectionist named Alfredo. The two of them bond and Alfredo teaches Salvatore about film and how to use the projector and the film shows their friendship and Salvatore's life and how he grows up and the impact film and Alfredo has had on him. Winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film at The Academy Awards; The BAFTA Award for Best Actor (Philippe Noiret, who plays Alfredo), Best Actor In A Supporting Role (Salvatore Cascio, who plays Salvatore as a child), Best Film Not In The English Language, Best Original Film Score and Best Original Screenplay at The BAFTA Awards; The Grand Prize Of The Jury for the film's director Giuseppe Tornatore at the Cannes Film Festival; The Best Film Award at The Cleveland International Film Festival; The Cesar Award for Best Poster at The Cesar Awards; The David Award for Best Music at The David di Donatello Awards; The European Film Award for Best Actor (Philippe Noiret) and The Special Prize Of The Jury for Giuseppe Tornatore at The European Film Awards; The Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at The Golden Globe Awards; The ALFS Award for Actor Of The Year and Best Foreign Language Film Of The Year at The London Critics Circle Film Awards; The Mainichi Film Concours Award for Best Foreign Language Film at The Mainichi Film Concours; The Robert Award for Best Foreign Film at The Robert Festival and The Special Award for Best Young Actor Under Nine Appearing In A Foreign Film (Salvatore Cascio) at The Young Artist Awards. Before I start my review let me say that the version I saw of the film was the original version running at 121 minutes. A year or two ago a new version was released with extra footage that runs about 174 minutes. One of the reasons I saw Cinema Paradiso was because I always read good things about it and it is often talked and praised about on different movie sites and message boards. Another reason that I saw this film was when I was in a small independent video store once that carried a lot of foreign, independent and offbeat films. I saw this film on the shelf and on the corner there was a note from one of the workers of the store that said something like \"This is the reason I opened this store\". After reading many good reviews and after reading this note I decided to see the film. Cinema Paradiso has good direction, a good script, good performances from the two main actors and a good supporting cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good production design. The film is a good looking film and it is sweet and touching. The film has a nice story and nice characters that you begin to care about and you want to see how the film progresses and what happens to them. This is a film that I think people young and old will enjoy because it is a coming of age story and it will appeal to many. The film is well made and is just generally a well done feel good movie that hits all the right notes."

Viva La Tornatore! Grande! Later Tornatore directed MALENA, it is also a great movie, but it never reaches the greatness achieved by CINEMA PARADISO. The movie shows the diverse nature of the crowd present at a movie theater, people in all kinds of moods, as Roger Ebert said,\"Romances are launched in the darkness of the theater, friendships are sealed, wine is drunk, cigarettes smoked, babies nursed, feet stomped, victories cheered, sissies whistled at...\"! The movie sometimes reminds us of Fellini, especially when in the long shots someone suddenly appears in close up. Like Truffuat, Tornatore gives a special place to posters in this movie. 'This film captures the essence of a man's life, gently bringing us from childhood to middle age believably and beautifully.' There is a presence of warmth and humor in the movie, from the fainting lottery winner to the zealous censorious priest, and the madman who goes on saying, \"This square is mine\"! It is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes poignant but it's always warm, wonderful, and satisfying. It is one of a kind. Salvatore is present in all of us. And when Alfredo says, \"Living here day by day, you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people. The land where you were born. But now, no. It's not possible. Right now you're blinder than I am.\" --- it applies to all of us on a universal level. And the music? It is brilliant, romantic and never fails to touch the heart, kudos to Ennio Morricone. The movie is perfect, beautiful and to describe in one word: BELLISSIMA!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Bellissimo! One of life's greatest delectations is the medium of film, more specifically the cinema establishments. A cinema was, well still is, able to bring together a community of movie enthusiasts and enable the minds in the room to escape the boundaries of reality. Films can influence. Films can inspire. Yet most profoundly, films can entertain. Tornatore's post-WWII Italian drama is an ode to the boundless possibilities of said medium, and as a reclusive cinephile who yearns to be ascended by these moving pictures, I gobbled this feature up quicker than munching on fresh carbonara. After receiving news of the death of his fatherly figure Alfredo, Salvatore reminisces about his childhood and how he discovered his infatuation with film.\n\nAs predicted, considering this title won numerous awards between '89-'91, it's stuffed with tropes and sub-plots found in a variety of genres. Most worked in Tornatore's favour, the remaining few on the other hand proved to be a futile exercise in overloaded storytelling. Immediately what springs to mind, and has yet to abscond the empty void that is my brain, is Morricones' composition. Sensationally authentic, with subtle Italian flavours that truly encapsulated Sicilian aesthetics. The ambience, the atmosphere and the almighty sense of communal drive. It's what makes Cinema Paradiso so incredibly enticing. Fully complementing the heartfelt narrative style that Tornatore had lovingly produced.\n\nThe plot is unwrapped through Salvatore's perspective, naturally a consequence of this is that his life story is the prominent development function for all characters. Aside from Alfredo, his war widow mother Maria and his childhood love interest Elena, other characters were mere background villagers that were implemented to enhance the overall lighthearted humour. It was a success. Purely shining the spotlight of Salvatore, and experiencing how films had moulded his life, was effective. The glisten in young Salvatore's eyes reminded me of when I received that very same sparkle. Watching my first film, overwhelmed by inspiration.\n\nWhilst Tornatore's intention was to celebrate this popular art form, the drama surrounding his characters also took precedent. For the most part, both elements were well balanced. The second act however, which I can only assume the theatrical cut was edited with a chainsaw, unfortunately lost momentum. Pivotal scenes felt abruptly removed, particularly the sweeping romanticism between Salvatore and Elena, and severely came across as underdeveloped. The romance, being a manifestation of everything that Salvatore had witnessed being a projectionist and having to splice out kissing scenes (more on that in a moment), had no time to truly simmer. Undercooked spaghetti of love, or something of that cuisine. Then randomly shoving in the compulsory military service montage, and the second act truly proved to be voided of purpose. I can only assume that the director's cut, with an additional fifty minutes of footage, resolves these issues.\n\nFortunately, the concluding act kicks in and rounds off a sterling performance from Noiret who acts as the father figure for Salvatore. A much required dynamic that allowed some emotional connection between Alfredo and Salvatore. Only to the conclude on a whimsically melancholic note that is sure to make you empathise with Alfredo. Yes, the \"kissing scene montage\" as it's infamously referred as. Profusely removing comedy and pushing sentimentality forward. It's not particularly subtle, but Tornatore solidifies his sentiments of intertwining pragmatism with nostalgia. Closing this coming-of-age narrative with a celebratory tear.\n\nCinema Paradiso is a reflection. A reminder if you will. That the age of cinema is far from dilapidated. A celebration of an art form that we, the general public, take for granted. And most importantly, it proves that film can inspire generations, shaping their lives for the better. My criticisms I suspect are mostly regarding the international cut of the film, but still need to be addressed. I'll be sure to give the director's cut a gander in the near future, in the hope that it only betters the story. For now, whilst it isn't the greatest export from Italy, it certainly is deserved of its unanimous praise. Even if the lighthearted nature downplays the dramatic elements."

It was a revelation. The storyline, the story telling, the cinematography, the acting and the score just works so well together! Its the only movie..yet which i had no choice but give it a perfect 10! The plot outline or the movie trailer doesn't do justice to this masterpiece. Some people describe it as an art-house movie but it isn't, its just a GOOD Movie. This movie is a reason as to why we like movies in the first place. Watch out for the emotions in the lead adult character at the end of the movie. Its an emotion the viewer will also feel. Just watch the movie without pre-judgment and i am sure it will have an impact on you! Super!"

        "review_detailed_main": "When a young boy loses his father to WWII, a lonely Sicilian projectionist grudgingly accepts the film-obsessed kid as his assistant. Childless, the older man relates to his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9e like a son before a nitrate explosion leaves him blind and thrusts the boy into a full-time position behind the curtain. The resulting fire also destroys the town's little theater, but a local lottery winner recognizes its importance to the community and rebuilds, taking the opportunity to cut out the censor-happy cleric who's been trimming romantic content for religious reasons.\n\nThis entire story is wrapped in a golden air of fond remembrance, which should come as little surprise since it's basically the love-letter autobiography of writer/director Giuseppe Tornatore. He even filmed Cinema Paradiso in the same village that inspired it. That makes for a very intimate, revealing narrative, but also a highly idealized one. Its plot doesn't lack drama or heartache, but Tornatore chooses not to chase those trickier conflicts. He prefers the scent of rose-tinted nostalgia. The result is a very warm, sentimental experience, but also a rather loose, passive one. It's almost like a confessional, a sort of \"here's why I am the way that I am\" that concedes his limitations as a man while also asserting their importance to his development as an auteur. The closing montage makes for a beautiful, memorable farewell, but it was blatantly telegraphed more than a hundred minutes prior."

But buoy.. was I amazed. The movie is just less than 3 hours(extended version) but there is not a single moment where you find yourself detached from the movie. I wont call the acting at its best but its the story that forms the backbone of the movie. The story brings out relationship between three main pillars of human life - 'Love', 'Friendship' and 'Carrier'. This is the best romantic drama movie I have ever seen. If you weigh story more than big actor names and watching with subtitles is not a turn off(for non Italians) then this is a must watch for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "This ranks as one of my all time favourites. A celebration of the cinema and of life, Cinema Paradiso is beautifully crafted and one of those rare few that manages to touch on so many global themes (while lesser films struggle to find any theme). A coming of age film about (among other things) friendship, family, love, loss, war, religion, and politics, set against the rugged beauty of the Sicilian countryside, Paradiso transports the viewer effortlessly to that place, as if we had lived there all our lives.\n\nLike Hallstrom's \"My Life As A Dog\" and Robert's \"My Fathers Glory\", Tornatore has surrounded his protagonist with quirky characters in perfect balance; i.e. the kinds of people-you-know, and people-you'd-like-to-know. This alone makes it the type of universally transferable movie everyone can enjoy. But for me, the masterstroke was Toto's love of movies. This added another more subtle level to an already well rounded flick. Of course the Paradiso was a metaphor for change/progress, a symbol of community spirit, etc. However, to try and analyze this film too much would be doing it a supreme injustice. It is simply a beautiful piece of cinematic history, a film for all true movie-lovers."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was beginning to lose faith in humanity. Many of the films I had seen in recent times were so badly conceived that I was beginning to lose my passion for film.\n\nI had heard about Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, because it was on people's favourite movie lists, and was a top IMDb film. When I saw it on sale, I bought it, and that's when it all happened. I fell in love with cinema again.\n\nI'm not going to go into the details of the many characters and situations in this film. Suffice it to say, it is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. I have the largest film collection of anyone I know, and this film is without a doubt in my top ten. It is full of love, nostalgia and beauty.\n\nBoth versions of this film are great, but angle the overall piece in different ways. The extended version (director's cut) concentrates a lot on the aftermath of the love story, and is essential viewing for anyone who loves this film. You can easily fall in love with this film watching the shortened version only, however.\n\nOverall, I am back in love with cinema, and this incredible film is the one and only reason for this. The word \"masterpiece\" was created for this movie."

There were no scenes that dragged (for me), and the subtitles did not distract me from the wonderful camera work and cinematography which sometimes happens to me with foreign language films. No repeated viewings are needed to understand and enjoy this film.\n\nRobert Osbourne of Turner Classic Movies spoke of the new version that is available with over 50 minutes of added footage, but said that he thought that this is one film where added footage did not improve on the original, though he left it to the viewers to decide for themselves by watching them as they are both available on DVD. I for one can not see how this film could possibly be improved upon,\n\nbut I will of course have to see for myself!"

I thought the cast was excellent, every performance touched on all the right points, the writing was superb, the main characters were well developed\u0085and I never knew would have thought that scraps of film put to together would make me cry.\n\nThis was a film that I never wanted to end. It is a multi-layered love story and and really just a story about how life unfolds. The way that many things are brought up in the film casually and then used later for emotional impact is quite beautiful. I know some people are \"afraid\" of foreign films, but if you watch only one \u2013 make it this one. I highly recommend this film as an example of how meaningful films are constructed."

There are endless slow-moving scenes of how much he loves movies. It can throw you into a real funk. And the ending doesn't resolve the biggest mystery of the film. I won't spoil it for you but it involves romance.\n\nWho should see this film:\n\n-- Anyone who liked Forrest Gump, a film I personally loathed\n\n-- Arty film types, you have a real racket going in making the rest of us feel inferior for wanting our movies to have plot, pacing, conflict.\n\nI'll give Cinema Paradiso a surprisingly low 5 out of 10. See \"Life is Beautiful\" or \"The Shipping News\" instead."
