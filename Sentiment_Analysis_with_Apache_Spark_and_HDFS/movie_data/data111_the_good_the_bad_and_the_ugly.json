        "review_detailed_main": "A sprawling Western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is a masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing. In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner. Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat' Western.\n\nThe three main characters make the film. Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad') is evil personified. Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing. (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.) Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film. All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly' side of people.\n\nThe movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film. Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on. The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable. Any typical Western clich\u00e9 that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect. Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score.\n\nThis movie is absolutely brilliant. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so. Immediately. (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

        "review_title": "Primal honesty and morality",
        "review_detailed_main": "After many years of barely watching any movies, I treated myself to several classics recently. And this was the best.\n\nThat I so enjoyed this movie so much came as a shock to me. I literally never before have been able to even sit through a western, which (in my admittedly limited experience) was schlock action starring John Wayne as the taciturn all-American good guy being tough and beating up the outlaws. Watching GBU, I was enthralled for the entire three hours. Twice. And if I had time, I would have watched it a third time.\n\nThe setting is typically western: a dry, dusty panorama in which men barely co-exist with each other; few wasted words; and lots of action, horses, and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient institutions of law & order \u0096 all shrouded within a morality play of good vs. bad. But what I liked so much is exactly what I hate about John Wayne westerns \u0096 the seriousness and honesty with which moral context is considered. In Hollywood, good vs. bad is as thoughtlessly superscripted as the protagonists' white and black hats. In GBU every remnant of moralizing has been ruthlessly cut.\n\nGood, Bad, and Ugly are personified in the form of three characters: Bad (\"Sentenza\") is the easiest to understand. He is *very* bad, perhaps not so different from other villains, but much more sharply developed; murderous, sadistic, traitorous, and remorseless. Good (\"Blondie\") and Ugly (\"Tuco\") are more puzzling, but their labels are the key to the movie. Both Blondie and Tuco are outlaws and killers with only the barest hint of morality, but they're not evil in the same way that Sentenza is. Tuco is demonstrative, emotional, loud, wild, and unpredictable; but driven by survival rather than satanic urges. Blondie is cool, calm, rational and controlled \u0096 in many ways similar to Sentenza \u0096 but whereas Sentenza tortures, maims, kills, and lies for the hell of it, even apparently enjoys it, Blondie simply goes about his business coolly, and shows several poignant hints of empathy, decency, and a sense of justice.\n\nGBU takes place during the Civil War and strips away the high-level political struggle of history books, leaving us with the soldier's vantage point of brutality, pointless death, and some individual decency. The politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. GBU hits this point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp because the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn out to be dust-covered blue. Later, they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge, suffering countless pointless deaths and casualties. Because Leone has so rigorously excised traditional off-the-shelf morality, the few instances of humanity are remarkably poignant. One such instance is when Blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier; another is when prisoners are forced \u0096 by Sentenza's orders \u0096 to play music to cover up the screams of the tortured. Sentenza apparently enjoyed the irony of beautiful sounds used for such ends; the musicians are, of course, pained by it.\n\nThat was one of many extraordinarily striking scenes. The honesty of the moral context was what I liked best about the film, but I liked everything else too. Indeed the same primal, ruthless honesty that characterizes the character development pervades the film. The music is unlike anything I'd ever heard \u0096 it's an audible version of the arid west and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film. Underlying the entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting off with what sounds like a screaming hyena. The story took place in New Mexico, and even though it was filmed in Spain, it really does look like New Mexico; and just as in life in the American west, the wide, breathtaking panorama tends to subordinates dialog. Indeed, it is several minutes into the film before even one word is spoken.\n\nThe plot was extremely clever \u0096 and never predictable. High level suspense is maintained for the full three hours. It was hard to imagine how it could unfold \u0096 three uncompromising outlaws in search of one buried treasure; cooperation was not in their nature, but nothing was ever done out of character. Any Western clich\u00e9 that you can think of is either given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. For example there is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his brother, a sincere Priest, and turns platitudes upside down. The brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior, but Tuco punches back and says, \"Where we come from there were only two ways out. You lacked the courage to do what I've done.\" The movie is also irreverently funny: For example, Twice Tuco gained the upper hand on Blondie and said:\n\n\"There are two kinds of spurs(?), my friend. Those that come in by the door, and (crosses himself) those that come in by the window.\"\n\n\"There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting.\" Later Blondie gained the advantage of Tuco and observed:\n\n\"You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend - those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig.\" In addition to all these specific attributes, a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the entire film: long scenes of tense silences \u0096 never for an instant boring; and telling, startling close-ups and transitions. Most noteworthy was the film's climax. As the protagonists stand there with their fingers on their holsters, waiting for the first person to go for their gun(s), the transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this, I wish I had my own copy of the film, just so I could see this scene again.\n\nNot just a great western, but easily one of the best movies of *any* kind ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or the Good, the Better and the Best, as I prefer calling it, is a bizarrely sublime and a uniquely aesthetic masterpiece. The actors in title roles have given such extraordinarily superb performances, that it would be impertinent and disparaging to merely regard their swell work as acting. In fact their brilliant portrayals have immortalized Blondie, Sentenza/ Angel Eyes and the enigmatic Tuco. Lee Van Cleef is fiendishly unforgiving as the merciless Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood is rugged yet suave, cocky yet adorable as laconic cigar-smoker Blondie, a role that laid the foundations of his illustrious career. But it is Eli Wallach, who steals the show with his captivating portrayal of Tuco, a portrayal that is as entrancing as it is enlightening. Wallach is amusing, capricious, nonchalant, uncanny and yet tenacious as Tuco, perturbed by his insecurities and dampened by his solitude. It is the tacit amicability between Blondie and Tuco and their mutual hostility towards the evil Angel Eyes owing to the vestiges of virtue present in them, redolent of their moribund morality, which gives the story, the impetus and the characters, a screen presence that is not only awe inspiring but also unparalleled.\n\nSergio Leone's magnificent and ingenious direction in synergy with Ennio Morricone's surreal music, Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking cinematography and Joe D'Augustine's punctilious editing makes the movie, a treat to watch and ineffably unforgettable. Initially aimed to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, continues to stand the test of time in its endeavor to attain apotheosis (if it hasn't attained it yet). It will always be remembered as European cinema's greatest lagniappe, not only to the Western genre, but to the world of cinema.\n\nIt's a must watch for any movie lover. 10/10"

It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy doing so.\n\nThe music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact, it probably already is, even if you haven't seen the movie! The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song \"Ecstacy of Gold\" is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just incredible.\n\nThe story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is long, but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.\n\nLee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor, and he is incredible as \"Angel Eyes.\" It is the part he was born to play. Eli Wallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people say he steals the show, and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is excellent as \"Blondie,\" although I don't think Eastwood has as strong of a presence as Van Cleef (I know many will disagree, and that's OK because all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?).\n\nThis movie is hypnotic. It's operatic. It's sad. It's funny. It's gritty. It's violent. It's art. It's action. It's pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western. If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you are doing, and go get it now!!"

First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.\n\nSergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.\n\nThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Sergio Leone always wanted every picture he made to be, in every way, bigger than the one which preceded it. With the Good, the Bad and the Ugly he continued his upward trajectory and rounded off his dollars trilogy in style.\n\nThis picture was Leone's most stylised and grandiose to date, and brought all the themes and styles he had been developing in his earliest films to perfection. Among the most notable was his characterisation, particularly his all-important introductions of characters. Look at the introductory scenes of the three leads. We first see Tuco bursting out of a window, obviously interrupted in the middle of a meal, and straight away we get his freeze-frame and the title \"the ugly\" \u0096 this is a simple character, and needs no further introduction. Angeleyes appears out of the distance, but grows towards us until his face fills the screen. We see him commit two despicable acts of murder and treachery before we get his freeze-frame and title \"the bad\", telling us he is pure evil. Finally, in Blondie's first appearance he steps into the frame from behind the camera, as if he had always been there. He rescues Tuco, but only for his own profit. It's not until we have seen him betray and abandon Tuco that we get his freeze-frame and title \"the good\" \u0096 obviously a fairly ironic label given the way he has just acted.\n\nLeone's trademark long drawn out face-offs \u0096 exaggerated versions of the shootouts of John Ford westerns and the sword duels of Kurosawa's samurai films \u0096 are also brought to a peak here. Not only are they now taken to absurd heights of stylisation, they are also spread out and adapted to cover the whole picture, until the point where even two men sitting opposite each other eating a meal and glancing suspiciously at one another is treated like another stand off. In fact, the entire film can be considered one long series of duels.\n\nWe also see more of the importance Leone attaches to church and family. The Dollars trilogy could be thought to lack emotion, taking place as it does in a world where there are no morals and everyone is out for gold. However the Good, the Bad and the Ugly contains several moments of poignancy, perhaps the most prominent of which is when Tuco confronts his estranged priest brother.\n\nReligious iconography and references crops up time and again. Leone loved biblical epics almost as much as he loved westerns, and there is something of the feel of those pictures here in the overwhelming landscapes and eerie, choral music. On top of this the central trio can be read as an allegory for God, the Devil and humanity. This arguably presents rather a cynical view of the Catholic faith \u0096 given the treacherous and chequered nature of the \"good\" \u0096 but it could be argued to be a typically Italian one. In a country in which the church is so omnipresent and universally accepted, it's sometimes said that God is cursed as much as loved. Having said that, this was clearly never intended as the central theme \u0096 Leone wasn't trying to make some grand statement here \u0096 it's simply part of the mix of ideas going on in this picture.\n\nThis brings me onto the war theme. Anti-war sentiments are not directly addressed in this picture, but the way the civil war is woven into the plot makes a powerful statement. For the first half hour we don't see that the war is going on. The central characters aren't concerned with the it \u0096 they are only interested in hunting down the gold. However the war encroaches on the plot more and more often, until it moves from background to foreground and takes over the entire picture, culminating in a colossal battle scene. And of course the fact that the film ends in a huge military graveyard is also very significant.\n\nI've spent so long talking about the themes and ideas going on in this film I've nearly run out of space to talk about all the genius that has gone into making it so enjoyable. The dialogue is superb, often funny and plenty of it quotable. Technically Leone has perfected his art \u0096 he composes a shot like John Ford, edits like Eisenstein, paces like Kurosawa, but all with a degree of his own originality. There is brilliant acting \u0096 Eli Wallach steals it as Tuco, probably his best ever performance. It's funny how Lee Van Cleef was cast as a villain here. Van Cleef's early career mostly involved playing mean-looking gang members, but as Leone discovered when casting him as the hero in For a Few Dollars More, while his face said \"bad guy\" his voice and manner could be warm and likable. The good guy Van Cleef obviously proved more popular, as in the dozen or so other spaghetti westerns he made for other directors he was invariably cast as the hero.\n\nJust time for a final word on the recent (2003) restored edition. While it's great that several lost scenes have been added, I have to say that very few of them were entirely necessary. The only one of the added scenes I really like is the one in which Angeleyes visits the field hospital \u0096 it keeps his story arc going, and also shows an act of compassion from the \"bad\" when he lets the soldier keep the bottle. However the new dubbing for these scenes, strange as it may seem considering today's technology, is mixed absolutely atrociously. On top of this, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are now so elderly, they actually sound less convincing than the guy impersonating the late Lee Van Cleef. As a result the restored segments stick out like sore thumbs, and break up the flow of what is in every other way a perfect motion picture."

What had changed?\n\nFor one thing, I took more notice of the technical side of the film. I paid attention to Leone's famous use of close-ups, his selection of memorable character actors, and his wonderful scene-setting. I admired the detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes, the props and the costumes and all those weird, wonderful faces that Leone clearly loved to photograph.\n\nI also got hooked by some of the quieter moments that I had skipped over in my first viewing. One of the most effective scenes involves Eli Wallach's character, Tuco, quarreling with his brother when they meet after they've been apart for years. Their argument is great, emotionally charged stuff, made all the more effective by the suggestion that they really do love and care about each other. It's the kind of sensitive, human scene you never get to see in a Tarantino or Rodriguez movie.\n\nBefore I get too fuzzy-wuzzy, I should also like to point out that, on my second viewing, I LOVED all the action, too. Every gunfight is great, in its own way, and they're all a bit different. The greatest of them all is, of course, the final confrontation between the trio, which is accompanied by some of the most rousing music I've ever heard in a film. And hey, there's even a huge Civil War battle to provide a change of pace from all the small-scale action.\n\nUltimately, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is probably just a potboiler of a film, without too much to say about, for example, the human condition. But what a potboiler! It doesn't have to try to be cool - it simply IS cool. In fact, it probably defined heroic coolness for an entire generation. Eli Wallach's performance, Leone's direction and Morricone's music alone are enough to elevate it to classic status - and the fact that everything else in the movie is great, too, helps elevate it to the level of perhaps the greatest action film ever made.\n\nAnd to think, I missed all that the first time through..."

Nearly every great movie is carried by some drama between characters.\n\nYes it has a little bit drama. It shows the greediness of humanity just like The Treasue of Sierra Madre. It refletcs conflicts between three different types of men. Also I love how Eastwood's character is nameless in The Man Without Name Trilogy. Sometimes the trilogy also called The Dollar Trilogy.\n\nBesides the storyline the techincs are breathtaking.\n\nActing performances are just breathtaking. If you didn't notice that much of acting skills, then you should check Trivias of the movie.\n\nThe Scores just one of the bests. Morricone just made the most iconic scores. From that time until now, every Western score has his iconic type.\n\nSet decoration is about something enormous in this movie. They really did something great with that too.\n\nCostume design and makeups are also so good. You can see it in the battle scenes and in the desert scenes.\n\nSound is really good, the only decent thing is Film Editing. Especially in the Extended Versions some flaws appears."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the original Leone \"Italian Westerns\" that quickened the pulse of a young Quentin Tarantino.\n\nSometimes I think I am living in a time warp. I watched all the Leone films in theatres in real time and was mesmerized, gob-smacked, and exhilarated. Now in the far future (2016) I watch QT do his knock-offs, and the young audiences (who have never seen the originals) think his are the originals, and everything else the knockoffs.\n\n(Reminds me of the Old King Cole nursery rhyme -- \"pulled out a plum and said What a Good Boy Am I\" -- another reference lost on those living the age of portable devices.)\n\nFor those who actually care about the history of film:\n\n* Leone invented a brand new genre called the Italian western. His first, Fistful of Dollars, recycled a Japanese story (Yojimbo), recycled an American ex-pat whose Hollywood career was officially over (Eastwood) and introduced one of the greatest music composers of the modern film era, Ennio Morricone.\n\n* next came For a Few Dollars More, an original story, which locked into film history Leone's trademark use of closeups and sound editing, and brought out of mothballs Lee Van Cleef, one of the greatest \"faces\" in the history of the western. (\"Angel Eyes\" in this one.)\n\n* with two international hits under his belt, Leone aimed for the stars and created this movie which marks his legacy. While simultaneously continuing the tradition he started, and using the two stars from his second film, he gave Eli Wallach (an A-list star from the 1950s) the role of his career. Wait there is more. He set the story against the backdrop of the Civil War and manged to make the transitions seamless and brutally compelling. it is simultaneously a violent film and an anti-war film at the same time! (The only film of Leone's that may compete with this one is Once Upon a Time in America, also reviewed by this writer on the IMDb).\n\nBy modern standards the film is overlong and, had it been produced in America (as was indeed the case with Upon a Time in America), the \"suits\" would have butchered it down to 100 minutes. Luckily for the rest of us, this was an international release, cut-proof, and survives very nicely to the present day in its original form.\n\nQT was a young lad when these films appeared but the impact is clear. He used Morricone's music in Kill Bill (his best film in my view) and in my view The Hateful Eight tries to emulate the power of Leone but falls somewhat short.\n\nFor you youngsters out there, I recommend these films as some of the most entertaining efforts ever set to film, period. Imitated but not duplicated.\n\nAstonishing, mind-blowing, unforgettable."

How do I remember a baseball game, it was the night Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth's homerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into the the baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool. 'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemed like an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is Movie History. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25 times. Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory. Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself in the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the people that defined \"The Western\". On a scale of 1-10, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is nothing less than a 10. Plop the tape into the VCR, sit back and experience a classic."

        "review_title": "While I'm getting along with most of favourable reviews here, yet suggesting a view with a twist",
        "review_detailed_main": "Much like John Ford's \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962) ranks among my favourite classic westerns, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1966), directed by Italian director Sergio Leone, ranks among my favourite Italian Spaghetti westerns, as well as among any other epigonic westerns, also jokingly, often contemptuously, definitely gastronomically called Paella, Sauerkraut, Borscht, Ramen... westerns. It easily takes the best movie top spot.\n\nFirst of all, it came at the right time in my life, at the tender age of 9, in a, then, safe environment on the outskirts of Sarajevo, where in the year of local distribution of the film (1968) I lived. I was already allowed to attend cinema shows with my peers only; i.e., without the company of grown ups. In addition to Disney's animated and live-action features, as well as true-life adventure documentaries, rerun of the older Charlie Chaplin's and Laurel & Hardy's (Stanlio & Olio) comedies and Johnny Weissmuller's exotic Tarzan escapades, westerns were the favourite film genre of my early childhood (and remained among my favourites even to my advanced adulthood, nowadays senior citizenship). It is easy to understand that. Western, mostly taking place in the wide open, often insufficiently explored, ergo exciting spaces, is the simplest paradigm of constant opposition between good and bad/evil (virtues and vices), here exemplified already in the title, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", where ugly is added for the sake of nuancing between the other two; i.e., adding \"colour\" in otherwise only a \"black-and-white\" confrontation. This simplification is further explicated and enforced by numerous, often humorous instances of \"two kinds of\" (people, spurs...) in the film story itself.\n\nFrom the initial controversial, often lukewarm, sometimes even negative reception, as years and decades passed by film has been more often and then exclusively praised, ultimately glorified as a real masterpiece. And rightly so. If not for other reasons than for impressively orchestrated the main three characters ensemble, accompanied with able support cast, then for Leone's signature filming style, mixing extreme face close-ups and sweeping long shots, coordinating camera and character movements to match the music, often imitating the natural sounds, precomposed by Leone's already regular collaborator Ennio Morricone, demystifying the nostalgia for the Old West, as well as the American Civil (and any other) War, by emphasizing violence and cruelty, greed and stupidity... just to mention a few, already described numerous times elsewhere.\n\nBut, has anyone ever asked yourself why the movie was named the way it was? Well, I'll be getting there in the shortest while.\n\nFilm begins in the waste land of the Wild West, where, each one in his own story, we first meet the fugitive Mexican bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach), whose episode, in which he survives clash with the three bounty hunters upon his trail, ends with a stop shot of him entitled \"the ugly\". The ruthless mercenary \"Angel Eyes\" (Lee Van Cleef), who, when paid, always follows his job through, is also characterized by the title in the last frame of his opening story, a stop shot of him reads \"the bad\". Finally, the bounty hunter \"Blondie\" (Clint Eastwood) enters the scene, who first rescues Tuco from another group of three bounty hunters, and then hands him over to the local authorities in exchange for a reward. But it's only a ruse, because Blondie will save Tuco just before the execution of the death sentence by hanging. The two outlaws share the prize and decide to do it all again. After another successful con, Blondie abandons Tuco and leaves him in the desert. While Tuco calls him names and threatens to kill him, Blondie ponders: \"Such ingratitude, after all the times I've saved your life.\" A stop frame of him then reads \"the good\". Tuco swears revenge, so he captures Blondie at the first opportunity and banishes him to the desert. There, they both run into a dying officer of the soon to be defeated Southern Confederacy, who reveals to them the secret of $200,000.00 in golden coins hidden in a cemetery. The cruel Angel Eyes is also searching for this treasure...\n\nIn the further course of the story, the alliances between the three title characters shift, as and when it suits them. All three heroes turn out to be anti-heroes, who kill solely for personal gain.\n\nAnd now the earlier mentioned title-related question easily arises--suggested also by my high school classmate Drazen-Hamza, when we re-watched the film a decade after its initial release--WHY IS THE GOOD GUY GOOD, THE BAD GUY BAD, and, as an in-between, THE UGLY GUY UGLY?\n\nExplanations are many, one as valid as another, but a particular one strikes me as somewhat more compelling. Stripped to its core, as Drazen-Hamza noticed, it all comes to who shoots better, who kills more. THE GOOD ONE IS GOOD because in the course of the film story HE KILLS 11 MEN, while THE BAD ONE IS BAD (as in weak, inferior, rather than as in evil) because HE KILLS ONLY 3 MEN and loses the direct (though partially fixed) confrontation and his life in a triple showdown. At the same time, THE UGLY (nasty, rather than unsightly) ONE \"SCORES\" the number of kills between the other two; i.e., 6 FATAL VICTIMS of his shooting. AS SIMPLE AS THAT!\n\nFinally, rewatching \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is as pleasing as--if not more than--any earlier watching, because it's one of those precious movies where you enjoy knowing what's next and remembering clever, often humorous, even sarcastic dialogues and replicas, but also always discover something new, that had escaped your attention before, so it easily deserves its top rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must admit that I had some doubts prior to seeing this movie, considering its length and some people's comments that it is slow as molasses. Well, they were mostly right about that. GB & U is indeed a movie that does not always move very fast, and it does take a little getting used to. Yet if you manage to look past the slowness, this is easily one of the best movies ever made.\n\nThis is one of those movies where nearly everything comes together in exactly the right way. First of all, there is a wonderful cast of characters. Clint Eastwood is at his best as the 'Good' (even though he's not strictly a good guy but more a bad guy with an honor code), Lee van Cleef is so truly evil that you'll long for his downfall with a passion, and Eli Wallach steals the show as the 'Ugly', turning him into a character that you'll root for even though he's quite clearly the least trustworthy character you'll ever meet.\n\nThese wonderful characters engage in a quite complex plot full of twists and turns, as they are constantly trying to outwit and outshoot each other. There's quite a lot going on and in spite of the fact that the tone of the movie is actually fairly light (there is some truly good humor), it's actually a fairly good exploration of human nature and the lengths to which people will go to achieve their goals.\n\nAnd then, there's the music of course. Ennio Morricone has always composed some very distinct and recognizable tunes, which unfortunately were not always that great by themselves. The music here, however, is absolutely one of the most memorable scores ever.\n\nOf course, the cinematography is wonderful as well. The production values here seem to be a lot higher than in some previous Leone movies, and GB & U contains plenty of memorable shootouts that will truly keep you on the edge of your seat. At the same time, the gunmen here seem not nearly as invincible as in some other Leone movies, which greatly adds to the suspense.\n\nAs I said before, nearly everything comes together in this movie. Sure, it might be a bit slow, but it's got a great story of good versus evil, told in an impressive and truly epic way, with memorable characters and shootouts everywhere. Highly recommended"

While I don't even think it's the best thing Sergio Leone made, it's a solid Spaghetti Western that has all but transcended the sub-genre. There are images, such as Clint Eastwood in the poncho, and music, like the main title theme, that are known by people who have never seen the movie. I also know people who wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie made outside of the USA who love The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I can't think of another Italian made film, let alone an Italian made Western, that has become so universally known and enjoyed.\n\nThere are so many moments in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that I enjoy. One of my favorites is that of Tuco running through the cemetery as Morricone's \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" plays in the background. It literally gives me goosebumps. It's one of those movie moments that I look forward to no matter how many times I've seen them. I'm also a fan of the techniques Leone used in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Leone's use of the widescreen shots of the landscape inter-cut with extreme close-ups of faces is brilliant. It adds a sense of intimacy to vastness of the setting that allows the viewer feel like they're part the movie and gain some insight into the characters. It's a technique that very few other filmmakers have the guts to employ.\n\nBut I sincerely doubt that Leone's film would be so widely and wildly regarded if it weren't for the music of Ennio Morricone. I've already mentioned the main title theme and \"The Ecstasy of Gold\", but these are only two examples found in this amazing score. Can you imagine the final showdown without Morricone's music? I can't think of many instances where music and film go together to create such tension and anticipation. I've already used the word \"brilliant\" to describe Leone, but it's also applicable to Morricone.\n\nFinally, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly wouldn't be the same without the three lead actors. Each, at least in this movie, is brilliant (there's that word again) in his own right. Clint Eastwood is \"The Good\". He's \"The Good\" in the sense that he's not as \"bad\" as the other two. Lee Van Cleef is \"The Bad\". He's a ruthless killer who would just as soon shoot you as look at you - as long as the price was right. And then there's Eli Wallach as \"The Ugly\". As good as Eastwood and Van Cleef are, Wallach is really something special. Wallach's Tuco is one of the most crazed, but complicated characters I've seen. It's a special cast for a very special movie."

Also, it's a spoiler free review, and it may seem to be a little vague.\n\nGood : It's a masterpiece. Don't agree with me? I don't care at all. Leone's visual storytelling has never been so great. The scores, the activities of the characters, the scenes were enough to tell the story. The dialogues are simply conversations between the characters. In the entire three hour runtime, there isn't a single expositionary dialogue, except for a total of 5 minutes. That's a very difficult task to do, and it does it with such an ease that we don't even notice it during the first viewing. Many difficult scenes have been shot very perfectly, which feels really obvious. There are a few point of view shots which makes it more interesting. The characterizations given to each of the three lead characters justify them as good, bad and ugly. There are many moments which justify their characterizations. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach have done a complete justice to their roles. This movie, being set in the American Civil War, has some elements of it. However, it doesn't glorify the war and doesn't take any side. It portrays war as one of the worst things - just like in the way it should be. The war scenes are too damn good. Well choreographed and incredible cinematography. You can see a whole bunch of people engaging, and it obviously was not CGI. It wasn't really necessary to show all of that, but it did and it was great (Sergio Leone rocks!). The violence does feel real and legit, in contrast to many of the older Westerns. Last but the important thing would be music, Ennio Morricone's score is entirely of next level good. Incomprehensibly great. It complements every scene and either escalates the tension (eg. the final showdown) or just develops emotional and dramatic factors. Also, contrary to this, there are some moments of silence which serve similar purpose of escalating the tension and drama. The music is so good that even if you (somehow) end up not liking the film, you will definitely love the score by Morricone. It has absolutely no negatives whatsoever. It deserves every bit of praise it receives.\n\nConclusion : This is the Citizen Kane of Westerns. Every Western film (not necessarily Spaghetti) is compared with this. There is a reason why. This is a highly recommended film not only for Western lovers, but for every movie lover out there. As for me, I heard a lot of great things about it, then, I was ready to be disappointed, but I was blown away by it. It was way above my initial expectations, and delivered a lot more than that. Recently, only Infinity War managed to do so. It is a gem of a movie.\n\nRating.\n\nScore : absolute 10/10\n\nGrade : A+"

        "review_title": "Masterfully shot; masterfully scored; masterfully directed, Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a stunning and highly involving piece - just masterful.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Sergio Leone's 1966 Western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly unfolds under this hostile, violent and hate filled umbrella of Civil War America; a fitting backdrop of ongoing warfare and hostilities to which two American men and a Mexican bandit strive to find a large box full of valuable coins buried out in the big country somewhere behind Confederate Army lines. In using a plot item as routine as said example and applying it to a relatively routine singular strand arc for the film's narrative to take, Leone essentially breathes so much life into a set up and plot plan that about half way through you forget the basic bare bones of the movie and find yourself going with it, utterly immersed in the tale the director's laying out in front of you. So much has been written and said about the film, like other such examples at the top of each genre, that further comment and analysis may seem futile. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly may very well be the pinnacle to the western as Psycho might be to horror or Apocalypse Now to the war, for instance. If it isn't, or either of the said examples aren't, then there will still be a large cluster of individuals that would sternly argue otherwise.\n\nThe film begins with a loud and confrontational title sequence, a brash and expansive manner in which to announce your film has arrived; the sort that sees a flashing of character faces and arrays of different colour, a sequence in which even the little animated horse gets the full force of a cannonball that's been fired off. It sets the tone for a no holds barred ride of guns; gunslingers and no nonsense people with no nonsense attitudes as observations of greed and that of both a mid and post-war crumbling society plays out. The film features some of the best direction I've ever seen; Leone's ability to shift gears and change the film's tact from one thing to another, as loyalties shift and events take a turn for the different is near-flawless. His ability to essentially construct a number of small, minute set-pieces amidst this wide-open and dusty, hostile setting is immaculate; but the change of tact he applies later on towards the end of the film in capturing a Civil War battle between the North and South is just as impressive; portraying a larger fight sequence as the inevitable showdown between the film's three main players draws nearer and that sense their showdown will be of a similarly epic proportion, despite it being just another gunfight and despite the fact all of those thus far have been between grossly outmatched participants.\n\nLeone is all for spectacle and action to propel the plot, but his ability to capture the little things; the terrain and just the sounds that it omits is wonderful. The introduction of Angel Eyes, aka The Bad (van Cleef), for instance sees a young boy flee into his house on first sight of him as he arrives; Angel Eyes' boots stomping on a stone floor whilst he approaches an elderly man sitting at a table as a dog barks outside, all of it a routine use of composition and SFX, but the drawn out editing process; the fact a kid ran for his life at first sight of him and the semiotical driven noise of a barking dog which suggests a rabid animal or ominousness build the scene and character without anyone ever explaining or saying anything.\n\nThey call him The Bad because he shoots without mercy and takes without conscience, leaving a family in tatters and on another occasion beats a girl to a near pulp until she gives him what info he's looking for. The name Angel Eyes is wholly ironic. This makes Clint Eastwood's 'Good' (aka Blondie) and Wallach's 'Ugly' (aka Tuco) perhaps look more favourable than they actually are when it's revealed they're mostly in it together against this blackly dressed; father/husband murdering; woman slapping figure of evil. Tuco and Blondie's relationship is a strange one, a mutual appreciation of one another and the death they leave in their wake. Tuco would no sooner shoot Blondie, than hang him, than act like they're best friends. No longer is 'The Good' of a western limited to wearing the sheriff's badge and/or cleaning up towns of drunks and no-good varmints; as here, 'The Good' would much rather come across as upstanding; fleece a local sheriff of $2,000 and then make off with the cash against the guy he was initially in tow with.\n\nTuco's raging attitudes are captured in a single shot that encompasses a sketching of Christ on the cross as he swigs alcohol whilst wearing an eye-patch, the film at a point where Tuco seems to be doing good in aiding an old friend but perhaps with a traitorous eye still on the prize as the patch acts as a visual distinction of the two sides of his face doubling up as his sinful and righteous attitudes, whereas he gives the Holy Trinity throughout. But THE scene that encapsulates his character is in a store early on during which, betrayed and foaming at the mouth for revenge, he fondles some handguns in front of an elderly clerk before angrily discarding them. He then fondles some more and asks for bullets, drawing you into the scene in an utterly effective manner and its threat element within as we wonder what he has in store for the clerk above all else. There's a solid hour of character involvement and some set-piece exchanges which work wonderfully well; and a later juxtaposition between diegetic musical content with an interrogation brought a smirk to my face when I realised whom it was that felt so inspired to pay homage to such a sequence. The film is engrossing, rich in detail on so many levels and an absolute outright winner of a piece."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sergio Leone is an underappreciated talent. His skill, in most cases, exceeds what he actually puts on the screen. This is, by far, his crowning achievement and the culmination of both his work and Clint Eastwood's career. After this, it is only pushing the plateau without success.\n\nThe primary focus of this movie is not the characters, the story winds up being the least of Leone's concerns. Instead, he is concerned about the camera and the music. Ennio Morricone, a genius in his own right, was seriously ignored by the Academy for his compilation here--certainly one of the Top 10 ever. He understands the crude editing of the mid-60s and exploits everything he can from the vision onscreen. If Leone was dissatisfied with the Ennio's final product, something MUST have been wrong with him.\n\nThe camera is another element that never lies. Modern filmmakers should study this before they try emulating MTV next time. With Leone's grandeur and a cast that understands that they aren't the real focus, how can he lose?\n\nThe story, while it isn't the greatest, is better delivered than such works as The Wild Bunch. Perhaps only High Noon understands the value of pacing and what to reveal/not reveal to the audience. Then again, Fred Zinnemann is an entirely different director. The character interaction here is certainly better than what Gary Cooper has to offer, not to mention the dialog includes some uncanny deliver by Eli Wallach.\n\nOverall, a classic. This is a definer of the unconventional Western and visual literature. 4.5 out of 5 stars. A must see."

        "review_detailed_main": "While I have given some pretty long reviews to Clint Eastwood's Westerns--particularly the wonderful FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, I will only give a brief review of this movie because there are so many reviews already I doubt if my pontificating will actually influence many people. After all, this is widely seen as one of the greatest Westerns ever made and since I liked it immensely, there isn't much need to say more.\n\nWell, there are actually a few Westerns I liked a bit more--I am a HUGE fan of THE BIG COUNTRY. But, when it comes to style, originality and the epic proportions of this film, none can match it, though ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST comes very, very close. The acting and script are just fine and the music is intensely weird but effective. Of all the films I have seen with music by Ennio Morricone, this is his most intense and strangest. And it works perfectly in this film, but I also appreciate much of his more restrained work in other films and would never want all Westerns to have such distinctive and bizarre music as in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY--it would just lose its magic and might even tend to overwhelm the film.\n\nAbout the only negatives about this film are the title and it is a pretty violent film that the little ones probably shouldn't watch. There is a lot of blood and violence and you do get to see (yuck) Eli Wallach's butt. As for the title, sure, Lee Van Cleef was truly \"BAD\" and Eli Wallach was cure \"UGLY\", but Clint as \"the GOOD\"? Well, his character was far from good--but of course, who would like the title to be \"The Kinda Good, The Bad And the Ugly\"?! Not to be missed by any serious fan or the genre."

Sergio Leone then set this story against a backdrop of the American civil war. It is visually stunning, and has enough action for 10 films, let alone 1. Okay, so its not geographically or historically correct, but seriously, if you care about those things so much that you don't like the film, then you are just plain sad. The 3 main characters are excellent; Clint Eastwood as the laid back hero, Eli Wallach as his dirty Mexican partner and Lee van Cleef as the evil gunman who kills for a living. The whole film is like a work of art, leading up to the final gunfight in a stadium like cemetery, 1 of the best scenes in film history. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly isn't one of those films that is thought provoking, but it is one of the best simply because for 3 hours it is very entertaining, and a thing of beauty."

Such is the case here, with the plot being a race between the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood), a hired gun named Angel Eyes (van Cleef), and the Man with No Name's on-again off-again sidekick Tuco (Eli Wallach) to find a cache of stolen gold during the Civil War. This plot meanders for two and three-quarters hours before getting on track, and that's about an hour and three-quarters too long. The subplots are never developed, nor are the characters. Tuco switches allegiances every ten minutes. After a while, it gets just plain boring.\n\nDefinitely could have used a good editor. Eastwood's westerns got better with age (his, not theirs); Unforgiven and Pale Rider are better, tighter films. **"

Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef in the Fall of 1968. I was quite the little existentialist then; \"If it feels good, DO IT!\" was the mantra of my high school Senior English teacher. Well, it felt good, and bad, and ugly. I ended up dropping out of Northwestern after Kent State and, taking the soundtrack of GBU (in my head) with me to Vietnam in 1971, I proceeded to get a real-world education in the old 'ultra-violence' as an infantryman in the AMERICAL Division... WHAT you may ask does this have to do with an American Civil War movie, directed and written by an Italian Communist? (Sergio Leone's daddy may have been more of a commie than Sergio was, but the fact is that \"A Fistful of Dollars\" was STOLEN from Kurosawa, while \"The Magnificent Seven\" was PURCHASED years before. The end justifies the means? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?) http://www.fistful-of-leone.com/classic/articles/prof.html I found out firsthand the moral ambiguities of war. If only I had paid attention to the subtext in GBU! If only I had studied the Matthew Henry battlefield dead tintypes as Leone so obviously had! His hideous, rotting carcases of Union and Confederate soldiers, bloating in direct sunlight, would have sufficiently revulsed me from any notion that I could 'play soldier' and survive! But here I am, having just barely survived.... and I just got out of the fabulous Fox Theater here in Atlanta where the restored GBU was projected in all its Technicolor/Technirama glory at fully loaded, screaming Morricone volume.... there must have been at least a thousand people there, and hardly anyone moved. INCREDIBLE. It is said that the movie was made to the tunes Morricone made prior to production's start; i.e. Leone played the music while shooting the scenes! Hence, these epics are giant music videos - fantasias - symphonic cinema- they are huge, elegiac tone poems! And, God help me, I still love this movie."

So, I saw the movie and till date I have watched it at least 25 times. Hats off to Sergio Leone for making such a great and legendary movie and that too in 1966 with limited resources. None of the \"Spagetti Westerns\" are close such brilliance, not even the other 2 in this series. Leone has extracted out a stupendous performance from \"Eli Wallach\". Clint Eastwood was good as usual. Shooting locations are brilliant and the supportive background score is very catchy. The movie is a bit slow in the beginning, but once it catches pace, it deeply involves the audience. Some people have argued that #4 is too high for this movie, but its not 'some' who make the IMDb list, its the majority. Speaking of Leone, I believe that he was at least 15-20 years ahead of time. He has served as inspirations for such genre in all parts of the world, be it 'Sholay' in India, 'El Desaro' in Spain, and many more. I would like to go with a 9 out of 10 for this movie and its a flick which you just can't afford to miss this"

The Good, The Bad and the Ugly has so much good about it, and quintessentially it is one of the best westerns ever made. There may be nothing new about the story at first glance, but that's the point, Leone is paying homage to the Hollywood western, and despite the initial simplicity there is also a complexity mainly in the film's characters. Regardless of whether simple or complex it is, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly does have a compelling and brilliantly written story.\n\nBut there are other assets that make The Good, The Bad and the Ugly so good. The dialogue is always excellent, while Leone's direction is superb once again. The characters are great and are superbly played. Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever here, and Eli Wallach is perfectly cast and more than a match for him. I was also very impressed with Lee Van Cleef, who I recognised from High Noon and such, but he makes a bigger impression here. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is also the most violent of the trilogy, and one of the most violent of the genre, not a bad thing whatsoever.\n\nThe pace was spot on too, even though the film is nearly three hours long, it is never boring or dull. The best things though about The Good, The Bad and the Ugly are the visuals and Ennio Morricone's score. The film looks amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous and the sweeping images and scenery are very lovingly crafted. Morricone's score is even more impressive than that, it is simply one of the best film scores I've ever heard, and if I had to say which was Morricone's best score, I would immediately say this.\n\nOverall, there is nothing bad or ugly about the film. The film is amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

That leaves cold-hearted killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) as 'The Bad', which he most definitely is, even going so far as to kill a child in order to achieve his goals. After Blondie and Tuco chance upon a dying Confederate soldier who reveals to them the whereabouts of a fortune in gold, the pair come to the attention of Angel Eyes, who will do anything to lay his hands on the treasure.\n\nThe Good, The Bad and The Ugly, the third film in Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy, is an epic spaghetti western that benefits from iconic central characters, an undeniable sense of cool, and, of course, that classic Ennio Morricone soundtrack (Waaawawah, waa waa waa!). Where the film doesn't fare quite so well is in the pacing and storytelling, the basic plot\u2014three guys go in search of hidden treasure\u2014stretched painfully thin, particularly in the Extended Cut, which clocks in at approximately three hours. The expansive historical backdrop\u2014the American Civil War\u2014frequently detracts from the flow of the story and Leone has a tendency to labour a little too much over his style, lingering on his characters for an eternity and repeating similar shots ad nasueum, all of which causes scenes to drag. Fortunately, some nice touches of humour and a couple of neat plot twists help to make matters a little easier to digest.\n\n6/10. Not quite as hard-going as Once Upon A Time In The West, but not a patch on the earlier Dollars movies, or indeed, Leone's underrated A Fistful of Dynamite."

        "review_detailed_main": "A big, bravado, bold and exquisite film for its time, Sergio Leone's \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" remains one of the most seminal, influential, and exciting films of all time. With its superb cast, its beautiful and wide scenery, and its superior action sequences, this film is a masterpiece. A picture that embodies the perfect personification of masculinity. A true man's picture, and one that will stand tall among most movies today.\n\nThe simple tale of how three gunslingers form an unlikely alliance of hate, in order to find $200,000 (that's $6 million by today's standards) worth of stolen gold, in a country that is ravaged by war, is elegantly told by the maestro of westerns, Sergio Leone. For its time, Spaghetti Westerns were not considered genuine art, but rather, entertainment instead. Sergio Leone is probably the only director who is smart enough to make his film compelling to mainstream and critical audiences alike. His direction is smart and strong, and you see how well his direction is as per the amount of manpower and creativity in handling the action sequences. The action sequences are raw, crisp, grand, explosive, and taut. Especially the Standoff at the end. Leone should probably be awarded a Nobel Prize for that scene alone. Leone is probably why westerns are popular among the youth of the '60s, hell, he probably influenced would be filmmakers at the time. I know of one who was particularly influenced by Leone's direction - Quentin Tarantino himself said that this film is the best-directed film of all time. And yes, although the film may be long, there's not a scene that goes by that you'll say boring.\n\nClint Eastwood - The Good. The legendary Man With No Name. His character perfectly embodies with the true meaning of masculinity. As per in his previous films, he plays a mysterious gunslinger, one with a deadly aim and a strong sense of honor and pride. He is the perfect hero, and this film stands out as one of Clint's, if not his, best film ever.\n\nLee Van Cleef - The Bad. Here, instead of the fatherly Doug Mortimer in the previous \"For A Few Dollars More\", we get the stone-cold assassin Angel Eyes. Van Cleef plays him chillingly to the bone. He is wicked, he is ruthless, he is cruel. He would kill anyone, be it his targets or even his own client.\n\nEli Wallach - The Ugly. He is Tuco, a criminal on the loose. He is the most interesting character in the film, as we see the ugly side of man through him. He is two-faced, slimy, arrogant, and hate-able. But that what makes his character great. There is no substitution for Wallach, he will always be Tuco no matter what.\n\nThe cinematography is absolutely beautiful. We get to see the backdrop of the glorious Wild West and the battlefields of war in all its unfaded glory. Even the cemetery scene is filmed extremely well. The music - that's another thing. The music, is masterful, so sublime, so grandiose, and so haunting. It's mesmerizing, really, to hear the great Ennio Morricone's score while looking at the actions of people, it perfectly matches the film. Not forgetting to mention the iconic and haunting theme song that's embodied itself in popular culture even until today.\n\nSo, yes, this is truly cinematic brilliance. If you want to see the film in all it's glory, I reckon you readers get the extended cut DVD of the film. It's Leone's true version of this film, and it would do you some good to see his true film, not to mention the remastered picture and 5.1 sound so that you can hear the gunshots and explosions in all its fury. Make no mistake readers, this film is one of the most iconic movies ever made, and it can be proud of its status as \"Greatest Western Ever Made\". Now if only movies like these were made today as well...\n\nOverall rating: 10/10\n\nDelton"

Brutal, funny and packed with characters that flow in and out of the narrative without ever feeling disjointed or dashed together. Sergio Leone pushed the boundaries of his previous two westerns and told a tale of three men and their travails through the end of the civil war in search of the hidden gold maguffin. The result was so revolutionary that this movie is burned in the quilt of our culture.The iconic music..Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name...the closeups..everything here is classic. Arguably the best western ever made and certainly the most ambitious."

And, as it has been pointed out as a plot hole, it is an interesting technique that what ever is out of the frame, is unnoticed by the characters, such as Angel Eyes making it all the way to the Stanton grave without being noticed approaching (on horseback) over open land. I found it distracting the way many characters spoke in Spanish or Italian and were dubbed into English. I have always disliked dubbed movies and preferred subtitles, but this one was odd, with some characters speaking English, and some not. It must have made for interesting rehearsals and filming. I would have to agree with others that Eli Wallach largely stole the show. And does anyone know if Lee Van Cleef really was short part of his right middle finger, or did they splice in someone else's hand for that shootout scene?"

(if not the best) Of course, \"Once upon a time in the West\" comes close, but this movie was a bit more thrilling in the end. Personnally, I found that the synergy between Tuco and Blondie was more powerful and interesting than the two protagonists in that film. You care for Tuco, but in the same way Blondie does. In my opinion, his actor performed the best out of the trio. While I watching I couldn't stop thinking about how many newer films got inspired by his character. It seems like everything from Pirates of The Caribbean to Tarantino studied this movie closely to create their worlds. And I'm not complaining, because frankly if more people did, we wouldn't have to deal with so many contrieved story lines."

It is full of action, and not that kind of mainstream action, but the kind of action that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the whole picture! From the excellent soundtrack by the great Ennio Morricone to Sergio Leone's unique direction, this film stands out from the rest. Clint Eastwood gives yet another magnificent performance that in my opinion, has changed cinema. Every scene is shot so beautiful that it makes you \"live\" with the well-sculpted characters. To conclude, \"The good, the bad and the ugly\" is one of those few films that managed to shape cinema throughout its long history. If you haven't watched it yet, you should definitely give it a go asap!!"

Film is quite long, but the non-stop action, Wallach's performance, and rich Civil War backdrop distinguish this one from Clint's earlier Spaghetti Westerns. In fact, this is just about the only one of that genre that I can stand at this point; I saw Once Upon a Tine in the West not too long ago and missed the point entirely. Final showdown is deservingly legendary, as is the musical score. 10 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Clint Eastwood is good, Lee Van Cleef is bad and Eli Wallach is ugly. Sorry about that, Eli. Eastwood again plays the Man with No Name whom we have already seen in A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. Our hero, this time referred to as Blondie, may be \"good\" compared to the other two leading characters but having seen the first two films we know he is not the traditional all-American hero. He's not all good, he's more complex than that. There's not much complexity to Angel Eyes, the character played by Van Cleef. This guy is bad to the bone. Meanwhile Wallach threatens to steal the show. He plays Tuco and this is a guy who, in an otherwise very quiet movie, never shuts up. Good, bad and ugly are searching for $200,000 in Confederate gold known to be buried in a cemetery. It's a very simple plot for a very long movie but the time flies by. Director Sergio Leone ratchets up the tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nThe events of this film, unfolding during the Civil War, actually take place prior to the events of the first two films in the Dollars Trilogy. And the war certainly intrudes on the story, causing complications for our characters in their desperate search for that gold. A big war battle scene lends a bit of grandeur that the first two films didn't have. Leone is making a film of much larger scale this time around. But while the war looms over everything this is still a story about our hero and the two companions he would very much like to be rid of. There are great twists and turns as at different times in the movie different members of the trio have the upper hand. Sometimes you're at the top, sometimes you're at the bottom, sometimes you're forced into an unholy alliance with your great adversary. All along the way there is much drama. And along with the drama there is plenty of action too. This is a movie which grabs your attention right at the start and holds it throughout.\n\nBlondie is the nominal hero, making Eastwood the nominal star. And, as already established in the prior two films, Eastwood suits the role perfectly. He's the perfect embodiment of the quiet, cunning, not totally heroic hero. Van Cleef played a good guy, more or less, in For a Few Dollars More. This time around he gets to play a total baddie and he sinks his teeth into the role with great relish. Wallach is a little over-the-top but delightfully so. Tuco is a crazed, maniacal character and Wallach pours his heart into his performance. He brings so much energy to the film. Three great actors, three great characters. Leone could hardly go wrong. And the film has so much more to offer. With breathtaking visuals and a truly memorable score the film both looks and sounds spectacular. Story, actors, cinematography, music. This film is the total package. It is certainly the best of the Dollars Trilogy, this is the Man with No Name's greatest adventure. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is often found on short lists of the greatest films ever made. That kind of acclaim may be overselling things just a touch. But there is no doubt this is a very good film, a thrilling last chapter in the story of one of the most iconic characters to ever grace the screen."

It made such an impression that I remember where exactly I saw this film, and I enjoyed it on TV a few other times afterward. Now, 40 years later my opinion of it is not the same. The only aspect that I still have a high regard for in here in the music, now considered probably one of the \"classic\" soundtracks.\n\nHowever, the three main characters - the men who dominate this film - played by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef - are really nothing but overly crude and excessively violent morons. The worst, of course, is Wallach's \"Taco.\" He makes me want to take a shower after watching this film! He and Eastwood's \"Blondie\" just take turns brutalizing each other through much of the film. Van Cleef's role is considerably less, as \"Sentzenza\" or \"Angel Eyes.\"\n\nWallach's character is just plain insulting. He is a real lowlife and a horrible witness for anyone of the Catholic faith, which is why they probably emphasize the latter with him genuflecting throughout the film while acting like a complete degenerate. It's another slam on that denomination (of which I am not a member, by the way).\n\nI usually like Director Sergio Leone's long, dramatic, slow shots and good facial closeups Leone keeps his camera so long on one subject that it gets boring. So, there is a rarely a happy medium in this movie: it's either too violently stupid or too slow.\n\nWhat was once \"good\" has now turned \"bad\" and \"ugly.\""

In my opinion this is the greatest and most stylish western ever made. With a superb mix of action, adventure and drama\u0085 and not forgetting the humour.\n\nThe cinematography is brilliantly captivating (will the great mix of flashy camera angles), the music score is downright dynamic & undoubtedly absorbing and the backdrop of the film is simply breath taking.\n\nThis is one truly drawn-out western film that feels so surreal at times. It runs for just under three hours, the pace of the film is quite good for a very long film, as Leone's direction is really top-notch that it just doesn't seem to matter as this film is really compelling and dense that you could watch it over and over again and it would still seem fresh.\n\nThe performances are excellent, Clint Eastwood as the quietly spoken Blondie (the good), Eli Wallach as the humorous Tuco (the ugly) and Lee Van Cleef as the menacing Angel Eyes (the bad). Whenever the three share the screen it's thoroughly imposing and intriguing, though that's greatest thing it doesn't just focus on Eastwood's character- but it has another two strong leads.\n\nThe story is tremendously set in the background of the American Civil war, with its twists and turns, comedic touches between Blondie and Tuco, powerful images and great shoot-outs.\n\nWow, what a spectacular movie this is by Sergio Leone.

I was a bit hesitant at first to watch it because I generally don't care much for Westerns. But it sure was well worth the time.\n\nThe story starts rather slow and throughout the movie there isn't al that much dialogue. The dialogue that is being said though, is absolute gold and the entire movie is filled with memorable quotes that will stick with you for a long time. The cinematography draws you in and combined with the slow pace makes for a unique experience. You get completely lost in the beautiful landscape and it puts you in a place you don't want to get out of. The movie can be considered long, with a runtime of nearly three hours, but you find yourself wishing for more when it is over.\n\nI also wonder if there were ever three more compelling characters put together than 'The Good' (Clint Eastwood), 'The Bad' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'The Ugly' (Eli Wallach). Three completely different characters that work so well together on screen and bring with them a continuous tension that puts you at the edge of your seat. Eastwood's 'Blondie' is the most fascinating character of the three. A man of few words but everything he says and does is coolness personified. He brings with him the illusion of being the good guy and of having a moral center while killing his way to $200,000 in stolen gold.\n\nVan Cleef's 'Angel Eyes' is evil personified in the story. With those menacing eyes you sense right away that he is ruthless in everything he does. But still you're never quite sure what he is up to and he keeps you guessing as to what his next move will be. Wallach's 'Tuco' is a very complex character on his own. Having no problem in lying and deceiving to get what he wants. Yet you can't help to have a little bit of sympathy for him and he is responsible for some of the funniest lines in the movie. \"I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.\"\n\nThe legendary score put together by Ennio Morricone is absolute perfection and brings a perfect sound to the amazing images. Tuco running through the cemetery whilst you hear \"The ecstacy of gold\" is one of the most memorable scenes i've ever seen in cinema. It is hard to find a more perfect half hour on film than the last thirty minutes of this Western epic. How Sergio Leone manages to turn a stare down between three people in to one of the best and most exciting sequences put together is sheer excellence.\n\nGo watch this movie if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did."

        "review_detailed_main": "The above quote is from Bill Hunt, one of America's best-known proponents of 16x9 Enhancement. Having seen this film very briefly on an old VHS tape, and then experiencing it on 16x9 Enhanced DVD, there is just no comparison. It's like looking at the interior of a mansion through a keyhole, then looking through the wide-open door. The scene in which Tuco discovers the graveyard where the pot of gold is buried is a classic example of a scene that loses all of its drama when chopped down just to fit some tiny little narrow screen.\n\nOf course, it's not just the cinematography that earns this film a place in the top 250 of all time. Clint Eastwood's non-existent acting style actually benefits the film, as the less his character says to anyone, the more enigmatic he becomes. Eli Wallach is annoying, but that was the whole idea all along as far as I can tell, and he does this job well. Lee Van Cleef is suitably devilish as \"Angel Eyes\" Setenza, the ultimate expression of the mercenary sensibility concept. They're the only three actors whose roles have any semblance of development, but the style they bring to each role is more than enough to carry the film by itself.\n\nIt's also no accident that the main theme of this film, as well as \"The Ecstasy Of Gold\", the theme we hear during Tuco's hunt for Arch Stanton's grave, are among the most frequently replayed or outright ripped off pieces of film scoring in the history of cinema. The latter is especially powerful, as it takes what would otherwise be a meaningless sequence of a man dashing through a makeshift cemetary into one of the most powerful moments of the film. There's only one other composer I've heard who has performed an equally amazing feat through the use of music - John Williams.\n\nOf course, the best element of this film is that it shows the American Civil War the way it really happened. Slavery was just one element of the war, and a relatively minor one at that. Other elements such as British Loyalism, economic problems, taxation without representation, and general discrimination were the causes of the war. To the everyday man, represented in three different ways by the film's principal characters, the causes of the war were secondary to the opportunities for exploiting either side in order to make a fortune. It has been that way well before the Civil War, and it will always be that way long after the Civil War is long-forgotten. In that sense, this film is less a Western than it is a drama about three greedy men after a pot of gold.\n\nAnd if you want to see the reason why television screens are *finally* being made wider, get the 16x9 Enhanced DVD version of this film that is available in America (NTSC) or Europe/Australia (PAL). Cinematography just doesn't get any finer than this, and neither do dramas with Western motifs."

Look past Clint Eastwood's legend-founding performance and suppose that the central character is actually Eli Wallach's Tuco, the Ugly. A gross rogue, guilty of every possible vice, Tuco is after all the character we see and hear the most, about whom we learn the most, and through whom we experience much of the action. Eli Wallach makes him comic, poignant, and plausible - certainly compared to the unrestrained darkness of Lee Van Cleef and the impossible cool of Eastwood. The film is largely Tuco's struggle to survive, and to earn a little on the side, constantly battered between Eastwood's \"blond Angel\" and Van Cleef's angel of death. Angels? Indeed: Tuco is ultimately human, and Tuco is all of us - grubby, corrupt, uncomfortable and slightly desperate humans, veering between the good and the bad, subject to a perplexing God and an unrelenting Devil, and just trying to muddle along."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie has style - in a very elemental way - so to speak. You get an idea of the deadly, dreary desert, the deadlier bounty hunters and the deadliest of 'em all - Clint Eastwood - the man with no name! The story is a simple one to follow and is brilliantly executed by Sergio Leone using just the right landscapes along with some pretty good sets too (like the one featuring the Civil War sequence). Some of the scenes were meant to be symbolic (especially the Civil War scenes) and they did their job well.\n\nEli Wallach is simply superb with his \"Blondieeee!!!\" screams and curses. Lee Van Cleef seems as deadly as the great Eastwood himself as \"The Bad\" guy.\n\nCinematography - not as continuous as one would like - but manages to convey the tension in the dueling scenes very effectively.\n\nAlso, the music - Ennio Morricone at his best! He has dished out some very innovative and brilliant stuff for all the three \"great\" westerns and this along with \"For a Few Dollars More\" seems to be his best.\n\nFinally, the style! Sergio Leone can certainly teach a thing or two to Quentin Tarantino or The Wachowski Brothers - in fact Tarantino acknowledges Leone's great style. And then the epitome of style himself - Clint Eastwood - with a half-burnt cigar in his lips, unshaven face, tilted hat, ragged jeans, a worn out poncho and the sharpest scowl ever which can rub out any \"Neo-with-million-dollar-goggles\" off the face of the Earth.\n\nNot genre-defining, surely - it was invented by Hollywood. But somebody from Europe really showed the world how to make westerns."

What more can you say about this fabulous movie that hasn't already been said. Not much more. To me the music makes it. I really think this is the greatest sound track of all time. There was a cover version of the title theme by Hugo Montenegro that was No 1 in the UK hit parade for at least 6 weeks and I can remember Jimmy Saville in his Blondie outfit with cheroot introducing the record on Top of The Pops. So this movie, the music and the characters were constantly in the public consciousness and at the office we were constantly using the line \"There are two types of people in the world my friend....\" To all the people who haven't yet seen this movie - lucky you. Do yourself a favor and go and get it. You won't be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) is an epic Italian Western directed by Sergio Leone that has become a milestone in the genre and one of the most influential films in cinema history. Starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach, the movie presents a captivating story set during the American Civil War, where three gunslingers compete to find a fortune in stolen gold.\n\nOne of the film's distinctive features is Leone's ability to create visually stunning sequences. His wide cinematography and use of wide shots and close-ups establish a tense and captivating atmosphere. Additionally, Ennio Morricone's masterfully composed soundtrack enhances the unique cinematic experience, with its instantly recognizable and iconic main theme.\n\nThe screenplay, written by Agenore Incrocci, Furio Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni, Sergio Leone, and Sergio Donati (uncredited), is skillfully crafted, presenting a narrative filled with twists and complex characters. The three protagonists, known as \"the Good,\" \"the Bad,\" and \"the Ugly,\" are portrayed masterfully by Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach, respectively. Each brings their character to life in a memorable way, with Eastwood, in particular, solidifying his position as an icon of the genre.\n\nThe impact of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly on the Western genre is undeniable. While the film is part of Leone's Dollars Trilogy, it goes beyond the boundaries of the spaghetti Western and becomes a masterpiece of cinema as a whole. Leone's revisionist approach, which challenges the traditional conventions of the Western, was instrumental in revitalizing the genre at the time and inspiring future productions.\n\nBy portraying a desolate and lawless West, filled with violence and morally ambiguous characters, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly resonated with audiences of the time and captured the melancholy of the turbulent 1960s. The film's visual style, influenced by Catholic iconography and surrealistic elements, adds layers of depth and meaning to the narrative.\n\nSergio Leone managed to elevate the Western to an art form, surpassing the genre's expectations and creating a lasting cinematic experience. His innovative and daring approach set a new standard for Western films, and its impact can still be felt in the film industry today.\n\nIn summary, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an epic and unforgettable Western that has left an indelible mark on the genre. With its masterful cinematography, iconic soundtrack, engaging narrative, and brilliant performances, Sergio Leone's film remains an essential reference for cinema lovers and a timeless masterpiece that should be appreciated by future generations."

Amid the endless homages and the sheer adoration meted out to Sergio Leone's ambitious, pricier finale to his Spaghetti Western trilogy, it's easy to forget just how damn good the film is. It makes a case for Sergio Leone as a true artist and it slowly reveals itself to have real emotional heft when you begin considering some of the ambitious themes that Leone tackles. Not much needs to be said here. The best western ever made. Its mesmerizing score and epic plot combine to leave any fan of movies in awe."

        "review_title": "One of the Best Westerns Ever Made...",
        "review_detailed_main": "'Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il' was at its release in 1966 a very unconventional Western epic that follows the travails of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen Confederate gold.\n\nAlso known as 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', it was Italian-born (Rome, 3 January 1929) Sergio Leone's third so-called spaghetti Western after 'Per un pugno di dollari', aka 'For a Fistful of Dollars' (1964) and 'Per qualche dollaro in pi\u00f9', aka 'For a Few Dollars More' (1965).\n\nIt is generally considered one of the best films of its kind ever made, a masterpiece, one that almost inexplicably continues to get better with each viewing. In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in its realistic portrayal that sometimes, crime DOES pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good DOES go unrewarded.\n\nThis film ushered in a new concept of a previously all too oft told Western story, probably tolling the death knell for the traditional American-made, Good guy/ Bad guy, White hat/ Black hat Western that was so prevalent before it.\n\nThe three main characters of the film are as powerful as Leone's brilliant vision of the Civil War era America, he used as their backdrop. Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad') is evil in the flesh. Beedy-eyed and totally ruthless, he believes it only takes one thing to be successful: whatever is necessary.\n\nClint Eastwood ('The Good') is the now legendary 'Man With No Name', but 'good' only in a Western concept of non-traditional good. He has a sometimes detectable and occasionally observable sense of honor that motivates his behavior and conduct from time to time.\n\nEli Wallach ('The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most colorful character in the film. Impulsive and full of barely suppressible rage, Tuco gyrates wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be a best friend in one scene, trying to kill in another. Tuco truly represents 'the ugly' side of human behavior.\n\nAt two hours and forty-one minutes, the movie was lengthy for its day, but there's neither a single scene that seems unnecessary, nor does the film seem lengthy while viewing it. The film unfolds with a charismatic style and grace, slowly revealing more and more about each character and the film's story. The pace of the film expertly captures the flavor of the time, giving the viewer a rare peek into a page of American history come alive on film.\n\nDirector Sergio Leone (who contributed to another epic of note: 'Ben-Hur' as an uncredited second unit director in 1959) manages to build a lot of sometimes unsettling tension in the film, thus preventing the longer than usual movie from ever getting uncomfortable or predictable. Every typical Western clich\u00e9 possibly imaginable is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special honorable mention is Ennio Morricone's original music score, which is about as masterful and complementary as it gets, culminating in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film. The music is so rich and powerful it easily stands on its own merits, and is one of the biggest selling original movie soundtracks to date. It is impossible to imagine the film without it.\n\n'Unforgiven' may well have been the sequel to 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', the story of what eventually happened to the 'Man With No Name', and won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and the nomination for Best Actor for Eastwood in 1992 (the film also was nominated in six other categories and won in three of those). Eastwood dedicated this movie to Sergio Leone who died 30 April 1989 in Rome, and who had believed in him early in his career.\n\nCall it 'Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il' or call it 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', but after seeing it you'll call this movie absolutely brilliant at MANY levels, including the one mentioned above by Kitchener.\n\nIt is a classic like no other, and is easily one of the best Westerns and films of its kind ever made."

There are no really \"good\" guys, despite the title. But they are so well drawn that we are intrigued by the clash of spirits. It is very much like reading the Iliad. When Achilles dons the armor, he is going after another hero and must defeat one he respects. Here, respect may be the wrong word, but viable adversaries have a kind of sense of immovable object and irresistible force. There is so much violence and so many confrontations, it works so well. It, of course, got us away from the horse opera, or even the white hat of John Wayne (not to diminish the joy of those films) and created an opening for the anti-hero. What a piece of cinema."

With Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach in leading roles, the trio's pursuit of the treasure takes them through a landscape filled with suspense, unexpected twists, and moments of reckoning.\n\nIn \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" the director skillfully weaves a narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, exploring themes of greed, loyalty, and the blurred lines between good and bad. The characters' individual stories converge to create a cinematic masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the Western genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is something amusing about the Italian fascination with the wild West, the absurd over-the-top score, the cheesy sound effects (at one point, one of the bandits sounds like he's walking across a marble floor in high heels), even the obsessive closeups of Eli Wallach's dentition. Less amusing is the relentless glorification of brutality and exaltation of greed--I can watch the NFL any time, I don't need a movie for that.\n\nThe campy fun of this movie is dampened by the knowledge that it has somehow been mistaken for a classic. All the characters are pretty equally repellent, unless you count Clint's gesture of giving his coat to a dying man 2 hours into the movie...in fact, this seems to be the only point where the movie even considers anything resembling humane values, and it's really not enough.\n\nAnd the title is mistranslated. In English, \"the X,\" where X is an adjective, doesn't refer to an individual who is X, it refers to a class of people, and is always plural. The movie should have been \"Good, Bad, and Ugly\" or \"The Good One, the Bad One, and the Ugly One.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "And Sergio Leone had to show Hollywood how a western should be done. Earthy, gritty, moody, rambling, funny and just plain nasty too. One thing most people forget about the Sergio Leone Dollar trilogy films is that they were made when westerns were really staid and boring, with zero atmosphere and very mechanical. Then came these movies, with THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY being the last and the greatest of the three Dollar films. Cinema wasn't the same after it was released. And to show influential this film is, it transcended its \"western\" genre and influenced practically every type of films made after that. Heck, I'm not even a western fan and I thoroughly admire what Leone and the gang created here. It's big, bold, melancholic, lusty, giddy and operatic.\n\nThe thing I really love about THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is the atmosphere. It's almost one kind. Never duplicated in any other film since (and that includes Clint Eastwood's dry cowboy flicks). One major contributing factor is obviously Ennio Morricone's unforgettable score, probably one of the greatest scores ever made. The music during the ending, when Tuco searches the cemetery, it's spine tinglingly powerful.\n\nOf the three characters, Tuco steals the show. He's the heart and soul of film. It's probably Eli Wallach's greatest performance. He immersed himself in the role and, in the processed, really became Tuco.\n\nMy only complaint about THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is that it is a low budget film and as expansive and epic as it is, the film sorta looks cheap. Practically everything was shot outside. There are few sets in the movie and when we are within four walls, the sets look, hmm, cheap. I just wished the production design was as expansive looking as the vision Leone had in mind. The film would have been perfect then. But that's something I can clearly overlook.\n\nWhen I watch a movie like THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, I get depressed. Depressed because at one time films were actually amazing, groundbreaking and entertaining. The 1960s were one of the greatest era in movie-making. Sadly today's films don't even come close to the stunning creative output of that decade. They should re-release THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY on the big screen. It's a classic film."

Usually, Spaghetti westerns annoy me do to the cheesy noises, unrealistic shooting, and lots of bore. But this movie was different. Unlike the other two, this movie had lots of simple comedy. (Most from Eli Wallach's silliness and stupidity as Tuco adds a perfect sense of comic relief and Clint Eastwood's slickness and intelligence as Blondie makes him so.... cool. Lee Van Cleef does a perfect job as the villain giving a sinister performance. Instead of the fact that the slow parts in the first two movies were boring, this movie took advantage of long shots for suspense and to get a sense of things which is a great directing tool. (Kudos to Sergio Leone) I can surely see why this is #4 on the IMDb top 250. It feels more realistic than the other two movies. No whistling noises when things fall, suspenseful music(and very famous), stellar acting, and nice shoot outs. One of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies and one of my favorite westerns ever! A+. 10/10 Watch this one right away. (I recommend watching the new edition DVDs, the white cases, because the quality is better, the sound is great, and newer, and the dubbing is near impossible to spot.) Don't miss this or you will miss one of the greatest, classic movies ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is rightly called a classic. Regardless of where you place it in your own list of the greatest films ever made, it will most likely be near the top. And that is what makes this such a classic \u2013 it is more than just a damn good Western. It is a damn good film.\n\nPlot \u2013 simple. There is some buried gold. Three lawless gunslingers are after it. They continue to run into each other and this gives the film momentum during the first two hours.\n\nSo much has already been written about this film that it is impossible to sum up all of its influences and innovations. The haunting whistles of the first moments of the title sequence are instantly recognisable even to those who have never seen a Western. Clint Eastwood is instantly recognisable in a career-making role. No matter your verdict, this is an immensely important film.\n\nDirector Sergio Leone has a sense for painful irony. 'The Good', Eastwood's character, begins the film by double crossing his partner (Eli Wallach's conflicted Tuco, 'The Ugly') and leaving him in the desert. This irony goes to the level of sight and sound. As 'The Bad' (Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes) tortures his victims at a Civil War P.O.W. camp, he orders the other prisoners to play their instruments to drown out the screams. The expressions on the faces of the musicians speaks volumes, and is more affecting to a modern audience than the scenes of torture themselves, gorged as we are on Saw and Hostel. It is this attention to storytelling detail in every frame of the film that makes it so rich and deep. How film-making has changed.\n\nWhile the film is long and slow, it has to be. The tension built up in the early parts of the film is punctuated by brief flashes of action, but it is the waiting before the action sequences that grabs you by the insides and slowly squeezes. There are ideas and emotions being played with in this film that cannot be quickly explained or unravelled, and these need the full three hours of the film to come to their conclusion. With the luxury of time, Leone is able to make a shared meal as tense and troubling as the moment, hands on guns, before a shootout.\n\nEven if you think the middle sections of the film dragged somewhat (philistine!) the finale is something special. In so many ways, it is the perfect climax to a film filled with moments of brilliance. There are too many parts to the film, too many special moments, to comment on any more, so I will simply say that this is a film I should have seen long before I did finally watch it. It is a film that, if you haven't seen, you should as soon as possible. And if you have seen it, a second, third or fifty-seventh viewing is in order. This film has quality that we are not given the privilege to see very often."

The film takes part of \u00a8the man without name\u00a8 trilogy united to \u00a8For a fistful dollars\u00a8, and \u00a8 A few dollars more\u00a8.\n\nThe movie centers about the ugly (Eli Wallach) , the bad (Lee Van Cleef) and the good (Clint Eastwood) in search for a Confederate treasure buried on a cemetery whose tracks have got the three enemies and is set during American Civil War.\n\nIt's too much violent but is neither tiring, nor boring, but entertaining. The film mingles noisy action , impressive battles, shootouts, violence with strong tortures, tongue in cheek, satire and a little bit of humor.\n\nThe final showdown between the three contenders is breathtaking.\n\nIn spite of the fact the runtime is overlong , nevertheless isn't dull . Direction by Sergio Leone is magnificent. Ennio Morricone musical score is extraordinary , the soundtrack has been imitated and copied by thousand occasions. Morricone's iconic theme music was designed in places to mimic the sound of a howling coyote . Production design by Carlo Simi and cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli is riveting . Shot in the deserts and landscapes of Spain : Burgos and Almeria , with 1,500 Spanish soldiers as extras .\n\nEli Wallach is very well , as he steals the show , he interprets a humorous and greedy murderous thief , Lee Van Cleef plays a villain and ominous killer and Clint Eastwood makes a dirty and wry 'man without name'.\n\nThis quintaessential 'Spaguetti' originated great influence of wide range in Western . It was such a good picture that had a great success. Followed by \u00a8 Once upon a time in West\u00a8and \u00a8Duck you sucker\u00a8.\n\nRating: very nice, above average 8'5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into this movie thinking the pacing would ruin the cinematic moments, but it makes the movie incredibly suspenseful.\n\nWe journey in the Civil War, with our 3 main protagonists that are shown near the beginning, and cross paths again at the end. The three separate stories really are well written with each others character getting their own spotlight without it seeming difficult to understand. The shots were very suspenseful usually have long shots or close-ups with a cool soundtrack. They give everyone such a charming and unique personality that builds off perfectly with the story.\n\nThis was my first Western movie, but I'm tempted to watch more because of how great everything was in this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Simply perfect in any way.\n\nThe film addresses the story of three people who intertwine with each other, although it seems clich\u00e9 Sergio Leone gives it in an unmatched way. The relationship that occurs between Blondie and Tuco is entirely natural, at no time is forced because one must be with the other, it is that humanism that there are between them two that is reflected throughout the trip, where with small actions It shows how well built the characters are, there is enough solidity in the lines and by God! Boy, no one demeans the characters, even the prostitute says consistent lines. The first scene of the bad is incredible, his great willingness to get what he wants is reasonable, he does not seek to dominate the world or defeat the good, only someone who has a goal in mind.\n\nThe re-enactment of the war of succession is avant-garde, it shows both leaders that there are no good or bad, only people who die for something that has no logic, we can see how those generals who are not in the history books saw the war as a suffering, a pain, a destiny to fulfill where the only thing there is death.\n\nThe film rejoices in the best photographs of the landscapes of Europe, the framing of the characters has the reason why it turns to the right, left, up or down, there is a reason and reason why go towards the character, because looking from afar, because take the horse's legs. The music is sublime, of the best songs in the history of cinema Ennio Morriconne is the only one who can compose for a confrontation in broad daylight and with Sergio Leone doing each take prolongs the sequence and still have that emotion about what will happen.\n\nThe edition as well as the art design do not remain relegated to the wardrobe, you can see the great quality and commitment that is in every detail.\n\nNot to mention the performances, Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef manage to withdraw from themselves, forget who they are, that there is a camera in front and they do it like no one else can, they make art with their performances, of course Tuco does Laughing, as it changes from solemnity to sarcasm in a few seconds is worthy of applause. Angel Eyes manages to make a very organic antagonist, he does not need to scream, kill everyone, he knows when to shoot and at no time does he feel pretended. Bolndie is such an endearing character, even if he is from the old west you manage to feel his fear, his thirst, his kindness and his solidarity, and boy did he have to work hard to hold a rifle with his hands and they didn't shake.\n\nI could talk more about the film, to notice how it influenced many directors such as Tarantino, Scorsese, DePalma, Kurbick, Spielberg, Lucas, Fincher, Nolan until the Russo but I will let you see it yourself and note that a dialogue with many is not necessary lines, a stellar and choral cast, great special effects and the best sound, you just need to have an idea, love and passion for your work, let yourself be overwhelmed by the creativity of a soundtrack and show that with little you can do a lot and that you cannot it is the \"what\" but the \"how\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was my first spaghetti western. Since I watch other films of the same genre. And is not bias because it was the first. This is just a great movie. It is the best western. Sergio Leone is a great director. He can make a scene really suspenseful and engaging with just silence and closes ups on the actors faces. He can make a characters face tell a story. The score by Ennio Morricone can elevate those scenes and moments to another level. His music and score is iconic and memorable. Leone and Morricone are fantastic and shouldn't be overlooked. The pacing is great. It doesn't slow down to much in this almost three hour film. Nothing dragged or felt out of place. The main trio of actors are amazing. Clint Eastwood as Blondie or The Man with No Name and his co star's Eli Wallach as Tuco and Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes respectful. Each actor was very unique in there roles. Wallach is a huge stand out. He plays this very dirty and ugly character with such energy and fun. Cleef is the perfect casting as the main antagonist. Eastwood is a stoic wanderer, he plays his character with a cool calm collective manner whilst being a smart badass gunslinger. The dialogue is great with many memorable lines. The characters are memorable and unique. The cinematography is very solid. The way some shots are framed is very creative. And the final is easily the most memorable and iconic western imagery in the western genres and film in general. The music elevates this moment so much. It's gripping and intense and will leave you satisfied. A great film everyone should watch!"

        "review_detailed_main": "First up for a spaghetti Western this doesn't appear anywhere near as hackneyed and half-arsed as the label might lead you to believe. In fact the blu-ray I rented looked pretty awesome.\n\nThe tale of the three titular desperados is long and elaborate. How long? How about 3 hours long. Long enough to have two on screen deaths and a full meal eaten before a line of dialogue is uttered.\n\nThe Good is Clint Eastwood, a rough n tough cowboy who plays as fair as you play him. He sports a perpetual three day growth and an equally permanent short cigar propped out of the corner of his thin lips.\n\nThe Bad is Lee Van Cleef, a dodgy soldier on the lookout for a man with one eye, for reasons that I will explain later.\n\nThe Ugly is the only guy with a name used regularly, Tuco (Eli Wallach). In fact Tuco is pretty much the star of the show, though Good n Bad get their moments.\n\nGood, Bad and Ugly are eventually all in pursuit of the same target, stolen gold coins, the whereabouts of which are only known to a one eyed soldier who sports a patch.\n\nThe greater part of the film plays like those riddles where the farmer must get the chook, the fox and the wheat from one shore to the other without something eating something else, only he can only fit one thing in his boat at a time. The Bad knows the location of the gold, the Good knows not the location but specifics once you get there, and the Ugly is the key to bringing all loose ends together.\n\nEach of the grimy trio spend ample time getting to know \u2013 and beat the shtuffing out of \u2013 each other. They take turns leaving each other for dead and at various times all seem to hold the upper hand, only to have it taken from them.\n\nThere are loads of close ups highlighting shifty eyes, many slow drawn out scenes including what must be the longest Mexican stand off on history, and I must say the makeup jobs were quite well done. As the film is set in the US civil war era some of the settings are surprisingly intricate and feature a cast of thousands of well costumed extra, further dispelling any notion that I had of a 'spaghetti Western' being a cheap knock-off, and though the length and long periods of inactivity were a little different to my modern day ADD sensibilities I was rarely bored, which in a three hour 45 year old film might be the strongest recommendation I can give.\n\nFinal Rating \u2013 7.5 / 10. I wish I could explain it better but the circular sounding whistle that forebodes every gun fight (and parody) know to film originated in this film. If you only watch once Western this year \u2013 or this decade \u2013 you could do a lot worse than this."

I came into the movie knowing it was long, but was told it was worth it. That statement caused me to waste 3 hours of my life. Anyway, on to the reasons why it was a waste. The movie itself had a decent storyline. The problem with this movie, however, was that it is the longest, drawn out movie known to mankind. This movie could have been played out in literally 20 minutes based on what all happened in the movie. Instead, viewers get to wait 30 minutes while it shows Clint Eastwood crawl 20 feet through the sand not saying a word. Against my better judgment, I continue watching, waiting for something spectacular to happen in the end. As the end approaches, viewers get to wait through yet another drawn out scene, of 3 men standing in a triangle pointing guns at each other. After, 10 minutes of watching that, I lost interest of who was going to die anyway. It literally switches cameras more times than I can count. Then, the finale comes. That is when I comprehend just how much time had been lost in this movie. I am writing this review as a friendly favor to warn you of this lame excuse of a movie, because no one was there to warn me."

The quintessential Trio of film including Eastwood's The Good, Lee Van Cleef's The Bad, and Eli Wallace's The Ugly make the film incredibly entertaining, tense, and Thrilling. The post world war 2 backdrop where people were still fighting even though the war had ended adds a very interesting component to the film. Two specific scenes are perfect, peak cinema, masterpieces. Those two scenes are the Tuco Graveyard scene and the famous stand-off scene. These scenes hit incredibly hard and give me chills every time. One last thing to bring up is the beautiful score by Ennio Morricone, the theme The Ecstasy of Gold is one of the greatest pieces of classical music ever. In conclusion this is the quintessential spaghetti western and a very well made film."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is one of the pinnacles of my experiences of a moviegoer. Not only is it my all-time favorite Western and therefore, one of my all-time favorite movies regardless of genre, but is a landmark in the history of cinema itself. First of all, it is proof that oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best ones. The plot is fairly simple: three men try to reach a buried fortune of Army gold coins while the Civil War erupts around them. The story is even simpler and yet the audience gets wrapped around in it as 160 minutes and those 160 minutes just seem to whip by so fast that when the movie does end, we're craving for more. The film is also evidence that the Western is not a dying genre, for this landmark film from Italian director Sergio Leone has aged like wine; time has done nothing to varnish its style and authority. And it is also proof that Spaghetti Westerns, which are low in budget and oftentimes flamboyant and over-the-top, can be art, too.\n\nThis was the third and final time that Clint Eastwood worked with Sergio Leone. He returns again as the mysterious Man with No Name: a cigar-chugging bounty hunter quick on the draw and minimal in emotions. Here is the pinnacle of the vintage Eastwood as an actor, where he could manufacture a character by doing little other than squinting and hissing some sparse dialogue. Eastwood's in prime form here. The movie also features Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, a mercenary/bounty hunter/Army colonel, the exact opposite of the warm-hearted character he played in the previous Western \"For a Few Dollars More.\" But oddly enough, even though Eastwood gets top billing, the central character is Tuco, played with outstanding charisma and sharp energy by Eli Wallach. Wallach had played bad guys and anti-heroes before, but here as the bumbling, deliberately comical, greedy, self-centered, and yet somehow likable and personable Tuco, he steals the show. The movie stays interesting as these three men change partnerships with each other, whenever it seems convenient and when it'll bring them closer to the 200,000 dollars in stolen coins. These three characters, wonderfully written and acted, are an important column holding this film's roof up.\n\nSergio Leone was very much the David Lean of Italy. He could set up beautiful landscape shots and cinematography tricks like few others could. That's part of the reason why so little can happen for so long and yet the tension mounts higher than most. The way he also contrasts long shots with close-ups and montages it all is sheer brilliance. His timing is also exquisite. He knows how long to go, when to cut, when to produce a long take, when to crop a short one, and so on and so forth.\n\nAnd I cannot leave out Ennio Morricone's music, which is even more famous than the movie itself. His main theme, which has been used in parodies and cultural references for more than forty years, is justifiably famous. But whereas it is usually used in parodies to produce a comical effect, here it fits the mood of the picture down to the bone. There's not a single weak cue of music in this marvelous soundtrack.\n\nBut what's most remarkable about this movie is that it sustains itself for the entirety of its 160-minute length and throughout most of it, very little happens. There are long stretches - minutes upon minutes - where virtually nothing happens. Oftentimes there isn't any music. It's not just the suspense of waiting for Leone's trademark bursts of action; the cinematography and the montage and the directing are so taut and winded together that the audience cannot even force themselves to look away. And if one seeks proof, they have to look no further than the film's climax. Of course because it's a Western, it will have an obligatory final showdown. But consider this showdown. We have three men facing each other down and it goes on for four minutes. Four minutes and the actors are hardly even moving. The only real movement is the camera, which is locked-down, but montaging amongst what is very nearly static images. Coupled with Ennio Morricone's heart-thumping music, this showdown, where very little happens for so long, comes across as one of the most electrifying climaxes in cinema history. Sure the music helps a lot, but it's the directing by Sergio Leone that really makes this scene so intense.\n\n\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is most definitely one of the most important films of all time and it certainly has earned its immortality in the realm of the cinema. It is undoubtedly the greatest Spaghetti Western of them all and Sergio Leone's masterpiece. The first film is this trilogy, \"A Fistful of Dollars\" was nothing more than an off-beat, but fun remake of \"Yojimbo.\" The second film was also entertaining and fun. But the third movie is a masterpiece. Even at a great length of 160 minutes, and having most of it consumed by silence and stillness, the film never falters to goes on for too long. It goes on and when it does at last end, the audience is left craving for more. They can satisfy themselves in two ways: a) seeking out Leone's director's cut, which is about twenty minutes longer and b) watching the movie again, something I have done and will continue to do many, many times."

        "review_detailed_main": "Civil War, gold is up for grabs, and three dirty cowboys all want it. Seems like a regular Western. It's a good thing film-directing God Sergio Leone and cowboy-extraordinaire Clint Eastwood paired up, because in that genre, there isn't a better match. To this day, there hasn't been a movie that comes close to the depth and craft that his movie produces.\n\nIt's a beautifully woven-together piece of cinema that Sergio knows what to do with. He creates a feeling of both intensity and humor by portraying the three key characters with one trait only; The Good (Clint Eastwood), The Bad (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly (Eli Wallach). These characters follow their own instincts, whether it be good or bad, and let nothing stand in their way of recovering the gold. The only problem is, they have to work together to get it. One knows the place of the gold (a graveyard), and one knows which grave it's buried under. Just how long does it take until the cowboys let their pride and betrayal ruin their treasure hunt? Though the beautiful directing is immensely distinct and original, the movie is very plot-driven. The characters don't matter to us. We could have The Good play The Ugly and it would still be the same outcome. But from Sergio's vision, comes a truly magnificent submission into the psychology of the Civil War civilians and determined, gun-shooting varmints.\n\nAt first, we meet the characters by obviously seeing them do what they're intended to do. The Ugly robs a store, The Bad kills a few people, and The Good saves someone's life. After that, we see that The Ugly and The Good are actually working together to do what dirty cowboys do best; collect their money. Upon finding out about the treasure, all three characters become The Determined, and both work together and hang each other by the necks (literally) to find the gold.\n\nFrom beginning to end, \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\" is utterly entertaining and unique. It can be called both a Western and a War movie. As the plot develops and thickens, we see more of the setting than in all other Westerns combined. Everything is twice as big, and everything is twice as dirty. A definite classic, that defined cinema in more than one way, with its memorable score, to the never before seen directing, the movie stands as one of (if not the) best movies of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just want to make a quick few comments here. I know this film is highly rated and people love it. And yeah, I found it enjoyable. I like a good shooter film with Clint Eastwood. But it seemed flawed and people are quick to forgive here where they don't elsewhere.\n\nThe historical accuracy of the film is the biggest problem, with guns that are incorrect for the period, and the really strange suggestion that the North fought the South in this region... which, really, just didn't happen. I liked the drunk military man, but it wasn't realistic.\n\nThe dubbing was annoying. Clint Eastwood speaks English and he speaks to a variety of characters who are speaking Italian. Okay, one or the other. Hire actors who speak English or get Italians and subtitle the film. It's awkward to have Eastwood talking to people who, on the set, who probably didn't understand.\n\nLastly, I need more Lee VanCleef. If he's \"the bad\", he should have a bigger role. Instead you have mostly Eastwood, who is \"the good\", being just as bad as the villain. I respect the idea that good and evil are not clear-cut, but why do I side with Eastwood if he's no more good than VanCleef? That being said, the film had a lot going for it. Very fun shooter, great bridge explosion scene (possibly better than \"River Kwai\") and the very memorable theme song. As far as Westerns go, I don't know that it was really much more advanced than \"Stagecoach\". Maybe more epic and longer, and Eastood can out-act John Wayne any day, but there wasn't much new here.\n\nI recommend this and feel I need to see it again, but perhaps see \"For a Few Dollars More\" first... that will give you some VanCleef action and Klaus Kinski."

        "review_detailed_main": "I won't say this is the most overrated movie ever made. There are many movies which are considered among the best ever by the majority of people that are as overrated as this one is. However, that this is one of the most overrated of all time, no one can deny that.\n\nI hate westerns. However, considering the fame of this one, the fact that it is in most lists of the all time's greatest movies, the fact of being a Spanish-Italian production and the value that most people give it (including this guy who is a friend of mine, who owns the movie and loaned it to me), I decided to give it a look, even though its long runtime could easily scare me off.\n\nI know that its Italian title is 'Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo', but I don't know if it was filmed in English language and later dubbed in Italian or the contrary, although I believe it was filmed in English.\n\nThis spaghetti western was directed by Sergio Leone and stars Clint Eastwood as Blondie (\"The Good\"), Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (\"The Bad\") and Eli Wallach as Tuco (\"The Ugly\").\n\nTo be frank, the character Tuco annoyed me very much, not to mention that he was worst than snakes. Angel Eyes was nowhere near as annoying, being a more likable character in comparison. Blondie is a more complicated character. He's supposed to be the good guy yet he teams with Tuco during most of the movie and actually saves him twice from his execution rope (including in the end, when he was supposed to kill him). He kills Angel Eyes, yet he doesn't kill Tuco - and after everything that Tuco did to him. He is not that good after all...\n\nThere's some good in this movie but I saw far more of bad and ugly in it. There is brutal violence in this. Plus, the movie is way too long. And it doesn't really offer much during its runtime of nearly 3 hours.\n\nCertain sequences were filmed in a way that strongly resembles me '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The first 9-10 minutes are a good example of this. The opening is long and has music, there is no dialog, the slow pace of the scenes gives us time to appreciate the scenario. Another good example of this is the Mexican standoff scene that lasts 5 minutes near the ending when the 3 main characters stare each other down in the graveyard's circular center, calculating alliances and dangers (and the amazing distance which the camera films it).\n\nThe famous film score by Ennio Morricone (who is a genius, like John Williams) is phenomenal, especially the spectacular and unforgettable main theme. But the music that plays when Tuco is running in the Sad Hill cemetery is equally memorable.\n\nI didn't know that this movie was part of a trilogy, much less that it was the 3rd one. I also thought it was from the 50's, not the 60's. Anyway, none of that matters. This movie didn't do anything for me. Is this one of the all time's greatest movies? Absolutely not!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Before watching this movie, I have seen A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars more and I was quite impressed with both. However, after I have seen this, Leone instantly became one of my favorite directors. Leone has a distinct style in his films and this movie pulls it out 150%.\n\nThe cinematography in this film is incredible. His use of extreme long shots and extreme close ups are unsurpassed. The film opens with the close up of a man with an expressionless face creating a sense of mystery and excitement. What will this guy going to do? What's going to happen? Then we are introduced to two new unknown men and the three walk towards the entrance. Silence. Then suddenly, the 3 bust in, guns are shot and Tuco busts through the window and escapes with a half eaten chicken (or pork) leg. One of the men is injured, tries to make a futile final attempt to kill him and falls to the floor; the other 2 are already dead. Just in that one scene, we are introduced to Tuco and can already guess his character, his background info, and skill... without a single spoken line of dialogue.\n\nAs a matter of fact, nobody speaks until about 10 minutes into the film. It is all visual. We, the audience, are forced to imagine what the characters are thinking, what might be taking place. Leone gives the viewers a chance to guess what might happen. Even in Once Upon a Time in the West, we see his mastery at the No-Dialogue introduction. I also believe that this is his way to introduce the character's personality traits without the viewers actually knowing that they know it. A subtle technique so when they see a character do something later in the movie, the viewers can accept the character's actions.\n\nHowever, Leone would not be as great as he is if it wasn't for his partner Ennio Morricone and his unique and memorable soundtrack. The coyote-like music sets the mood for this film like no other western. It is something you must listen to and experience it to retain the full appreciation of it, and know why it has become the trademark music for the western genre.\n\nThese techniques go on throughout the film and bring us to the ultimate scene in film history, where Leone's style shines to it's full extent. His incredible use of long shots to set the stage, close ups to catch the expressions, music to set the mood, montage to create the tension, expand it and finally when you are at the edge of you're seat, the scene goes off like lighting in the incredible climatic ending.\n\nLeone is not just any director. He is one of the best, and THIS is his western!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not an expert nor do I want to sound like one, but I think this is one of the most famous western films ever made, despite being shot by an Italian director and being more European than American. S\u00e9rgio Leone was one of the most notable directors of his time and he left us, in this film, one of his masterpieces.\n\nThis is one of those movies that is almost perfect. Problems and failures are scarce and reside in minimal details that end up not making a big difference in the overall work. The story was very well written and takes place in the midst of the American Civil War, a time when violence was part of everyday life. In this environment of violence and mutual distrust, two men are looking for a treasure buried in a cemetery: the problem is the fact that each one knows only part of the location (that is, one knows the location of the cemetery and the other knows which grave it is) and there is a third man, a fearsome assassin, willing to do anything to take all the gold.\n\nFor this film, Leone put together a very reasonable cast, mostly European, and three great North American actors with enormous talent: Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. I believe that they knew how to make the most intelligent and skilful use of this film, giving us a truly remarkable job. For this three actors, this is the best cinematographic work of their career, or one of the best, consecrating them as great Western movies actors. The film, however, seems to give Wallach more and better opportunities. While watching it, I got the feeling that he is the actor who receives most attention and best material, in addition to having known how to improvise at the right moments and in creative and intelligent ways.\n\nThe film has great visual beauty, emphasized by the cinematography, the filming work and the good choice and design of sets and costumes. At a time when the correct period recreation was something that cinema sometimes blatantly ignored, this film did the opposite, giving us a realistic and believable vision of the past and placing the film in a specific place and time. I'm not saying it was a one hundred percent successful effort, but it was definitely a decisive step in the right direction when it comes to period films. The special effects and visuals are excellent, the best there was then, and the whole film has an epic, grandiose, expensive feel. It is also very long, with almost three hours in length, but it is worth not being afraid or giving up on because of that. Being a Western film, it is quite evident that there is a lot of violence, so it is not a film for children. Even so, it is not gratuitous violence. Finally, we owe Ennio Morricone a salute for the excellent soundtrack he composed. Among his vast work, this is not my favorite nor the best, but it is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and iconic pieces, a work that we know, even without having seen this film, and that has become part of our collective memory. We can't ask for more than that."

The haunting melodies and evocative use of instruments create a sense of tension, excitement, and melancholy that perfectly complements the film's narrative.\n\nBeyond its technical brilliance, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" explores themes of greed, morality, and the human condition. It delves into the dark and complex nature of its characters, presenting a nuanced and thought-provoking examination of the choices they make in pursuit of their goals.\n\n\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is an epic Western that has stood the test of time.

Many have included this in their all-time top 10 films and again it comes as no surprise. With those I agree, this is a great film. There is little I can add that hasn't been said here but I will go back to the beginning. I was a Clint Eastwood fan when I was a kid from his role as Rowdy Yates in Rawhide. When he made the Spaghetti Westerns as they were called, I of course had to see him on the big screen. A Fistfull of Dollars and A Few Dollars More were unlike the typical Hollywood Westerns of the 50's and 60's. Italian and American actors in low budget productions with overdubbed dialog filmed in Spain which was supposed to be Mexico or the US Soutwest. Heavy on style with strange music. Raw realism emerged from this strange brew and I loved them. Then this came out. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Just the title itself was so impressive you knew this was going to go to another level from the first two. And it did. Ennio Morricone's music was so different and wonderfully strange and remains so even today. It was the perfect soundtrack score for this film. Sergio Leone's direction and his story and screenplay along with Luciano Vincenzoni and cinematography by Tonio Delli Colli are superb. A great cast with Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood's Hang Em High and High Plains Drifter that would follow were good but they couldn't top this. I've seen this dozens of times on TV but I haven't seen it on the big screen since it's initial release. This film ran a little long but it didn't matter because this was clearly a masterpiece. And so it remains. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it. I'd love to see it on the big screen again."

There are some other Camera Tricks here that are playfully fresh (for 1966) and it was without doubt, Psychedelia before it was fashionable......The Soundtrack that is now an indelible part of Pop Culture and reminds us Today of how different it really was.\n\nThe Bad......Endless Closeups of squinting eyes. A tendency to elaborate on already elongated Scenes to add to the already established Suspense......The Character Tuco becomes relentlessly obnoxious, overbearing, irritating, and unlikeable immediately and this keeps up for almost 3 Hours. It is an overacted Performance that makes the Movie less engaging......The length seems padded and indulgent.\n\nThe Ugly......All the Characters, their Personalities and the Makeup. This is truly a Panorama of Ugliness throughout and given its length, a bit too much to bare......There is for your viewing pleasure...flies, filthy Faces (almost always in close up) chewing little cigars and sporting blood, pus, scabs, and other assorted flavors like food being shoveled into salivating mouths with Technicolor glee......Ugly could be a word that would describe this Movie. Another would be overrated.\n\nIn conclusion......The best Spaghetti Western is from the same Director...Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I was a kid, nobody liked westerns. Our fathers had fought in the Korean War, and the astronauts were racing in space. Cowboys seemed old, dusty, and boring. Then along came three guys to change all that. One was good, the other bad, the other ugly. Or maybe they all had those three characteristics in them. But they arrived at one hell of a showdown, and it changed things.\n\nThis is not just an action filled western, but a sweeping commentary on the American character, as witnessed by an objective outsider. His aim was true.\n\nBy the mid 60s, the western formula, and perhaps the action film itself, had become too stale and conventional to evoke any enthusiastic response. Leone gave us not just a new perspective on film violence, but for the first time a director blended the most fascinating elements of American history, both mythical and real, into a traditional western story.\n\nThe storyline, involving three untitled men propelled by avarice into uncivilized territory, could serve as a fable for the expansion of the American frontier. Against the sun-blasted background we see the elements that have shaped, in different ways, the essential American character: warfare, technology, weapons, hardened individualism. Previous western films might have explored related themes, but never with the exciting visual style shown in this one.\n\nThe characters are men we really have never seen before. They are enigmatic, inscrutable, and fascinating to look at. Leone leaves their pasts unmarked so we can eagerly fill in their backgrounds on our own. As their journey in pursuit of lucre ends, we are presented with the best showdown in the history of the western. The quest, exciting as it was, culminates in one of the best endings in movie history.\n\nThe score of course is famous in itself but welded to the fascinating visuals and characters it becomes one for the ages. Amazing it took an Italian director filming in Spain to make the essential \"American\" western film. You don't like westerns? I urge you to try this and see things from an outsider's point of view. His aim was true."

Only a handful come to my mind, and it's a very small handful at that.\n\nSergio Leone's classic western provides the perfect ensemble of cinematography, direction, acting, story, and last, but not least, music. Leone's film about three greedy men in the search for 500,000 in gold exemplifies the dirty west. This is not your typical American western, where the sun-drenched west is romanticized. No, it's dirty and rough, just like the west was. If anyone wanted to watch the film that is the antithesis the \"chick-flick,\" I would recommend The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\n\nClint Eastwood reprises his iconic Man With No Name in this final film in the Dollars Trilogy. Lee Van Cleef returns from A Few Dollars More; however, he plays a different (much different) character. The actor who steals the show has to be Eli Wallach. Wallach, a western veteran, plays Tuco with great viciousness and humor, making him likable and unlikeable at the same time; he truly is \"ugly.\" Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli pack the film with great shots of the west, from the tired sands of the desert, to the endless graves of a cemetery (which was actually located in Spain). Ennio Morricone combines Colli's lush cinematography with the greatest score ever put onto film. From the easily recognizable theme, to the sad Story of a Soldier, to the excitement of Ecstacy of Gold, this soundtrack has it all.\n\nWhat more can I say? If you haven't seen The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, see it now! I can not press you more. This is one of those films that could be considered perfect, or the closest to perfection. A classic that shall never be forgotten; a classic that shall always be admired."

It represents the birth, or at least one of the births, of the anti-hero in Hollywood. There are not many films where the word classic applies more than this one.\n\nSergio Leone's direction here is just perfect. No man understood the Western genre more than he did. The movie is a perfect combination of fun, serious, and thrilling. It is perfectly written and perfectly acted. The real story here however, as most people know, is the score by Ennio Morricone. This man defined the theme of the Western Genre. No filmmaker/composer would ever be able to create a Western that did not sound like Ennio Morricone's theme. It is just perfect. Clint Eastwood does an incredible job as you expect, but it is the performance by Eli Wallach that steals the show for me.\n\nI avoided spoilers in this review because I want to try and attract a younger audience to films like these. Almost every film fan has heard of and most likely seen this movie, but there is a definite reluctance from the younger generation to watch older films. This makes sense given the popular films in the modern day, but it makes no sense if you have ever watched this film. If you are reluctant to watch older movies, this is a perfect place to start. It may open a world that you never knew existed."

I'm going to make each one of my kids watch it when they get to be like 10 years old. It's a film that absolutely captures the essence of what life is all about. There really are only three types of people out there, and the three characters in this film are complete, yet simple, portraits of those three types.\n\nThe hairs on my arms stand up every time I watch this film, especially during the final scene. Sergio Leone knows how to build a scene. Ennio Morricone's music is absolutely perfect with this film. It's hard to think of a movie with a better soundtrack actually.\n\nTo summarize: brilliant, breathtaking, mesmerizing...and like a fine wine, this one just gets better and better. So far ahead of it's time, it blows your mind. \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is one of the greatest movies ever made.\n\n10 out of 10, kids."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is not just the best western ever made, it is at least in the top 5 movies of all time. Why? Well, where to start...\n\n...the story\n\nThis movie has a simple plot: Three guys searching for 200.000 dollars. But what's wring about a simple story? Right, absolutely NOTHING. Especially if it's so good working like in this film. All three characters have unique trait marks that play a big role during the 2 hours 50. And lets talk about this rather long running time. You won't feel the lenght at all! There is not a single moment I felt bored and the pacing is very slow. And because of that slow pacing the finale is even more satisfying.\n\nOne of the most tenseful moments of cinema history: The Showdown. And that leds me to...\n\n...the music\n\nEnnio Morricone. One name. More shouldn't I have to say. The man, the legend, master of his profession. Just the music during The Showdown is enough to say that without his music the movie would be easily one point lower rated. There is little music that everybody can identify easier with a whole genre than his. But he is just the first of the three legends that created this movie's legacy. Lets focus on...\n\n...the directing\n\nSergio Leone. Without this guy the western genre would just consist of John Waynes movies and a few unknown. The genre would not have become this important as it was. The unique style of his directing build a whole new subgenre: The italo-western. When watching his movies you know that he made them, the emotions of the characters are depicted in a way never seen before. Just look at the showdown scene. It's brilliant. But of course this is only possible because of the third person that defined the movie. Let's talk about....\n\n...the acting\n\nClint Eastwood. Is there anybody who don't know this man? His unique performave as the man without a name during all three movies of the dollar trilogy is a masterpiece of it's own. When I think about a cowboy the image of Clint Eastwood is in front of my eyes. This guy defined the genre like no other (even John Wayne) and is one of the best actors Hollywood has ever seen. This guy is a phenomenon!\n\nSo let's summarize that, you have a powerful story with one of the greatest finales of all time, the trio of perfection giving you masterclass music, directing and acting and 2 hours and 50 minutes full of entertaining.\n\nIt's hard to beat that, it may even impossible to top that. I rarely give a ten out of ten, because that means perfection, but this movie is perfection so there is no other choice.\n\nGo watch it, everybody should do it, because if you die without watching it, you missed something big, very big you missed\n\nIl Masterpiece."

Seems most people should learn how to watch a movie, then maybe write a review (I d suggest Talking Pictures: How to Watch Movies)\n\nAlright, let's put into context the fact this movie was released in 1966 and the production is indeed epic.\n\nFrom the number of extras and all the locations and the set design (especially the ending scene at the cemetery which was completely built from scratch).\n\nAnd yes: the score by Morricone is magnificent and became an instant classic.\n\nAnd yes: the editing was revolutionary with the fast cuts between establishing shots and extreme close ups .\n\nAnd Yes: the classic western genre of white hat / black hat is indeed represented differently (the \"good\" is just good looking, he is as bad as the others)\n\nThat said: the 3 story act structure wasnt really a thing back then and it shows. I do not care about any of the characters. At all. A bit better with the \"ugly\" since he has a bit of a backstory and shows more humanity and facial expressions than the others.\n\nPlus: the dubbing is horrendous sometimes; the whole thing is unnecessary long (especially the first hour or so which should be the end of the first act); too many deus ex machina moments move the movie forward which is utterly lame; certain events are just simply unrealistic or illogical (gun in the bathtub ready to fire... come on)"

Of course, no discussion of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" would be complete without mentioning Ennio Morricone's iconic score.

        "review_detailed_main": "People like to throw the term 'Masterpiece' around and rarely is it ever as apt and as TRUE when concerning Sergio Leone's The Good the Bad and The Ugly.\n\nI mean, where to start? How about the music for instance, Morricone writes truly inspirational and masterful work, sure, everyone knows the theme tune, but his music has influenced EVERY western reference since. He captures the mood, the emotion and makes this movie EPIC with his wonderfully orchestrated scores. The landscapes and scenery are visually stunning and it's perfectly filmed for true atmosphere, intertwining with the aforementioned music, well it's nothing short of magnificent. Every scene is influential and significant, and equally as intriguing. The acting by Clint Eastwood can take no other meaning but 'cool'. He is what every gun-slinging', cigarette chewing cowboy is based on post-this and no doubt has inspired TONS of action heroes (Or indeed Villains) throughout cinema.\n\nBut the storyline isn't as basic as one would first imagine: three gunmen searching for a rather large sum of money, it seems that simple. However, all of the gunmen have complex personalities and none are flawless in moral judgment, to which it is hard to judge who is indeed 'Good', 'Bad' or 'Ugly'. The classic 'Good Versus Evil' situation that is such a frequent theme in film (And coincidentally, more often in westerns) is slightly blurred in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and I personally think there is no definite and it is left up to the viewer to decide.\n\nThis movie is simply essential viewing, an all-time classic and much deeper than would first appear. Incredible."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really couldn't understand most of the reviews here that place this film as a great western or even the best ever for some fans. In my opinion this is just a watchable and good western, but not much more than that.\n\nI think the only possible explanation would be that IMDb reviewers consider \"spaghetti\" westerns a sub-genre within the western genre. If that is so, \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" would probably stand among the best (if not the best)in the \"spaghetti\" westerns ranking. But the point is that in my opinion there are no sub-genres within the western genre. So I analyze this film just for what it is: a western film.\n\nIn such terms, this film has its moments, fine open-wide outdoor locations, good action gunfights (though hardly believable) and an acceptable plot. Good acting too mainly in Eli Wallach's Tuco.\n\nBut what really demerits this movie is its incredibly unnecessary overrun; there's no way the story can stand almost 3 hours in duration and so the development is definitely slow. Overruning has always been a characteristic of director Sergio Leone; he sort of engages madly with some sequences and he goes on and on and on at it (the final duel here is an example with all those unnecessary close shots in the men's faces and eyes). Another clear sample of what I'm saying was the incredibly long -and even boring- opening sequence of \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", where Leone takes more than 10 minutes in the opening sequence where three gunmen are waiting for Charles Bronson at a train station.\n\nCome on guys, let's face it. \"Spaghetti\" westerns are \"B\" movies and even if at the very start they could have seemed sort of original and somehow enjoyable, once you take an honest critical look at them they're not great films but just good a few of them but no more than that. Sorry again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been a Clint Eastwood fan for years. But I have NEVER watched his Westerns. That's kind of idiotic isn't it?? Well suddenly I'm having an Eastwood movement and sinking myself into Westerns for the first time in my life and it only made sense that I start with what some critics and fans call \"The Greatest Western ever made.\" In some respects I agree with that because it embodies everything that the Western is...even if you have never seen a Western you know the way they are supposed to go and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly encompasses every aspect of the stereotypical Western. Also a film like this has to be judged by it's release time as well and for 1966, this film's violent and gritty story would have made heads explode and Eastwood's trademark Man with No Name made Eastwood the gosh darned coolest, slickest man in history. The story explodes into an epic 3 + hour (extended cut) film about three man of completely different personalities, backgrounds, and goals trying to find a hidden treasure by a Civil War soldier and stay alive while basically beating the living daylights out of each other. The film is gritty, bleak, and the three main characters are so watchable that each one could carry their own film.\n\nClint Eastwood...how can you possibly say that name and then try to critique the man's acting. If you looked up the definition of masculine in the dictionary...there his picture would be...probably from this film. Eastwood's raspy voice, his \"doesn't take any crap\" attitude, and completely violent personality (in his characters of course) makes him the best gun fighter in ANY Western. He is the perfect leading man especially for a Western and he had to be THE GOOD in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Eastwood is Eastwood and that is the highest compliment you can give. Lee Van Cleef embodies THE BAD, I mean the man has being a villain down to a science and although he doesn't share a whole lot of screen time with the stars he has his own brand of justice that makes him the perfect villain. In a lot of ways he is the polar opposite of Eastwood. He still has the raspy voice, and the cool demeanor and he has this killer instinct that makes him petrifying to see on screen. But all in all he doesn't get the majority of the story and there is a lot of back story to his character left unexplored. I would have loved to see a sequel or another story where he plays Angel Eyes because it would have great to see him back on screen in this role. And finally I save the best for last. I have found a new absolute favorite screen character in Tuco played by veteran actor Eli Wallach. Tuco is THE UGLY in every way shape and form. His drunken, sarcastic, and annoying personality makes him the real stand out performance in this film. In fact he seems to get the majority of the lines and the screen time as we watch his journey to try and get rich. And on top of that the tumultuous relationship between his off again, on again partner Eastwood's \"Blondie\" as named by Tuco. The two of them start as partners until Eastwood turns on him and leaves him which only makes Tuco seek revenge in a horrible way, one of the great scenes where Tuco forces Eastwood across the desert nearly killing him in the process. But you know that can only mean Eastwood will get the last word and he does. Tuco is amazing. He's hilarious, he's bumbling, but he has fantastic good luck when it comes to getting away and on top of it all despite his humorous character he's not easy to kill or a push over. He's blood thirsty, crafty and skilled as a gun man and a villain. The whole film must be watched for Wallach's Tuco alone.\n\nThis is my first taste but not my last of Eastwood Westerns and Sergio Leone who apparently is the be all and end all of Action western directors. I have the first two installments of the Man With No Name trilogy fired up in the VCR and ready to go. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in many ways is not outstanding and yet it has this mysterious quality that just sucks you in and makes it an absolute classic. From the dusty streets of the Western town amidst the brooding Civil War and the front, this film encompasses everything. And you can't mention the film without pointing out that haunting Western theme which almost seems like it's used comically but perhaps that's because it has been used as such in the future. You can't ever start a love for Westerns without seeing this...I have no doubt. And it will permanently go down in my books as one of my favorite Westerns. I will say it didn't need to be as long as it was and perhaps more of a climatic ending would have been nice but it's a classic and you can barely pick it apart. Made on a million bucks and probably 100 times that made back. Just see it!! 8.5/10"

Try to watch the movie knowing it was made 55 years ago, overlook the perfect shots and some funny expressions of the characters, the story is very good, it takes place during the American Civil War, a dying soldier buries 200 thousand dollars in gold and three men will go after this treasure, with the whole war scene in the background.\n\nThe soundtrack of this movie can be considered without a doubt one of the best three in the entire history of cinema, and it alone is worth the movie. Who has never seen a Metallica concert opening with \"Ecstasy of Gold\". So it is... In addition, great performances by a young Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef, added to a majestic direction by Sergio Leone.\n\nWithout a doubt, a 10/10 movie, one of the best of my entire life, even though I was already saturated."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think it can be better. The story is meant to be unfolded with 3 protagonists, but actually only two are the actual heroes (antiheroes). I don't really see the correspondence between the Bad and the other two, which made it quite confusing when I was expecting three persons' story intertwined. The Bad is quite static and two dimensional. Tuco is a successful character though. I see his personality fully elaborated and almost all of his behaviors are explained with his history. The best part is when he met his priest brother and said something like \"from where we were born, the only ways to survive are either to be a priest or a bandit.\" It is like a response to Stendhal's The Red and The black where the situation is either to be a priest or an aristocrat. The time sets in civil war America, where aristocracy life is out of the picture. That plot alone evolved Tuco from a dumb gangster to a complex and somewhat lovely character who we can sympathize. While the Good, although better depicted than the Bad, is not very successful neither. The storyteller apparently wanted to make his line a crucial thread, but we still don't know why he is the good one. He is not any better than Tuco, because they all kill people for a living. Sometimes he cares for others but that's not enough to turn our perspective on him from bad to good. Yup, he is attractive, but still - not enough. None of his history is told, so we don't have any evidence to understand his conducts as a whole. It's a pretty nice western though, but I do think there can be more. It can be so much better."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Where to begin reviewing this movie?. This is one of those movies that you can speak for days and not be over with all the many good things it did, is almost crazy to belive that this movie was panned by critics at the time, probably a response to a product of it\u00b4s time but from another country, we should agree. However critics where proved wrong with this movie and had to appreciate a Western that in many ways was more revolutionary and arguably better than anything produced in Hollywood.\n\nSergio Leone Direction for this movie is iconic and now one of the things that distinguish this type of movies, with beautiful and slow cinematographic long shots, extreme close ups, the storytelling he used and how graphich it was visually (At the time), but most iportant the build of tention he did in so many scenes, when you know something gonna happen but you have no idea when would happen, but when does happen it marks the movie and your life.\n\nThe acting in this movie is very underaprecciated in general, the main Trio has so much presence by them selves that they stole every inch of screen they are in, Ellie Wallach as Tuco is funny yet ragging, charismatic and just enbodies \"The Ugly\" as a word better than anyone has done; Lee Van Cleef as Sentenza \"Angel Eyes\" is so menacing, there\u00b4s no scene including him that make you think contrary, his incarnation of \"the Bad\" is just that, someone that appears to have no soul and would kill twisting his own rules at bennefit; and finally Clint Eastwood as Blondie, \"the Good\" that isn\u00b4t exactly good, a bounty hunter that has dubious moral codes, he is so unpredictable in what he is gonna do and how he is gonna do it, yet has some good in him and is the smartest of the trio, not to say the better gunslinger (in all movies arguably). The rest of the supporting cast does a good job at it, never outmatching the main charachters but doing really good carachterization and making the film have more weight, the shop owner, the soldiers, the Generals, the killers, all of them have a poruse on the film and add something special to the film.\n\nThe Score is another big one of this film, Ennio Morricone is a genius mind and there\u00b4s no better man to writte music for this genre of film than him, he easly outmatches most composers of Western movies and composers in movies in general. His score really put you in the mood of the scene, in how you are supossed to feel the film, in how raw the life was back then, the Main theme, Eacstsy of Gold, The Trio, the Sundown are great pieces of music, that\u00b4s how movie themes should work and how they have to make you feel.\n\nThis movie really broke the rules of typical film making as well, is one of those movies that don\u00b4t really care that much about the plot, wich in any other movie would feel wrong, but this one makes their scenes so heavy and so much happens on screen at the same moment that the plot becomes almost a non factor for the film, is a movie about circumstances that happen to their carachters and how they deal with them in that exact moments not really caring when it would get to the end of the plot, is much more about their stories and what they leave behind, however there is a plot but the film don\u00b4t rushes into it, it takes it\u00b4s time to get there and is so satisfying.\n\nWe already talked about the acting, but it\u00b4s worth talking about how this movie was one that popularized double sided charachters, specailly with Tuco and Blondie, it really don\u00b4t let you make up your mind about what you feel about them, the only thing you know is that they might be bad or good any moments, specailly that of the Man with no name, altough Wallach\u00b4s acting stole the show, Eastwood is one fo those presence actors that just need to put a cigar in his mouth and he will change movies forever and his charachter in this movie, cold, smart, few words spoken, and overall bad ass really changued movies to this very day, there\u00b4s so many movies that stole that concept and implemented into their own, not only in westerns but in action movies and Sci-Fi, there would not be Han Solos, Snake Pilskims or even Indiana Jones withouth the grandad of dirty players wich was Blondie.\n\nThere\u00b4s too much to talk about this movie again and most of all is positive to excelent, so whenever you have the chance go and Watch it, is the final instalment of the Dollars Trio or the Man with no name trilogy, yo surely won\u00b4t be dissapointed."

Plus the musical score and cinematography are excellent. Who would of thought that a \"spaghetti western\" would become such an honoured classic movie masterpiece? Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef all play characters that are right out of a Greek tragedy who represent different aspects of society. Watch, enjoy, and don't take the movie too seriously, that's how I believe the director wanted the audience to watch it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm glad I finally got down to seeing this film, I think everyone have heard about it, and everyone have definitely heard it's iconic theme music. The movie is three hour long (each move seem to increase with one hour) but that just makes it a movie with three hours of pure genius Western entertainment. Clint Eastwood as Blondie or \"the man with no name\" is as brilliant and bad-ass as ever, and even earn the title as \"the good\". lee Van Cleef returns with a new role (not the same role as in \"for a few dollars more\" as the well named \"the bad\" or \"angel eyes\". And Eli Wallach as Tuco \"the ugly\" a more humorous addition to the series, but also earn the title as he is neither good, nor bad. Greedy and a coward is a better description.\n\nOnce again it's all about money, this time 200 000 dollars, a lot of money back then. I won't spoil much, the money is buried in a grave, and only Tuco knows which cemetery, and only Blondie knows which grave. And \"Angel eyes\" are never far behind them.\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece of it's time, the acting is great, Sergio Leone deserves a lot of credit for this film, and the theme music is unforgettable. Plus they finally improved the dubbing which was a little unsynced in the two previous films. Also it portrayed a very realistic image of the American Civil War without taking any particular side in the conflict. then again the main character doesn't exactly care much for the war, they're just after the gold. Then still it's nice to see Blondie show his sympathy for those who fought and died in the war.\n\nI really can't recommend this film enough, if you haven't seen any of the films in this trilogy, buy them immediately and watch all of them. If you have the films and have only seen the two first, well what are you waiting for! Don't do anything other than buy this film, it's a must see and must have film. I give this film (obviously) a 10/10."

At certain parts the lips don't sync with the words that the character is saying which I found really annoying. The movie's strongest qualities are definitely the score and the cinematography, they're both phenomenal. The last scene was amazing but unfortunately the rest of the movie dragged on too much. Solid 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Watch films and TV shows to this day and you'll see how deeply influential that \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\" has been. Sergio Leone's masterpiece, to be sure. Just as influential, is the musical score by Ennio Morricone. Yet it's so interesting to note how Leone's style was greatly influenced by the work of John Ford.\n\nGBU is an essential film, and anyone reading this understands it. How many people, who don't like westerns, recognize that high-pitched wail that plays at the beginning and very end of the film? It's amazing that the film is 161 minutes long in its original theatrical release, but so many people are so satisfied with it from beginning to end.\n\nMost people generally root for that scoundrel, Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez - known as the rat! What I enjoyed was that Blondie was never *too* Good, while Angel Eyes was so good at being oh, so bad. Tuco, being the Ugly? You understand why he resorted to his ways as his character developed, and you tend to actually root for him. But you still never want to turn your back on him.\n\nOne of my favorite intimate scenes was Blondie, taking a pause from a pursuit, crossing paths with the soldier. Not one word is said, but the moment between them is truly touching. The only person we truly don't get too close to, is Angel Eyes, but you simply don't feel cheated by that.\n\nThe cinematography is exquisite. Whether it was the DP, Tonino Delli Colli, or the vision of Sergio's direction, you find a depth to the film like never seen before. The deep focus, using wide angle lenses to maintain focus from, say, a shoe in the foreground to people yards away, to the truly extreme closeups of only shifting eyes, is cinematic genius.\n\nThere is not one actor that's off in this film. And the writing - three men pursuing a hidden treasure, through the back yard of the Civil War - is outstanding work, with just enough comic relief to give you a chance to relax from the countless number of climaxes throughout.\n\n\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,\" is the benchmark of not only westerns, but of filmmaking in general. This film, released in 1966, stands at #5 of the top 250 films, which says volumes, especially with over a quarter million votes. And GBU only won one award?"

The only downside of these movies is the length of the third movie. It dragged a little in the middle, however it doesn't take away from the greatness of the triology."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is often hailed as the pinnacle of spaghetti westerns, but for me, it didn't quite reach legendary status. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid film with some great elements, but there were a few things that just didn't click.\n\nThe plot revolves around three characters - the bounty hunter Joe (Clint Eastwood), the outlaw Tuco (Eli Wallach), and the mercenary Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) - all in pursuit of buried treasure. The dynamic between them is entertaining, and their performances are memorable. Plus, Ennio Morricone's iconic soundtrack is, without a doubt, unforgettable and a huge highlight of the film.\n\nHowever, despite these strengths, the movie felt a bit too long and slow-paced for my taste. There were moments where I found myself losing interest, especially during the seemingly endless close-ups of squinting eyes and drawn-out scenes meant to build suspense.\n\nTuco's character, while initially interesting, became increasingly obnoxious and overbearing, making it hard to stay fully engaged. And although the film's gritty realism and rugged aesthetics were impressive, the story itself felt somewhat predictable and lacked the creative spark that could have made it truly exceptional.\n\nOverall, \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is a great western, but it's not the flawless masterpiece that many claim it to be. It's worth watching for its cultural impact and stellar music, but don't be surprised if you find yourself checking the time once or twice."

        "review_detailed_main": "Clint Eastwood. Lee Van Cleef. Eli Wallach. Sad Hill Cemetery. Hidden Gold. With these five elements, Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone build what for many of us is the best ending in Seventh Art history. But before talking about the ending, it is essential that we review the events that have led us to such a situation and, what is even more important, the characters who, in one way or another, are predestined to face each other. On the one hand, we have Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, who is probably the character that viewers will most easily sympathize with. His motivation is simple: making money, and he has no problem about crawling on the floor or being humiliated to get it. Sergio Leone is in charge of constantly emphasizing these personal traits, summarized in the following sentence: where we were born, in order not to die of hunger, we had to choose, be a priest or a bandit. Next to him, we have Blondie, played by Clint Eastwood. No one doubts that his main motivation is to earn money, but it is undeniable that he is a character with greater pride, it means that he is not willing to take the money if he must kneel for it. He is a cold, calculating and intelligent character, and those adjectives are also useful when talking about Sentenza, played by Lee Van Cleef, who is not much different from Rubio, but with an even more evil and perverse background. The construction of characters throughout the film is simply wonderful, the picture shows us different scenes and situations in which we can draw conclusions about the behavior of each of the protagonists. The photography follows a very similar style to that of Leone's other films, with its characteristic zooms to the faces of the characters, which somehow help us to understand the emotions they express even more easily. Leone is also capable of managing the narrative tempo and tightening the dramatic chord in certain scenes, without forgetting that we are watching a Spaghetti Western and that, by definition, it should be entertaining for the viewer. The soundtrack should not even be commented, because Ennio Morricone once again creates one of those soundtracks that remain in the public's head for centuries, being part of popular culture and representing an entire cinematographic genre such as the Spaghetti Western. However, and although it is undeniable that the first two hours and twenty minutes of the film are of impressive quality, it is the last twenty minutes that make it one of the greatest classics in Seventh Art history. The ending is so good that we don't have to talk deeply about technical topics to understand and analyze its greatness, I think it seems unfair to have to talk about photography, editing, performances, music, etc. when talking about this ending. And the thing is, I truly believe that the magic of the ending is that, unlike in many other so charged with drama endings, the characters end up behaving as planned, just as the script has shown us throughout the film, being faithful to the script and, consequently, to the viewers. In that instant, you realized that The Good behaves as good fellows do, The Bad ends as bad guys end, and The Ugly ends up depending on the honor of good men. It is at that moment that Clint Eastwood looks at Eli Wallach and says: it seems just like old times. It is at that moment that you understand that everything fits, and then the music, photography and editing merge into a same element, and each character ends as the title of the picture suggests: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bearing in mind that I think westerns are an American art form and I have an aversion to the European made ones, Sergio Leone's The Good The Bad And The Ugly has a lot to recommend it. Not the least of which the impact it had on Clint Eastwood's career making him an American icon.\n\nThe Good The Bad And The Ugly follows an odyssey of three men, two of them a pair of lowlifes and the third no better than he ought to be in a search for buried gold.\n\nIt's quite the odyssey that Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef in those title roles have in search of the loot. A minor theater of the Civil War is operating in the west and all of them get caught up in it as well.\n\nClint Eastwood developed and honed his laconic and cynical character who was in fact a good guy. Which gives you some idea of the bad guys he faced in his western films. Note that Clint Eastwood also never returned to the spaghetti western after this film.\n\nVan Cleef is his usual mean self, perhaps exponentially so. One thing about him is that he's a hired killer with a strong work ethic so I guess that counts for something. When he takes a contract he follows through. As for Wallach he dusts off his Mexican bandit characterization that served him so well in The Magnificent Seven is dusted off and embellished. At one point he's got Eastwood at his sadistic mercy, but when he learns of the loot, Wallach's greed gets the better of him.\n\nI don't consider this the great classic that many do, but The Good The Bad And The Ugly will satisfy most western fans."

This horror of a movie lasts for unbearable 3 hours and makes it painful and slow. Nobody saves the film - even Clint Eastwood seems to be utterly bored, Wlach is at best bemused, and even the superb soundtrack by Enio Morricone does not help deliver this devastating bomb of terribly long and slow close-ups, unnecessary silly dialogs, inconclusive battle scenes, meddled plot and gray, dry, grainy tempo. This gray, sandy, grainy landscape illustrates the film's misery best of all - it is not captivating, nor does it manage to hold attention for a speck of time. It just rags along ploddingly and leaves no place for any serious delivery or dynamics. Do not watch this meddle, waste of time merely"

Now, as as far as Clint's westerns go, I much prefer The Outlaw Josey Wales and my all time favorite movie Unforgiven to this. Granted, this is only a personal preference mind you. Even so, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is a tremendous film and the biggest and best of The Dollars Trilogy. This is a true artist at the top of his game with a truly unique take on the Western genre that is an unforgettable cinematic epic that was a game changer for westerns and movies in general. The film still looks great and while there were lots of spaghetti westerns that would follow, no one did it like Sergio Leone."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good the Bad, and the Ugly is a spaghetti western film starring Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef. The film is directed by Sergio Leone and is the conclusion to the Dollars Trilogy, which also starred Clint Eastwood. The film centers on three outlaws who are on the hunt to find a fortune in gold buried in a cemetery. To kick-start this review off I will mention that this is the final chapter in the Dollars Trilogy. The Dollars Trilogy are three spaghetti films starring Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name. And these three movies are major influences that have inspired countless western films to come. But unlike the first two films, I think I speak for everyone in saying that this is the film that brings a breath of fresh air to the western genre. Even though the movie is called The Good the Bad, and the Ugly, the movie does display its good, bad, and ugly side to things. I don't know if it was Sergio Leone's intention to go all out in the final chapter and have this be his magnum opus, but he needs to work on the run time. This movie is three hours and in those three hours the movie felt like it was all over the place as we focus on these three outlaws hunting for buried treasure, but then it jumps to the American Civil War. There just needed to be some common ground on whoever wrote the script, but I didn't feel any connection. And when this movie was released, people didn't like it and received criticism as well. And in a way I feel like I fit that category because I didn't like it after it was finished, but it grew on me after. But ignoring its three-hour run time, the movie does make up for its brilliant dialogue, acting, and the music department. The music does a great job building that suspense feeling and I as I was watching this zoning in and out, as soon as that theme song kicked in, I knew I was in for a ride. And that last scene alone is enough for me to say that you should definitely watch this if you're not a fan of the western genre. I'm not the biggest fan of western genres, but Clint Eastwood makes any western movie enjoyable to watch that no other western character can top Clint Eastwood's charm and charisma. So in the end, even though this movie is three hours long to the point where it bore me to tears, the movie grew on me to the point that I realize while it may not be the best movie of the western genre, its still the one western movie I would recommend watching regardless if you hate western movies."

The plot twists and meanders and takes it's time, and I'm saying that's good! We go on this epic journey as the lives of our three stars criss and cross and we really experience the crazy fortunes (and misfortunes) life can throw at you.\n\nAlthough I have not watched enough westerns to be any kind of expert, I think you can just feel \"cinema masterpiece\" when you watch this film. There are so many unique touches, quotable lines and atmospheric moments you'll come away from it caterwauling \"Ah-a-ah-a-aaahhhh..... wha, wha wha....\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Most of what comes to mind when I hear the words \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" has already been addressed in prior reviews below. There are few words that describe the brilliance of such a movie, but considering as how this film remains (to this day) to be one of my all-time favorites, I thought I should compose a few to express my fond opinion about it for anyone who has not yet experienced the pleasure of seeing it.\n\nTo put it simply, this movie is utter perfection; the endless landscapes, the classic gun skirmishes, the solid performances, the incredible soundtrack... No western has even caught GLIMPSE of the heights to which this film soars, let alone reached them. This is not just the greatest western, it is one of the best films ever made, with almost no notable exceptions.\n\nThe music is utter brilliance. The theme song will be playing through your mind for weeks, if it has not already. Ennio Morricone is at his all-time best here, delivering one of the most poetic and outstanding soundtracks for any western (or, arguably, any film), period. And yes, Metallica fans, THIS is the true way that \"The Esctasy of Gold\" is meant to be heard: in its original version.\n\nThe camera-work is also of high notability. From the huge wide-angle shots of the walloping scenery to the close-and-tight views of the characters' narrowed eyes, the contrast in camera shots will turn even the slower scenes into sheer excitement.\n\nStorywise, this film is without equal. The beautiful simplicity of a bounty hunter-turned-treasure hunter, his unlikely bandit partner and their evil rival racing to find $200,000 in Confederate gold is truly spectacular; but what makes it even more memorable is the broadness and scope on the jarring reality of the Civil War. In truth, this story isn't just about three men, but rather three men and their journey amidst the brawling past of a struggling nation, which is depicted fantastically. And the finale of the Trio Duel has got to be one of the most cinematically and musically excellent sequences ever captured on camera. Some may cringe when they learn that the film lasts a good 2.5 hours, but nowhere has a film of this length felt more fitting.\n\nTo describe the cast is nearly impossible. Lee Van Cleef puts up one of his greatest performances here--he seems BORN to play \"Angel Eyes\". His presence on-screen is truly what drives the story and conflict. Eli Wallach delivers an outstanding role as Tuco; his hilarious dialog and occasional brawls with Blondie make him by far one of the most memorable characters to graze any form of theater. Clint Eastwood is truly something to behold. Although Clint is definitely one of my favorite all-time actors, this is not quite my absolute favorite performance of his (admitedly because he's not quite as bad-ass as in, say, A Fistful of Dollars); however, this point is hardly worth mentioning, because his role as Blondie adds the perfect contrast to the others' personalities. While Angel Eyes and Tuco are considerably violent-natured, Blondie is much more passive; he rarely partakes in conflict except when he absolutely has to, but when he does he delivers the ultimate punishment to anyone dumb enough to stand in his way. In some ways, I think the movie wouldn't have been nearly as effective if Clint's character had stolen the show. Either way, every character is simply rounded and chiseled to perfection; there is no room for improvement here.\n\nTo sum it all up, this movie is simply breathtaking. It's absolutely fantastic; it's utterly brilliant. The music, the plot, the characters, and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone make this \"Spaghetti-Western\" hardly JUST a spaghetti-western and hardly worth any point of criticism. I have rated this movie a 10 because, unfortunately, there is no higher number available to select (believe me, I would rate this film a 200 if I had the chance). If you have yet to see this film, you must make it an objective to watch it--regardless of whether you like the genre or not. If you've been searching for a film that you could finally term \"THE BEST MOVIE EVER,\" then look no further. It is right here, and it's called: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."

Blondie is so mysterious, laid back, quiet, sly, sneaky, and tricky. But at the same time, he does what he knows is right, and will not rip anyone off unless they had it coming.\n\nThe Bad: Lee Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes, who is quick to show that he is the bad guy. Angel Eyes is very educated, well-connected, sly, and very determined. Angel Eyes pulls a lot of strings to get what he wants, and will stay on task until it is done.\n\nThe Ugly: Eli Wallach plays Tuco, a sleazy, sniveling, thief. Tuco is very sneaky, and usually will steal from almost anyone, including his own partners. However, as evil as Tuco is, he also has a good side. He does occasionally do what is right. Although it is sometimes still in his own benefit, he will still go out of his way to do it. And this cross between good and bad is what makes Tuco such an interesting and well-liked character.\n\nThe story is very winding, but in a good way. Some parts make you wonder if you are still watching a spaghetti movie or not.\n\nWith a long (but still very interesting) plot, great characters, and many excellent scenes, The Good, the Bad and The Ugly is sure to please western fans of all kinds. The movie deserves its place at #4 on IMDb's top 250 (as of 5/9/08).\n\n10/10"

Only a very few movies can reach the musical heights of GBU (Conan the Barbarian is one that comes to mind).\n\nFor me only 2 movies in Clint Eastwood's catalogue are better than this, High Plains Drifter and The Outlaw Josey Wales. Both being epic westerns.\n\nIts a masterful movie that works in part because if its lack of details (like a name for The Man With No Name) and the pacing. It takes its time to deliver the story and actually makes their quest for gold feel like a quest.\n\nThis movie should be banned from remakes."

Only Joe knows the name of the grave, therefore there is a great dispute between the two gunmen, but always keeping Joe alive. This is a really classic western movie. This movie has never been released on VHS in Brazil, and only now the distributor Fox do Brasil' released on DVD format. I am a great fan of Sergio Leone, and the first DVD I bought for my collection was 'Once Upon the Time in America'. 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is great in all aspects: the story is very funny, the actors have great performances, and the soundtrack from Enio Morricone is unforgettable: it is certainly one of the most beautiful and known in the cinema history. This movie is really a great entertainment. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Tr\u00eas Homens em Conflito\" (\"Three Men in Conflict\")"

Searching the shops for them i found that they came in a box set with a third film, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. I hadn't seen THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY at the time but I liked the first two so I thought that I would buy the whole box set, as that was all that was available at the time. What I didn't realise until after I watched all three was how great THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was and I thought that the first two were good. it turned out that THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was the best of the three. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was probably the only film I had ever bought on DVD without having seen it before and I'm SO glad I did. This film is excellent and although i have seen it many times it still stands up well after multiple viewings. it may be nearly three hours long but it is never boring. all the elements work so well (music, acting, dialogue, setting etc...) i can't really find fault in it. i liked it so much i bought the special edition DVD just to see the extra footage incorporated into the film. if you've not seen this, then rent it because i guarantee you'll soon be buying it shortly afterwards"

But it doesn't because it's from the 1960s.\n\nClint's performance is great and so cool, but the rest is meh, and Eli Wallach is actually super annoying, and his reactions is overacting.\n\nIt's a 3-hour-long movie that could have been a 1-hour-30 or 1-hour-15-minute good movie, but the director chose to make every scene 12 minutes long without needing to and that made the movie boaring, I respect all people who see this as a 10 or 9-star movie, but I really can't see why they think that about this movie. My advice is to watch it once just to have the experience of watching it and forming your own opinion about it."

The fine story, with a wonderful photography and adequate music of the greatest film music composer E. Morricone plus the rhythm generates a masterpiece. Does not need forget the excellent actors whose merit is the big for a global impression.\n\nThanks!\n\nBilow"

Leone doesn't rush scenes; sometimes we have shots up to five minutes without dialogue.\n\nTension chews nearly every scene as we observe the eyes and hands of the characters. It's as much a film of greed and civil war, as it is about deception.\n\nThe acting is perfect all round. Clint, Wallach and Cleef are all amazing in their roles. They manage to live up to their roles of good, bad and ugly well, but it's not as clear cut as that. The characters in this film are all morally ambiguous and so they should be. At a time like the civil war, even the \"good\" can be \"ugly\".\n\nGreat direction, superb acting and amazing style. The film is very efficient at telling its story - and the ending is amazing.\n\nDefinitely watch this."

Eastwood plays his part with excellence as do the other two actors. Especially Eli Wallach is perfect in his role of Tuco. The music of Ennio Morricone is also the best!

Some old films like Harakiri stand the test of time and are brilliant to this day, others like Apocalypse Now are super borefests. Funnily enough, the god the bad and the ugly is neither. It is a rather enjoyable movie that starts strong and introduces the three main characters nicely. The pace is fine although I find some of the subplots a bit unnecessary making the movie too long. Clint Eastwood is born for this role but the other two are also interesting characters in their own ways. All in all, it is a rather enjoyable movie to kill some time but it definitely doesn't belong in the top 250 movies even accounting for its legacy."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good, The Bad, The Ugly (1966)\n\nA classic? Well, not so fast. Are we really okay with brutal (if brief) mistreatment of women, fast and senseless bloodshed, and lots of bad overdubbing of dialog?\n\nMaybe.\n\nYes, this is a cinematic movie, and if you can overlook its flaws (some) you will be wowed and dazzled by its merits (very many).\n\nOverflowing with archetypes, filmed with huge widescreen effect, brimming with familiar scenes vividly re-imagined, this is a movie that is dramatic (or ironic) in softspoken (or cynical) ways. There are gunslinging shootouts, long lonesome treks across the desert, and showdowns between tough guys. Yup. And it's all built around a story that leads scene after scene to one big moment after another. There's no question this is a movie that is great fun to watch. In fact, for its visuals, the sheer cinematography and sets and editing, this is as good as it gets, amazing stuff. The man behind that was Tonino Delli Colli, the cinematographer for some other of director Sergio Leone's legendary movies beyond this one: Once Upon a Time in the West, and Once Upon a Time in America (and well as the astonishing Life is Beautiful.) But overall, for its content, its plot, its message (if that matters), is TGTBTU a great film, a masterpiece?\n\nWell, the movie is smart. It deliberately plays off of its genre, which had worn itself thin by the 1960s, so things push over the top in a campy, awesome, excessive way. It almost feels obliged to revisit and exaggerate all the themes of American Westerns, including the Civil War, including slapping women around and killing people in a flurry of fast six-shooter magic. Even the title makes clear this is about a stripped down, pumped up version of older classics.\n\nWhatever his aura over time, Clint Eastwood is no great actor, not in my book, and here he is easily out shined by Eli Wallach, who plays a less attractive type, and by Lee Van Cleef, who plays a more attractive one. But Eastwood isn't meant to be acting, not exactly. He has aura. He's stoic and inscrutable, exaggerated make-up and all, and he shoots a mean Colt, or Smith and Wesson, something classy and throbbing. He's a great archetype, in a movie that is about archetypes. It's not a \"realistic\" movie, of course, not at all, and it's actually a comedy at times, overall, and it's totally fun and never laughable.\n\nGo ahead, compare it to The Wild Bunch, and then to Butch Cassidy, both coming just after this one (and no doubt influenced by it). Both of these later movies have more impressive acting, and more intense intentions (both in brutal violence and in cinematic innovation). But all three have a similar effect, playing within a genre that has always, since the 1939 Stagecoach, been beautifully trapped by its limitations (that's part of its staying power for fans). The Searchers (1956) and High Noon (1952), for starters, are working within the genre, and gnawing at it, as if its something to feed off of. That's where The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly really shines. I have trouble with aspects of it, but I really like it in a bigger sense, looking the other way as needed. I switch to first person because I think it's a personal preference, and a lot of guys I know love the movie to pieces, and a couple women I know think it's either stupid or insulting or boring (actually boring!).\n\nIt's an Italian production, which explains some of the out of sync dubbing. Sergio Leone obviously has an intuitive sense of what makes a movie moving, something sorely missed in a lot of productions since. It's gritty, dirty, and it pounds \"profound\" hard in a male kind of \"toughness prevails\" way. Sorry guys, but bite that bullet. Oh, and the soundtrack? Amazing, perfect, and rising above the movie, which is great in its own way, I admit."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let's backtrack for a minute here. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (GBU), is the most famous of the Spaghetti Westerns, however, the Spaghetti Western was around a little bit before the release of GBU. The term basically describes Western films, based on American history, that were made in Europe, most notably Italy and Spain. Some also were made in Mexico and they all came out in the theaters in the 60s & 70s. It is actually a critical term that American critics coined in the 60s, making fun of these films, because America was so used to the TV westerns that filled the airwaves. But, as time moved forward, the term became acceptable, as well as, the movies themselves. It turned into a positive term, because these films were really good, but a little too different for some. These films now have achieved critical acclaim today, long after their release.\n\nGBU is the third film in a series known as \"The Man with No Name\" trilogy, directed by legendary, Italian film director, Sergio Leone. The musical score was done by master film composer, Ennio Morricone. He would later go on to do the score for Brian De Palma's Untouchables (1987), another great movie and favorite of mine.\n\nGBU is that classic story about three completely different guys, the good one (Clint), the bad one (Van Cleef) and the ugly one (Wallach). It has a wonderful collection of colorful, interesting supporting characters that help propel this film to its exciting end. Its so well, craftily done that you don't even notice the basic, simple plot of three outlaws, in the ultimate struggle to see, who can find the gold from a heist that was hidden away. This also helps to bring forward the time period that the film wants to establish, being as the gold was stolen from a Confederate stash during the Civil War. Eastwood and Wallach's characters get intertwined with each other, while Van Cleef's, Angel Eyes, always is looking for an opportunity to kill them both. It's a great story.\n\nEli Wallach almost killed himself a couple times in this film. Issues with stunts and poor safety measures almost did some of the work for Angel Eyes. Eli Wallach is brilliant and funny in this film too. This is Clint Eastwood at his best. Clint's character also influenced Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), in Back to the Future III (1990). Having mixed language-speaking actors also complicated matters. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach all spoke English, but most of the rest of the cast was Italian or Spanish, hence the need for dubbing. Sergio Leone spoke hardly any English, so he and Wallach communicated by speaking French to each other and the others had interpreters.\n\nCharles Bronson was originally chosen to be in Lee Van Cleef's \"Bad\" roll, but declined to be in the film. There is no dialogue in the first eleven minutes of the film, but who cares. GBU's strongest link is its dreamy-like imagery mixed in with amazing, mesmerizing music. This is what film is all about and this is the definitive Western.\n\n9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."

I loved every minute of this film. Awesome acting, brilliant location and breathtaking musical score!! Could easily have gone right back to the start and watched it all over again. I actually watched The Godfather the day before and really wasn't that impressed with it. This movie should be number one for sure. It's really tense, edge of your set viewing.

This movie is drier than its' desert scenes. The technical flaws previously mentioned are by themselves enough to disqualify this \"epic\" from consideration. Also, I can't understand the comments of those who, after watching it a second time, declare what was once a certain piece of dog-do, a \"Masterpiece\". What are you thinking????

No context. Simply letting yourself be carried away by the betrayal and the memorable performances that will transport you with epic and iconic music to one of the most shocking scenes in cinema."

And it has the all time greatest film score by Ennio Morricone.\n\nThis movie is a grand, epic masterpiece. There is a reason it's one of the top rated movies in IMDb. It must be the larger than life characters. Or the beautiful cinematography in vast Western settings. Or the aforementioned greatest film score ever. Or that distinct style of Sergio Leone film making - where everyone has an interesting face even if not conventionally beautiful - where it's almost like some kind of Italian opera. If you have any kind of interest in classic movies, you need to see this one."

It is the more rewarding if we consider that this single movie made me a cinema lover in the first place, a Clint fan in the second, and has kept me tied to a screen for the best part of 35 years.\n\nBut to all the young cinema-goers who read this and might be wondering why I say this, I must remind them that in 1970 Leone was not, repeat, was not, the mythical director that he is today, and Clint not only hadn't won any Oscar, on the contrary, most of the critics were just killing him for the same reasons the whole world loves him today. The guy can't act, of course his directorial debut (Play misty for me) is not SO bad, but sure he won't make it on the long run, etc.\n\nIf you told the Kaels, Eberts or Denbys of that time that one day TGTBTU would be considered not only the BEST WESTERN EVER, but among the 20 best films ever, they would have had a diabetic coma. I remember writing to Spanish movie magazines to make sure they gave TGTBTU its due, only to be scorned at and being said you guy better change hobbies, maybe chess, bird spotting or something, because as a cinema-as-art reviewer you're pitiful.\n\nOf course today this seems a heresy, but I assure you, down in 1970 spaghetti westerns were very \"seriously panned\" and considered to be a sub genre in any branch of the 7 arts, down there with graffiti or comics, or steel drum music.\n\nIt has taken a whole new generation of moviegoers and the expansion of DVD to reverse this long standing apprehension about TGTBTU. Thanks to them this absolute master piece of cinema has been enshrined where it belongs, where it has belonged all these 35 years, but now at least there's a way to certify it and make sure it will remain there forever.\n\nAnd Clint, read my words, one day you will win the best actor Oscar, and that'll be it."

Not the first time I notice, that films of 60..70-s are much better transmit the picture for viewer, directors of that time exactly knew what to show. Tongue does not turn to call the special effects \"pure\" or \"funny\", cos they seems more real in this picture, than all modern effect together. The great soundtrack was the thing, because of which goose appears on my hands and the room fill with heroes's tension and resoluteness.

        "review_detailed_main": "\u00a8You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig.\u00a8 I wonder what would've been of Clint Eastwood's career if it weren't for the \u00a8Dollars\u00a8 trilogy. Before working with Italian filmmaker, Sergio Leone, he had a career as a television actor in Rawhide, a western based TV series, but he couldn't get a decent job in Hollywood so he began to look for work abroad. He reached international success thanks to Leone's reinvented spaghetti westerns: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966), known as the \u00a8Dollars\u00a8 trilogy. He proved producers wrong because they thought that people wouldn't pay to see movies of actors they could see for free on television, but audiences were more than willing to see him in the big screen. His pairing with Leone couldn't have worked out better for him since the director's trademark was combining long wide shots with extreme close-ups. These wide shots couldn't have been enjoyed as much on the small television sets at home. Eastwood's rough features and manly charisma also contributed to Leone's success, and both seemed destined to work with each other. There is no need to see the previous \u00a8Dollars\u00a8 movies as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly stands out on its own and is actually a prequel since the movie takes place during the Civil War in the early 1860's before the other plots take place and they are all separate stories that only have Clint Eastwood's character in common. When I see Eastwood's latest films as a director I can't help but think how much he was influenced by the great Sergio Leone. He must have learned a great deal working with the Italian director in this masterpiece. It is just shot beautifully and to perfection by Leone, the cinematography and scenery are amazing and feel real, and the score is perfect. Eastwood may be a different director than Leone was, but he pays close detail to his craft and also knows how to shoot beautifully.\n\nThe plot is pretty simple for a movie that is about three hours long, but Leone's use of the camera and extended shots makes the film longer. He also adds several side stories that work really well in the narrative. The film begins by introducing each character (although in the opposite order: The Ugly, The Bad, and The Good). The film begins with an extreme close up on a bounty hunter (Al Mulock) and then when we see the wide shot there are three of them who are quietly entering a bar. Once the men enter we hear three shots and out comes Tuco, also known as The Ugly (Eli Wallach), who escapes. In the next scene we are introduced to The Bad, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), who is tracking down a peasant farmer. The scene is truly a classic as no words are spoken for about ten minutes, but the tension can be felt. Angel Eyes is actually looking for information on the location of a treasure of coins lost during the Civil War and he is told a soldier named Bill Carson has it. Finally, we are introduced to Blondie, The Good (Clint Eastwood), who saves Tuco from a group of men who want to turn him in because there is a reward on his head. Blondie saves him only to collect the reward himself, but once Tuco is about to be hanged he shoots the rope and sets him free as part of a scam in which they divide the money. They later turn against each other only to discover the location of the treasure that has been buried and the race begins to see who can get to the treasure first as the three men have different information regarding its whereabouts.\n\nThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is my all-time favorite Western. Any other film in the genre will always be measured by its standards. The opening scene in which we are introduced to Angel Eyes (The Bad) is just so beautifully shot that no dialogue was needed and we were already hooked (Ennio Morricone's amazing score can also take some credit for that). The first ten minutes have no dialogue whatsoever but it sets up the general tone of the movie: several wide shots where we can see the great landscape and deserts combining them with extreme close ups of the characters facial expressions, the tension and suspense is built with long and slow scenes and suddenly the violence happens so quickly that we are caught off guard. The film doesn't celebrate violence, it portrays it truthfully. The main character is the quiet Blondie (The Good), but without a doubt Tuco (The Ugly) is the one who has the most lines and brings some unbalance and goofiness to an otherwise serious picture. One of the funniest scenes is when he is in the tub and one of the bounty hunter shows up to kill him but before shooting he begins the classic speech villains tend to give and Tuco pulls out his gun and fires at him saying, \u00a8When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.\u00a8 Tuco plays a key role and his character is kind of the gray in an otherwise black (Angel Eyes) and white (Blondie), good guy and bad guy western movie. He breaks the conventionality in the genre. The final Mexican standoff scene is also truly memorable and one of the best shot sequences. This is a truly unique film that has stood the test of time; it catapulted Eastwood into a movie star, and has influenced him on his way to becoming a great director. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of my all time favorite movies and is a must see film.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "I generally don't like westerns and I was not a fan of the previous two installments in this \"trilogy\", but this film is undeniably a legendary masterpiece. This is the mother of westerns. Can't find many weak points and I have to admit it has to be one of the best movies ever.\n\nFirst of all, the music must be mentioned. Ennio Morricone's score is unbeatable. It is undoubtedly one of the best scores ever. The film would have been nothing without the music. Scenes, where Tuco runs around for several minutes, would have been boring without the music. Add the music and you have one of the most iconic scenes ever. You can not look at a western movie without hearing this music play. It's so iconic that even if you have not seen the movie, you will have heard the score.\n\nIt's an old film with old camera technology. This is where the film may lose many viewers. The last thing a western film - which is mostly set in an ugly and bleak desert - needs is bad cinematography. The cinematography is good for its time, but of course, it is not as strong today almost 60 years later. The camera work is impressive, but the technology hinders it. Fortunately, the score saves the sometimes very blurry and low-resolution images.\n\nThe composition is perfect. So many new movies are heavily inspired by the photography from this movie. Director Sergio Leone is a master of visual storytelling. Many scenes do not even contain dialogue, but it is still clear what is going on. Small grimaces from the actor or small movements from the camera tell us enough. It is perfect.\n\nAn example of visual storytelling is the scene when Tuco tries to find Eastwood's character. He follows a trail where someone has set several campfires. At these campfires, he finds Eastwood's old cigars. We know he's very close when he lifts a cigar and it's still smoking. The end of the film is also an exemplary example of visual storytelling. It is a fantastic feeling when you understand what is happening in the scene without dialogue. It's brilliantly done.\n\nAll actors are good. Both the ugly and the good are good, but the bad gets too little screen time. The bad / Angel Eyes is played very well by Lee Van Cleef. He's a bit creepy while also being very charismatic. Nobody delivers a performance worthy of an Oscar, but it's solid acting from everyone involved.\n\nIn conclusion, a legendary film that everyone must see. It has inspired countless amazing works. It's hard not to be blown away by epicness when the music plays. The film is as close to perfect as you can get. I understand why this film is still analyzed today. The film is really clever."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's surprising how your memory can play tricks on you. Having watched many westerns in my childhood i could have sworn that i had seen The Good , The Bad and the Ugly . Surely everyone of a certain age has? Well as it turns out i probably hadn't , or if i had i remember nothing of it. This is the final film of the Sergio Leone \" \"Dollars\" or \" man with no name\" trilogy of which i have been watching recently and although this is the most famous of the three ' for me it's not quite the best .\n\nBlondie (The Good) and Tuco (The Ugly) are con artists, trying to steal as much money as possible during the Civil War. Angel Eyes (The Bad) is trying to locate a bank robber going by the name of Bill Carson, in order to collect his stolen gold. After a few scams, Blondie cheats Tuco by keeping his share and leaving him in the dust.\n\nTuco eventually finds Blondie and drags him off into the desert, torturing him in revenge. Then they run into Bill Carson, who tells Tuco the location of a graveyard where his stolen gold is buried. As Tuco looks for water to keep Carson alive long enough to help more, Carson tells Blondie which gravestone marks the buried gold, and dies before he can say more. Angel Eyes soon figures out that they know, and all three want a 50% share of the gold, but only two of them will get it.\n\nThe amazing thing about this superb trilogy is that they all were made within three years. Each movie having it's budget increased. A fistful of dollars - 200K . A few Dollars more - 600K and finally the good , The bad and the ugly 1.1m. In the latter it really shows that leone had a lot more money to spend. Lavish sets , a huge amount of personnel and no doubt an increased salary for the ever popular Clint Eastwood and Lee Van cleef but as any movie fan will tell you an increased budget does not always make a better film .\n\nI have no doubt which is my favourite of the trilogy and that is \" A few dollars More\" . It is the perfect western. This film is not, simply because it's trying to do too much. It's an hour too long and the plot drifts off in different directions. Sure it has all the superb hallmarks of a Sergio Leone western. It looks amazing , it has a wonderful soundtrack and it finishes with typical tense showdown but it's the bits inbetween namely the civil war scenes that distract from what should have been an amazing western.\n\nAngel eyes , the lee van Cleef's character is not engaging enough and i would have loved to have seen him return as Col. Douglas Mortimer who we saw in the previous film instead we get a character who is given third billing behind Blondie and Tuco. In fact the best character is Tuco ' who is played by Eli Wallach and he gets the vast majority of the screen time.\n\nThis lacks the brutality of the previous films and maybe that is because Sergio Leone was going for that wider audience.\n\n8 out of 10"

It's personally not only the most impeccable western film, but any single media ever made and I've ever seen. The most parodied, most competently creation of a film, most recognizable score from Ennio Morricone and Sergio Leone's masterclass of storytelling.\n\nBut there is a interesting aspect of a reason for The Good, The Bad and The Ugly to be unique and a well known cinima. It's because there hasn't been a satire of not only western, but also anything umaginable. And this movie delivers something that becomes so recognizable that later on, other western movies will start looking similar and will give the audience some familiarlilies of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. And proves that no pop-culture media related to western can make an accurate western looking, setting, tone and a good western with parodied to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.\n\nUltimately, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a glorious throwback to the classic that lives forever. Because of how popular it is, it is a heavily implied that this film is more than a special movie. It's an a experience out of any other movies that goes on and so fourth.\n\nI fully recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well first off, having seen so many films, I'm not sure why I waited so long to watch this but I'm glad I finally did, and you should too! It's unbelievably clear to me now where Tarantino borrowed his camera shots and editing techniques from in the likes of KIll Bill and Inglorious Basterds! (I knew about Morricone)\n\nThe film was years ahead of its time, but I have two gripes with this movie that stopped me from giving it the full 10/10.\n\n1: The dubbing- All the foreign actors acted their roles in their native tongues which were dubbed over afterwards. It was quite noticeable and threw me off a bit, I'd much rather a foreign film with subtitles than dubbing any day.\n\n2: A tad too long. I do feel the running time could have been shaved byt 20 mins.\n\nHaving said all that, it's a great film! Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is outstanding and the ending is spectacular.\n\nOverall opinion: Milestone!\n\nOther films from the time I rated 9/10: Cool Hand Luke. Bicycle Thieves. The Italian Job"

        "review_detailed_main": "This week I was fortunate enough to see 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966)' (namely, the 2003 extended English-language version) in the cinema, perhaps the only place that Sergio Leone's classic Spaghetti Western can be properly appreciated. This was my second viewing \u2013 the first being in 2006, when my interest in cinema was still in its infancy \u2013 and, just as Leone's film gained status only in subsequent decades, my admiration has since grown substantially. By the early 1960s, the Western had become a tired genre, and even the best American entries {such as Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)'} could more closely be described as somber rather than thrilling. Leone's low-budget Italian productions breathed new life into the Western, the director's highly-stylised (and purely cinematic) film-making style tackling the recently-emerged Revisionist Western sub-genre with a cheekily-parodic sense of humour.\n\nThough 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' clearly identifies each of its three protagonists with a titular adjective, the separating lines are decidedly blurred. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the archetypal anti-hero, a laconic, cigar-smoking bounty-hunter who makes every word, and every bullet, count. Tuco (Eli Wallach) is a slimy opportunist, a bottom-dweller whose unabashed enthusiasm \u2013 especially opposite the apathetic Eastwood \u2013 makes him an oddly-likable character. Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is a crafty, intelligent schemer, greed and contempt mixing behind those cold, steely eyes. Leon's film revolves almost exclusively around these three characters, and the American Civil War is utilised purely as a historical backdrop. As was the director's style, the film is a triumph of contrasts: an epic period of American history is used merely as a stage for an intimate battle-of-wills between three determined men with their own selfish aims.\n\nContrast, too, is evident through Leone's camera lens. Few directors (perhaps David Lean or Sergei Bondarchuk are his only true rivals in this field) have more inspiringly utilised the cinema screen as a canvas. Leone switches between landscapes and portraits, at times cutting unexpectedly from a distant long-shot to an extreme close-up of Eastwood's sweaty brow, his eyes narrowed and alert. I wrote in my review for 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' that that Leone's landscape was the human face. Unlike Ford, to whom setting was significant (one reason why he so adored Monument Valley), Leone's Westerns unfold in an anonymous landscape, dry and unremarkable and unforgiving. Colour is instead injected through Ennio Morricone's score, perhaps the most memorable ever composed for a film. The composer's contribution is uniquely cinematic, refusing to linger in the background and instead serving to overwhelm and enhance Leone's imagery."

And it's already got a bad manuscript, so it gets even worse.

Abit too long.\n\nClint Eastwood does however a very good performance.\n\nSoundtrack is very iconic and very well made! It fits very good!\n\nA pretty bad start, but after a hour or so the story gets much better and more entertaining.\n\nI understand it was definitely very well made for the time when it was made, but still got some plot holes and some things it fails with.\n\nWatchable, but dont expect too much from it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I avoided seeing this film for many years. As a whole, I do not like westerns, they are typically clich\u00e9d and hokey. Finally after reading the raving reviews and a strong urge by my film instructor, I rented it. I was blown away and left in awe of Sergio Leone's spaghetti western classic.\n\nThe acting is very intense, especially from Lee Van Cleef's character Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood does a great job as the righteous Blondie, but Van Cleef's character stands out to me more. The camera work is greatly done, especially in the graveyard scene and the associative shots used during the Mexican standoff scene. Being a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, at the end of the movie, I thought to myself \"so that's where he got his inspiration\" (meaning his later works such as the Kill Bill series and Inglorious Basterds). The thing that makes the film to me is the soundtrack. The music is used in very good taste, whether it is the classic theme from the beginning or the use of Ecstacy of Gold during the graveyard scene.\n\nIf you love westerns, this is a definite must. If you do not like westerns, this is still a must for any movie lover. Overall, it's a 10 out of 10 rating for the greatest western ever made and one of the greatest and most influential films of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ok, so I was in junior high when this came out. Doesn't matter. Leone outdid himself. Very engrossing film noire, but with great lighting.\n\nBlondie (Eastwood), is about what you'd expect. A man of few words, and as fast on the draw as he is accurate. In fact he is again, a man with \"no name.\"\n\nVan Cleef is the heartless one of course & plays his part straight up. Lee as well, has no name we know of in the movie. Like Eastwood (Blondie), just a description (Angel Eyes). And not coincidentally I'm sure, an antithetical nickname for such a 'devilish' soul.\n\nBut it's Tuco (Eli Wallach) that's the star of, and steals this movie. It's a role of a lifetime. A rotten SOB who does not possess the evil of Van Cleef of course. I don't know what I can say about the storied career of Eli Wallach. Born in 1915, and he just passed away 10 years ago at 98 years old. If you haven't, take a peek as his method actor + Stage accomplishments.\n\nA funny footnote to this: Maybe 16 years ago, Evelyn and I are taking in the Nancy Myers ROMCOM, The Holiday. There's an early scene where Iris (Kate Winslet), decides to help her elderly neighbor. During their exchange, I suddenly burst out, \"Holy Cow\", you know who that is honey!!??\" She shakes her head. I exclaim; \"It's Eli Wallach!. Take a good look!! It's Tuco from the The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly!!!\" After studying the screen a few moments longer, Evelyn exclaims; \"OMG Bob, it is. Incredible! I never would've guessed it. I didn't even know he was still alive, let alone acting. Wow!\". Eli was almost 92 in this role and sharp as a tack. And, actually had a considerable role in the movie, which of course he aced.\n\nThis movie has great attributes several other reviewers have so aptly delineated. But I'll add my points: I've always known much about Wallach, but felt obligated to share a few other facts I was not previously aware of (ala Wiki).\n\n\n\non-screen bitchenosity while Wallach, really acts. Blondie is a man of few words & Tuco is just the opposite. Just the same, their relationship (in their roles) is what the audience pulls for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, as the two (untrusting partners) ride off together in the stagecoach to pursue the gold;, after Tuco briefly, yet lovingly, talks about his brother's love for him, Blondie offers him a cigar for the ride out. And it is in those moments that ensue, where we see Tuco sport an authentic smile, looking genuinely pleased. Eastwood was really good as well. It's a great scene.\n\n----\n\nEven above Tombstone, this my favorite Western. Everything about the production is almost other-worldly relative to any American Western. Maybe it's a bit fantasy/odyssey by virtue of where it was shot, Morricone's score, and having such an eccentric director. Who knows? Fact is, it's a one of a kind masterpiece in my book.\n\nFinally, the movie incorporates just enough humor to give the viewer an occasional laugh. And most if not all, comes via Tuco, including the scene where he arrives in an unknown town, after being marooned in the desert, and has some fun with a gun shop owner.\n\nSo that's it. The 8.8 IMDb composite rating is good, probably even fair, but it should be a 9.5 or so (in my book.)\n\nI think we have this in VHS, DVD, Blu Ray, and it's currently free on AP.\n\nSo yes indeed, Evie & I highly recommend.\n\nBob R."

Saw this first as a teenager in the 1970s and was glued to the TV along with my two brothers. Great story, acting, scenery, and the score is fantastic. Clint Eastwood plays the Man with No Name who along with Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach hunt for a stolen cash box filled with gold coins buried in a cemetery during the American Civil War. They each know only one part of where the gold is buried so they have to keep each other alive despite the fact they want to kill each other. This 3 hour movie moves along gracefully and never gets boring. The final cemetery scene and standoff between the three main characters is riveting. Once again the score is unforgettable. Yes I have seen this film over 100 times and love every minute of it. Not only a great western but one of the best films ever made!!\n\nWatching this great movie again on TCM in 2016. The difference is they now play the restored extended version with an additional 25 minutes included. These \"new\" scenes makes the story even more riveting and tie in some loose ends. To the director Sergio Leone all I can say is thank you for your talents."

The film is so brilliant in setting up the tone and themes, slipping seamlessly from comedy to tragedy to violent passion and back to comedy again. Every character is designed to perfection, even the little characters who have but minutes of screen time are all interesting and very unique.\n\nCinematography is spot on, with vast panning shots of the western land and also encompasses frequent but well placed close ups of character's faces so as to better read their emotions (or presumed lack of) and dominate the screen. Furthermore, in some shots what the camera cannot see the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with character entrances (Tuco surprised Blondie for example) that cannot be explained by the normal geography of shots.\n\nThe music by Ennio Morricone is absolutely superb and can be both subtle and obvious to drive a scene and enhance the action. The sharp jab of music when the evil Angel Eyes first rides into frame leads to a certain level of unease that cannot be explained any other way apart from the music. Music that has long become legendary and iconic, rightfully so.\n\nThe acting is breath-taking, Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef and every single supporting actor (reluctant to use supporting considering how great the roles are) are perfect.\n\n10/10: You cannot dislike this film, and if you do you're just plain wrong in my eyes"

        "review_title": "6.7/10 - The Embodiment of the Spaghetti Western",
        "review_detailed_main": "Sergio Leone is probably most famous spaghetti western director (western because it's taking place in \"the wild west\", and spaghetti because the directors were often Italian). He has directed some of the most critically acclaimed and widely loved films of all time - Once Upon a Time in America, Once Upon a Time in the West, and this one, which we'll soon get into. I didn't really know what to expect of this one, considering how the other Leone movies I've seen were very different from one another. Either way, this is the first movie I'm reviewing from the IMDb top 10, and I'm very, very hyped. Hopefully the end of this top 100 journey will be interesting.\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a classic western - probably the most well-known western out there. The title refers to our three main characters: The Good is Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the aloof, quiet, handsome outlaw, having more dignity and respect than your average criminal. The Bad is Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a cruel, calculated man who would plot his schemes with no mercy on any innocent bystander. And finally, the Ugly is Tuco Remirez (Eli Wallach), a Mexican criminal with a dirty mouth, all childish and barbaric, with a tidy sum on his head. The three characters, every one of them in his own fashion, discover some information about an unbelievable stash of gold that's hidden somewhere. Once they hear about it they all want to get to it, starting a journey full of dirty tricks, conflicting interests and badass gun duels.\n\nThe first thing I'd like to address here, since my intro is already touching the subject, is the cast. These three are basically the only main characters, and though the side actors generally give good performances, the main cast is great. It's not like the roles are the most emotionally nuanced thing in the world, but each of the main actors fits his character perfectly. Likely one of the main things that helped immortalizing this movie, and yeah, the cast deserves lots of praise for fitting into vibe of each character so smoothly.\n\nNow, Mr. Leone, friend, I have a question for you: is it THAT hard to make a movie that's not long af? It's not like lengthy movies are inherently bad, but it does create a situation where you have to be spot on with everything, especially the pacing, since stuff that could be forgiven in a short movie becomes much more of a pain in a long one. Pacing-wise, I'd say that this one has its ups and downs. The first and the final act are both rather tight and well-structured, while the middle part, I feel, sidetracks more than it should, sometimes feeling a little too slow. Not a huge, glaring issue, but an issue it is.\n\nLet's talk about vibes for a moment. When you think about the vibe that a western ought to have, you think of this rough, gritty badassness, the hot desert sun frying everything in the frame, a lone gunslinger looking into the distance. So yeah, this is exactly what this film is going for - in a way that probably has shaped every western, or western-adjacent movie to come for decades later. There's definitely something memorable here - many cool one-liners, badass shots, unexpected courses of action the make you go \"woah\". I'm overhyping it a bit. It's never reaching to mindblowing levels of badassness, but it has many fun moments and a gritty aesthetic. That's what I'm getting at.\n\nOne element of this film that you all know something about, probably, even if you haven't watched it yet, is the iconic soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. Once this recorder starts playing, you know that you've heard it before, that this soundtrack is the first auditory association you have to the word \"western\". It comes back as a motif through different instruments, and though it feels derivative once in a blue moon, mostly it works really well. And the score in the climax of the film, by the way, is absolutely phenomenal. This guy always delivers.\n\nI make it rule to myself to never spoil anything I review, so I'll be really vague when talking about the climax of this movie: this iconic sequence, especially that famous scene, revolves around a situation that could really be shown to us in a manner that's a lot quicker. The slow-burning nature of the final act is really felt here, and I feel like this is worth mentioning. Pulling you in, guiding you from one person to the other, feeling almost like you can hear the wheels spinning inside their heads. Good stuff.\n\nI hate to be saying it about so many movies lately, but there really is nothing else to it that I can put my finger on: It's just not enough to be really good for me. It's a really well-done western, like I said, but no aspect of it truly blew me away, made me get sucked into this movie, be fully immersed. I get why so many people find it iconic - it is - but I can't agree with it being one of the best movies ever. Not even close for me.\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the embodiment of the western classic. I can see how the cast, the soundtrack and some iconic moments helped to immortalize this movie in pop culture. Despite being pretty badass overall, I don't think it's a masterpiece - far from that - but it was a good watch, one that I mostly enjoyed, especially through the first and the final act. Feeling a 6.7/10 on this one."

This story is just awesome on so many levels, it keeps you watching every minute (even though it's a 2 hour and 40 minute film). The best part is no part really drags, its all toward the main purpose of the story. Watch Hang em high and you'll see a traditional American western get dragged out (i can't stand that flick.) Anyways if you want to watch the film that made westerns popular as well as western games (Red Dead Revolver) watch this film! By the way, the draw at the end is the probably one of the best and creative draws i have ever seen in any western"

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh yeah!, I just Love Spaghetti Westerns Most of All Sergio Leone's Trilogy (Per un Pugno di Dollari, Per Qualche Dollaro in pi\u00f9 and of course Il Buono Il Brutto e Il Cattivo. But I would not rate or comment on this movie only as a Western but as a Motion Picture that is watched by generations and has a great influence on filmmakers today. I watched this film for the first time when I was 13 and I just love it more each time I watch It\n\nIl Buono Il Brutto e Il Cattivo is different from the classic Wayne and Ford Westerns, this movie as all \"Spaghetti Westers\" (called like that because of their Italian Origins and filmmakers like Sergio Leone) They show the darker Uglier and dirtier side of westerns and in my opinion also a more realistic feel to how people really where during the civil war, instead of the usual Twinkle from John Waynes bright teeth, We see three men who are ten times more believable real dirty and gritty. Eli Wallach's superb acting as Tuco (The Ugly) makes him my favorite character in the movie, constantly changing facial expressions based on each situation first he is angry then he is nice, he shows the brutal and greedy side as well as the genuine and caring human side So Thumbs Up Mister Wallach. Clint Eastwood on the other hand is in his usual cool self you see in the other two movies of the No name Trilogy, Very careful on which words he uses as well as not using any words but sending a strong emotion (when he offers his cigar to the wounded man in the broken down house) that cigar makes him unique , apparently Eastwood asked Director Sergio Leone if he could stop using it in some scenes, Leone answered by saying \" If you don't have the cigar, you don't have the same character.\"\n\nThe Screenplay is very original and leaves a lot of suspense in certain scenes, you never get bored or tired although the movie is pretty long you don't feel time passing by you are just captured by the story and cant wait to see what happens next. Of course this film would be only be half as good if it did not have Ennio Morricone's Fantastic Score which sets a perfect mood to each scene, and I am not surprised to see many songs from this scored used in so many other movies, I am surprised it took so long for the Academy Awards to recognize him by giving him an Oscar.\n\nOverall this movie is a must see for Western Lovers and Movie Lovers in general and I am very pleased to see it in IMDb's Top ten Movies.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"You see , In this World there are two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns and those who dig, You dig!.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly remains a cornerstone of the Western genre, showcasing remarkable elements that have cemented its place in cinematic history. While it boasts many strengths, there are also a few aspects that might detract from its overall experience.\n\nThe performances are a significant highlight. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach deliver iconic portrayals that breathe life into their respective roles. Their interactions are a core part of what makes the film so engaging, with each actor bringing depth and charisma to their characters. The cinematography is equally impressive, capturing the vast, arid landscapes with stunning visual composition that enhances the film's epic feel. Sergio Leone's direction crafts a visually arresting and atmospheric experience that pulls viewers into its world.\n\nThe film's themes of betrayal, greed, and survival are explored with a complexity that enriches the narrative. Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is another standout feature, providing a memorable and evocative score that perfectly complements the film's tone and atmosphere.\n\nHowever, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is not without its drawbacks. The film's length can be a challenge, with some scenes feeling prolonged and the pacing occasionally dragging. Additionally, the plot can be a bit confusing at times, especially with its intricate web of double-crosses and shifting allegiances. This complexity might leave some viewers feeling disoriented or struggling to follow the storyline.\n\nIn summary, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly excels with its stellar performances, breathtaking cinematography, and unforgettable soundtrack. While its length and occasionally confusing plot may be minor hurdles, the film's classic status and enduring impact on the Western genre are undeniable."

The only thing that makes it different than other movies is that it does it with style.\n\nAll three of them are of course brilliant. They were given many cool dialogues. Ennio Mariconi's music does half the work. You probably must have heard it. It brings more style and character to the story. Each of the three acted well and lived up to their pet names. Simply by looking at them makes you feel that it's great.\n\nIf you have not seen this movie, don't waste anymore time in reading these reviews. This is a classic movie used almost as a standard to measure any other film's greatness.\n\n\"When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk\"\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "In the last of the so-called 'Dollars' trilogy Eastwood now plays a man called Blondie (despite clearly having brown hair) who has hooked up with Tuco, a bandit with an amusingly long list of crimes, to run a reward-and-release scam with various towns and cities across the Old West. Soon tiring of Tuco's behavior, Blondie ends their volatile partnership and heads off on his own.\n\nAngered by the double-cross, Tuco exacts a laborious revenge on Blondie, but just as the punishment reaches its zenith under a burning hot sun in a remote part of the desert a wagon carrying dead Confederate soldiers interrupts. With his last breath, the sole surviving Rebel tells Tuco of a stash of treasure buried in a cemetery, and, while Tuco is distracted, tells Blondie what grave it is buried under. Their difficult partnership is quickly restored as they trek across the West, through Civil War conflicts, towards the treasure.\n\nSo far I've only covered the Good and Ugly. The Bad just so happens to be Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless mercenary who has also learned of the hidden loot and eventually crosses paths with his rivals. He has the least screen time, but is necessary as a pure villain to lessen the crude vulgarity of Tuco.\n\nIt's a long film. But it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and Sergio Leone allows himself plenty of time and space to indulge in quirky idiosyncrasies. I especially like Tuco having a bubble bath in the midst of his current location being blown to smithereens.\n\nVillains always interest me, and actors mostly choose villains over heroes as they make for better characters. Blondie may comfort dying soldiers and play with kittens, but he's just too bland. Angel Eyes, is hardcore, and a better character, but he's nothing compared to Tuco. Eli Wallach owns this film, and takes most of the screen time away from Eastwood and Van Cleef. The scene where he searches the cemetery, as the camera spins around and around and around has such a beautiful innocence to it. Even though Tuco may have killed and robbed many this scene makes him seem like an easily excitable child at heart. It's absolutely wonderful.\n\nIf you've got an evening free, and just don't know how to spend 3 otherwise empty hours, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a fine way to spend them."

The music is a bit better than a 30's John Wayne epic but certainly not great- Leone did some good stuff later-but he used the faults of this thing to learn and correct himself- Clint E was in a interview about the movie before it was shown(on TMC) He was a older than in the movie, but a lot younger than we know him now He said Leone taught & showed him many skills-it shows!\n\nSo see it, but don't expect that much"

Since then i still feel the same way when i see that film. Despite the large amount of films that i have seen since then this movie still remains the best film i have ever seen. I think Leone was a man with a very certain idea about cinema that personally finds me agreed. Of course that's just my opinion and i just want you to respect it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've chosen to review a very amazing movie whose directors, players and music artists are pure legends, I am talking about the Sergio Leone, Eli Wallach, Lee Van Clef, Clint Eastwood and Ennio Morricone and the movie \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (Italian: Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, lit. '\"The good, the ugly, the bad\"'). First, I would like to stress out the movie setting and its history. In the 1960's Western movies were becoming very popular, the Hollywood Westerns included heroes that were often well groomed, had nice clothing, had charismatic voices and shiny new guns, often times very good gunslingers that fought the bad guys and always won. The Spaghetti Western on the other hand was usually a low budget movie recorded in Italy, most often in Sicily, hence the name. Spaghetti Westerns were usually very violent and included not heroes but anti-heroes who usually worked for their own personal gain, this made the movies appear way more realistic. It is also noteworthy to say that that the music in the Hollywood Westerns was much simpler, chilling and relaxing, the music of the Spaghetti Westerns was almost always really energetic, took a lot of effort and increased in tone and frequency as the time went by. The last thing I would like to add is that we often think that the US Civil war was an entirely moral war, with the North being the good guys and the south the bad ones but even though most Hollywood Westerns' timeline happened in 1860's, the US Civil War was almost entirely ignored, this is contrasted by the Spaghetti Westerns who saw the neither side as good, they would show that both sides were bleeding each other dry and both sides committed atrocities, denying the enemy basic human rights. In this movie we find 3 main characters, the \"Good\", we do not know his name but he is often called \"Blondie\" by the \"Ugly\" who's known as \"Tuco\". The third character, \"The Bad\" is known by his alias \"Angel Eyes\". All of these 3 characters are excellent gunslingers and have 1 goal in life; personal gain. All the characters interact with each other in the movie, sometimes working together and sometimes trying to kill each other, often times by outwitting instead of using blunt force. The characters in the movie often don't use too much dialogue, but say more by saying less thus stressing out the important part. Lastly, I would like to talk about this movie's scenography and music. The music was mostly composed by 1 man; Ennio Morricone. The music rarely overlaps with the dialogue, which leaves the viewer to listen to what the characters say better. The director and the music artist had a talent of working together, there are scenes in the movie where the music is used primarily to build up tension and to incite action, for this reason the music is only used when the characters are or are acting silent for example: when characters are sneaking or are under threat. Overall, the movie is widely recognised as a masterpiece and I agree, every single moment is either deeply embedded to the storyline or is action based, one can start watching this movie from any timeline and still find it interesting. For all these unique factors the movie offers I can do nothing but recommend it for everyone to watch."

The ultimate scene in the movie is, when tuco,\"who was eager to know the name of the cemetery from bill Carson, will kick Blondie when he was lying beside bill, but when bill dies and Blondie says that he knows the name of the cemetery, tuco suddenly cares for Blondie. This film has an excellent duologue's by making to understand the viewer indirectly. I think this movie has a best climax than any other movie. Adios.........."

But until now i have seen this film so many times!! And I must say, with every looking, this film gets better and better. I have also seen the two other films of the \"Dollar\"-trilogy and this film is the best by far. The sense of humor of this film is the key factor. Especially the performance of Eli Wallach is outstanding. For me the best actor ever. On the one side there are great actors (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef) and on the other side there is a remarkable storyline. It's a story about three \"criminals\" who are playing some tricky games during the war between the South States and the North States. All in all its a very entertaining film with much suspense and great music! 10 points out of 10!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Released in 1966 and directed by Sergio Leone, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" stars Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach as the titular three men (respectively) who are after hidden gold, buried in a Civil War cemetery somewhere. Of course, none of these men trust each other and the Civil War happens to be raging around them.\n\nThere's no question that Leone created a different filmic genre by melding the hysterically overdone Italo grand opera with Spanish picaresque convention. A Spanish term, Picaro means \"rogue\" or \"rascal\", and the picaresque yarn is usually sardonic, featuring the misadventures of roguish protagonists of low stature who live by their wits in a crooked world, and told with realistic and humorous detail. Here 'Blondie' (Eastwood) and Tuco (Wallach) are the two picaros, who have stumbled upon a way to make good money claiming bounty rewards for Tuco's many sins.\n\nSomeone criticized the film on the grounds that the geography doesn't look anything like the actual landscapes where these Civil War events occurred. Wrong. The events in the film take place in extreme West Texas and the New Mexican Territory. \"Santa Fe\" is even mentioned a couple of times. When Angel Eyes meets Baker, his employer, near the beginning it's in El Paso, which is 250 miles south of Santa Fe. The topography of Almer\u00eda, Spain, is an acceptable geographical substitute.\n\nAdmittedly this Spaghetti Western is overrated, overlong and has some slow stretches, not to mention amoral & one-dimensional characters and a story that idolizes lucre above everything; it also has campy and goofy elements, which kills any realism. But, if you can handle all that, Eastwood is the coolest Westerner, Lee Van Cleef is the ultimate bad axx, the exceptional score by Ennio Morricone is iconic and the film pulsates with hip style (for 1966, that is). In short, there's some good in this movie, even greatness, which explains the ridiculous gushing of some reviewers; but, let's be honest, there's also some bad and ugly.\n\nDirector Leone strained to explain the theme: \"We all have some bad in us, some ugliness, some good. And there are people who appear to be ugly, but when we get to know them better, we realize that they are more worthy.\" One reviewer took this and claimed that each of the three protagonists embody the three parts of human nature with Tuco representing the id (i.e. the \"flesh\") and Blondie representing the ego (i.e. the mind with its power of volition). Okay, that fits. But then he tried to argue that Angel Eyes (Van Cleef) represents the superego, which goes to show that he didn't understand this structural model of the psyche seeing as how the superego is the idealistic, heroic side of human nature (aka the \"spirit\") and Angel Eyes in the movie is anything BUT.\n\nThe film runs 163 minutes (the version I viewed) and was shot in Burgos, Granada, Almer\u00eda & Colmenar Viejo, Spain, with interiors done in Rome. The screenplay was written by Leone & Luciano Vincenzoni with the additions of Agenore Incrocci & Furio Scarpelli.\n\nGRADE: B-"

        "review_detailed_main": "Alas. Allow me to surmise a bit of history: having created two of the greatest westerns ever with \"A Fistful of Dollars\" and \"For A Few Dollars More\", some unscrupulous soul was able to convince Sergio Leone that he was a creator of great cinema, instead of a creator of great westerns; this movie was the result. Gone are the brilliantly set-up action sequences, replaced with senseless and dull confrontations, with size, not even quantity, trying to make up for the lost quality. Gone are the witty and interesting characters and the deep character development, replaced with annoying, inconsistent, and flat caricatures. As to just what Leone was trying to say with this movie, for clearly he felt it had a message, it is either horribly unclear or completely and pathetically trite. In his quest to make a movie with meaning, Leone cast aside what had made this movie's \"predecessors\" so wonderful, and found that not only did he lose the bird in his hand, but he couldn't catch the ones in the bush and fell in a pile of excrement in trying."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a huge fan of old spaghetti western films, and there is no one who does them better than the likes of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood. These two men despite have a language barrier were able to create several amazing westerns that have set the golden standard for macaroni westerns.\n\nI want to start with Casting... Clint Eastwood is a bad ass, there simply is no denying it. He is the Badass cowboy that will steal your girl and in the same instant earn your respect, and I have nothing other to say than he was born to play the role of Blondie. Now he also had a great lineup of supporting actors who helped him gain such acclaim but they just don't hold a candle to Mrs. Eastwood.\n\nThere is also the plot which is a like a headphones cord that is so tangled that the audience is forced to watch as Sergio Leone slowly untangles each separate knot, giving the appearance of separate stories but inevitably straightening to reveal that it is intact a single line. Now it may not be a complicated nonlinear story with loads of flashbacks but Sergio Leone proves himself a true filmmaker by unraveling a story rather the simple telling the audience the events that take place.\n\nFinally I want to touch on the score. This to me is where the movie really shines, because despite all the cowboy reality it is the score that connects the story together. Building tension with every whistle and drumlins, changing the simple shots into something meaningful. It is not an understatement when I say that this score is the single most iconic score of all time.\n\nI am giving this movie a 9/10 because this to me is more than just cinema, it is emotions caught on 2.35:1. (My favorite cinematic aspect ratio)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie for the first time on my tiny 15 inch screen of my TV/DVD player, and even on this minuscule format I was still simply amazed by the sheer scope of it. Now I understand and acknowledge the usual complaints against the film, namely the fact that the movie is almost three hours long with many scenes that tend to drag on for minutes with little dialog or action, however it is these scenes that make the movie the masterpiece that it is. Every shot whether it be an expansive landscape or an extreme close-up Sergio Leone draws you into his own version of the old west. A world where three men chase each other across the desert in search of 100,000 dollars worth of Confederate gold. Along the way they encounter Yankee and Confederate soldiers, Mexican bandits, bounty hunters in a journey that culminates in one of the most riveting showdowns in cinema history. What I found most interesting about this film however was the influence it obviously had on modern filmmaker Quentin Tarentino. Many of his trademarks (very memorable characters, long shots centered on a single character, intense standoffs involving multiple characters) can be found in abundance in this film as well. In fact Tarentino's Kun Fu epic Kill Bill goes so far as to barrow multiple songs from Leone's Dollars Trilogy. In the end all this adds up to make The Good the Bad and the Ugly in my opinion one of the greatest films of all time."

One point the director portrays in this film, is how gritty the west was, and how cruel the world is when the wicked play on their terms. Worth seeing."
