        "review_detailed_main": "The film is pretty straight forward. Not well written. And much of the acting is pretty bad. The better actors are the top billed: Nick Cage and the guy from One Tree Hill. Many of the actors on the plane were terrible. The blonde flight attendant wasn't bad although she seems to be kinda unknown. Jordan Sparks should stick to singing.\n\nWith all that being said, this is a niche film for a certain audience (Christians). I'm not sure why atheists and agnostics would watch it and then be totally annoyed or angered by it because of its Christian themes. The film is about the Christian Rapture. And I'm sure most people knew that before watching.\n\nThe problem with 90% of the reviews here are that they are biased. Their reviews aren't based on how bad the film is, but instead on their disagreement with the religious ideology behind the film, and their rejection of Christianity. In other words, they're reviewing Christianity instead of the film. But in terms of quality, this film is on par with Sharknado. And this does not deserve the title of Nick Cage's worst film. That prestigious distinction still goes to The Wicker Man."

        "review_detailed_main": "**Spoilers**\n\nNow obviously everyone has reviewed this saying how terrible it is. So I thought I would start picking holes in the aviation side of things. In no particular order (and ones i can remember)\n\n1. Captain leaving the flight deck without really talking to the F/O, no handover of control.\n\n2. Captain returns to the flight deck using emergency flight deck access code. This does not unlock the door immediately.\n\n3. Why is the aircraft in an unusual attitude? At that altitude the aircraft would be on autopilot, not manual flight. So without either pilot on the flightdeck it would continue straight and level and the current speed until the fuel ran out.\n\n4. Non-Standard unusual attitude recovery (disregarding the fact it wouldn't get into one)\n\n5. TCAS with the other aircraft. Capt failed to follow the TCAS resolution advisory which would have guaranteed minimum separation between the 2 aircraft.\n\n6. With that substitutional damage on the aircraft wing there would be an incredible amount of airframe vibration.\n\n7. wing was damaged, why does he lose elevator control?\n\n8. At point of divert JFK would not be the best airport to divert too. The great circle route between JFK and London would take you up the coast of Canada then passing just south of greenland. Most likely airport which could take an aircraft at that size would likely be Gander or similar.\n\n9. Changing aircraft type throughout the film.\n\n10. A lot of none-standard Radio Transmissions 10.1 using names on RT 10.2 Maydays are initiated by saying mayday 3 times 10.3 after declaring a mayday your normal callsign is preceded by mayday 10.4 all radio communication involves your callsign to identify who is talking and who you are talking too. 10.5 all attempts to contact were on VHF radio, no attempt made on HF? 10.6 while trying to make mayday he was selected on 121.9 (not a standard oceanic frequency) and while changing the dial he never actually made it active frequency so was always transmitting on 121.9 10.7 if you failed to contact anyone on a atc frequency a pilot would likely try 121.5 (guard) or 123.45 (aircraft to aircraft)\n\n11. Failure of flight controls would make the autopilot unusable. However he seems to continue using it (though seemingly from other parts of the film there is no continuity regarding the autopilot)\n\n12. Fuel situation, at the start of the flight the Capt says it will be a 6.5 hour flight, taking into account reserves and alternate fuel it is likely to be a conservative fuel for about 8.5-9 hours. However, he has a major fuel leak at the 3 hour mark which would probably cost him more than any reserves he had yet they somehow manage to fly 3 hours return back to JFK.\n\n13. Sat phone problem (not strictly aviation but bear with me). Continually failing to contact on sat phone is a problem, but there is another service provided by Stockholm radio (HF, so would work in the middle of the Atlantic) which allows you to call a any phone in the world.\n\n14. Ups the cabin altitude to force people to put on masks, this is possible but wouldn't happen as quickly as shown.\n\n15.claims to be flying a 400 tonne aircraft. seems very heavy for aircraft shown in the film. (for reference, Max Takeof weights for A330: 242 tonnes: B757 255 tonnes: B777: 380 tonnes)\n\n16. landing a \"400 tonne\" aircraft without flaps, spoilers, etc. is not possible, would be looking at at least 2-3miles minimum\n\n17. Wing magically repairs itself\n\n18. with no engines you would have no hydraulic pressure, would have to be a manual gear extension which he didn't do\n\n19. wouldn't be able to lift the wing again once on the ground. it wouldn't provide enough lifting moment\n\n20. evacuating the pane. as soon the door opened the slide would inflate. wouldn't have to push it out afterwards.\n\n21. aircraft evacuation slides are very hard and don't give you any bounce as demonstrated when the guy was kicked off the plane.\n\n22. very low quota of cabin crew for the size of the aircraft. rule is 1 per 50 passengers minimum.\n\n23. when evacuation is undertaken, general rule is get away from the aircraft. not mill about near the burning wreckage.\n\nOverall this film was terrible. I am sure i missed a few holes in the aviation side too but this made it slightly more amusing for me while watching.\n\nSource of knowledge about the holes in the aviation parts, I am a commercial Pilot."

The acting was terrible, the script was horrendous, seriously. A group of high school kids in drama club could do better. It was deathly boring, i thought I was in there for more than three hours.\n\nWorst of all is the message its trying to send. Isn't it curious that the movie tried so hard to portray all of those that were left as bad messed up people? So is that supposed to mean that those who don't believe in the Christian God are all either cheaters, flirts, gamblers, thieves, drug addicts and just generally messed up? Because that's what I saw. Don't think I wouldn't catch that. I get that its a Christian movie but its still a pretty offensive way of showing off your faith.\n\nEven in the Philippines, which is predominantly made up of believers, people in the theatre couldn't help but laugh at how absolutely ridiculous everything was.

        "review_detailed_main": "Once again I was deceived by the trailers as they made this movie look absolutely amazing; however, the trailers were the only good things that came out of this movie, and that says a lot.\n\nFirst of all, we have the common Christian movie stereotype where some of a family is for God, and some of it is against God. Than we are provided with the frequent misunderstandings non-Christians face regarding the meaning of scripture due to Christians who have almost 0 theological education. So because the Christians fail to provide an adequate answer, the non-Christian lashes out. At least provide the audience with some level of complexity if you're going to have some kind of a theological debate. Your audience understands more than you think. Now if we could simply ignore the horrendous script not to mention the awful acting, we still have a movie full of stereotypes regarding non-Christians, Christians, Muslisms and even smaller people (just trying to be politically correct) which got old very fast.\n\nBut believe it or not, this is not even the worst part of the movie! The worst part is the terrible background music! To put it bluntly, it was GARBAGE!! It was so floaty and totally ruined the atmosphere. Now don't get me wrong, some movies require floaty music, but it would have made more sense to have music that was thematically apocalyptic. For example, Armageddon, Independence Day, or World War Z each had excellent pieces which blend perfectly into the atmosphere of the movie. The fact is even if the script to a movie is mediocre, having an excellent soundtrack can drastically improve the atmosphere. With a corny 80's saxaphone piece playing in the background, or cheesy orchestral music, which sounded digital, my wife and I walked out of the movie going \"what did we just see?\"\n\nThough I am a pastor, I was hoping to be raptured during the movie. Do what I should have done and save your money by not seeing this film."

Religious bias is arrogantly displayed (but I'll leave that to the unfortunate viewer to spot). Complex ideas like forgiveness, atonement and judgement are reduced to idiocy at an atomic level. I apologise if this sounds too much like a rant but for someone who watches well over 15 films a week, I have never subjected myself to anything this offensive (to the senses) in over 25 years."

Cage did a creditable job, as did most of the cast. If you're looking for a reasonably good disaster movie (where God provides the disaster), this is not a bad time-waster.\n\nThe movie was almost universally panned by critics, but I'd bet the overwhelming majority of them are not only non-religious, but actively anti-religion. If this movie had been made in the 1950s or 60s, I suspect it would have done quite a bit better at the box office, along with the Charlton Heston and Victor Mature biblical epics."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Left Behind\" is about the Steele family. Mother Irene becomes very deeply religious and active in church in recent years. Unfortunately, this caused spirited daughter Chloe, as well as her pilot husband Ray, to drift apart from her. When Chloe comes home to surprise her father for his birthday, he was called to fly a plane from New York to London, among his other ulterior motives. That same day, a distressing event occurs where millions of people simultaneously suddenly disappear, leaving their clothes and things behind. Those people left behind scramble to make sense of what happens, as Ray struggles to land his damaged plane safely back to New York.\n\nAcademy Award winner Nicholas Cage once again majorly disappoints with his hammy and florid performance in this film as Ray here. He had a moment in the end where some genuine emotion came through, but it felt too late and too brief. It was good to see '80s sweetheart Lea Thompson back on the big screen again as Irene, but she was barely there. Cassi Thompson did her best to carry the film on the ground as Chloe, but her efforts were negated by the lines she was made to say and the stunts she was made to do.\n\nWhen the passengers were boarding the plane, I felt like I was watching a cheesy episode of the \"Love Boat\". Of course, there was going to be a sexy and flirtatious stewardess Hattie (Nicki Whelan). There was a hotshot TV journalist Buck Williams (so this is what Chad Michael Murray is up to nowadays), a Moslem guy, an angry midget guy, a sleazy businessman, a nerdy Asian (!) conspiracy theorist, a nervous drug addict lady, an even more nervous gun-toting mother (Why did you accept this role, Jordin Sparks?). I guess you can see the chaotic over-the-top acting circus.\n\nIn fact, this whole film had an 70s-80s TV movie look and feel about it. Even the opening credits looked from that era. If \"The Remaining\" had a horror approach to depicting the Rapture, \"Left Behind\" played like a bad B-action film, down to its fiery, explosive, down-the-wire, narrow- escape type finale.\n\nThe Christian agenda was obvious from the start, and I did not mind that. In fact, I was looking forward to seeing how they would tie it into the story. However, even as a Christian film, I felt this film did not do its job well at all. Oddly, it made Christians appear unnaturally nutty or weird. Worst of all, its evangelical message was lost in the confusion and the cheese. 2/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Nicolas Cage made himself a household name in the 90s and early 2000s with various action roles and dramatic roles. This actor has started in some memorable roles that have drove him into the cinematic spotlight, but lately his filmography seems to have taken a downward slope, with a number of ill-fated roles. This apocalyptic thriller based on a best selling faith- based novel series by Jerry B. Jenkins is only another role to pull Cage deeper into his career trajectory. Directed by Vic Armstrong, this Christian thriller stars Nicolas Cage as Rayford Steele, an airplane pilot who is unexpectedly called into work on the day his daughter Chloe (played by Cassi Thomson) arrives home from college for his birthday, much to their disappointment. Chloe comes home to visit her religious mother (played by Lea Thompson) and little brother. After brushing off another one of her mother's religious testimonies, Chloe takes her little brother to the mall for a little brother-sister time. Suddenly within a blink of an eye, millions of people (including Chloe's brother) around the globe vanish leaving their clothes behind in an event known as The Rapture as described in the Bible. With the world plunged into darkness and chaos and Rayford's plane on low fuel, he, Chloe, and the remaining survivors fight to survive in the fateful event unknown to them.\n\nChristian dramas are often subject to poor reviews by critics, mainly for their lazy production value and acting, and having seemingly nothing on their agenda than to shove their religious messages down your throat. I personally don't have much of a problem with Christian dramas since I'm a believer myself, along as they are good. This one is the very opposite of good. And this all starts with the horrendous acting by just about everyone in the cast, especially Nicolas Cage who serves as the main star. None of them are remotely convincing in their roles, particularly in the scene when Cassi Thomson watches everyone around disappear within a flash (literally) and her reaction is awfully calm for someone who just witness a significantly mysterious event. The worse matters from the writing which often comes to be laughable and redundant. After the first twenty minutes, viewers spend over an hour with the characters trying to figure out the vaguely explained event that those (mostly Christians) already know happens, and the scenes never land. The only possible redeemable scene may come from Cassi Thomson's character speaking to a lonesome man at a Church who discusses about asking God for forgiveness of our sins, something mentioned in the bible multiple times. The rest of the film ponders through non-stop choppiness and even worse, it spends almost no effort on delivering its holy message. Instead, it focuses on the survival of these airplane passengers which quickly grows tiresome before the first hour.\n\nLeft Behind is thoroughly incompetent thriller with poor writing, poor acting, and an overall thin direction by Vic Armstrong. This film is completely soulless and empty in entertainment, even for those who are devote Christians, though those who enjoy religious themes may come to ignore the lazy production value. It is just sad to see an actor like Nicolas Cage in such a lifeless role, especially during this time in his career."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me first say that I am a Christian. I watch campy Christian movies solely for the sake to have some wholesome entertainment. I clearly remember the impact of reading the Left Behind book almost 16 years ago as a boy in middle school. Few other books have had such a profound impact on my life so I hold the entire series close to heart.\n\nHowever, I share all this to say that this movie is nothing but a hot mess. Here's a short list of sins. 1.) A soundtrack that sounds like bad elevator music 2.) Maybe it was just my theater but the dialogue was also difficult to hear 3.) Casually calm characters on the airplane after one of the most horrifying events known to mankind has just occurred 4.) Out of place comedic relief and 5.) So-so acting.\n\nTo be fair though, there were some improvements from the original movie. The rapture scene was markedly improved and actually made me gasp because it truly occurs unexpectedly. The action shots were also much better and the acting was improved but for the star power involved was rather weak. Many of the airplane scenes felt overly contrived with stilted acting.\n\nThe movie doesn't necessarily follow the plot of the Left Behind book as it's merely inspired by it but it doesn't matter with all the aforementioned problems. There's also a lot less preaching in this film than the original but frankly could have used more as to convey some message of inspiration.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Left Behind series I wouldn't say completely disregard this film but please don't have high expectations that this movie will deliver and improve on the original. I've waited 16 years for a movie to convey the fear, excitement, and triumph that enthralled me when I was an 11 year old boy staying up to the wee hours of the morning trying to read just one more page of the book. After watching this movie, it looks like I'll have to wait for another remake."

But I have to say the quality of the 2014 version feels like a modern film production that has paid attention to the details with special effects. The producers did a great job at casting and character development. Nicolas Cage has done a good job a portraying Rayford Steele.\n\nThis movie has inspired us to go back to the book series to read again. We can't wait to see the next movie in the series."

I scratch my head at how they could make this last 2 hours. And that Speed2-esque scene.... I'm sitting here with a frozen shot-eating grin on my face.\n\nI don't mind a flick with a religious theme, as it is can provide a fresh breath of air from a cinematographic space that is increasingly being filled with movies made from the usual overused trope elements. This one however could have been done a lot better. I do wonder who will cringe the most at this movie... the non-believers or the believers. I have a feeling it'll be the latter ones.\n\nVerdict: OK popcorn flick if you can stand the religious stuff. In any case you'll have a good laugh at it after-wards. (Or long-lasting chills up your spine). If the rel stuff is too much, you can justifiably consider this a laughable mess and do a -1 or -2.\n\n(Nicholas Cage will also have the chills up his spine from taking the lead role of this thing.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, full disclosure: I'm not a believer in the whole Rapture thing. Still, I'm willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of a movie. After all, I don't believe in hobbits, vampires, witches, The Force, etc, either. The truth is, though, I think I would hated this movie even *more* if I'd been a believer.\n\nLet's face it, The Rapture is the ultimate middle finger to nonbelievers; the final \"We told you so!\", so it's strange that the movie puts religion in the back seat. The couple of overtly Christian characters are mealy mouthed and annoying, and we're kind of relieved when they're gone. The other \"Christians\" are pretty covert. For example, a stewardess seems more than happy to gossip with another about the latter's upcoming sexual tryst, without the need to lecture her on her behavior. It's only later, when we find \"Bible Study\" in ridiculously large block letters in her (by then abandoned) calendar that we learn the truth. If she'd kept her schedule on an iPhone, we might never have known.\n\nBasically, the Rapture is just a vehicle for an action movie - a really, really lame action movie. The entire movie focuses on the fate of airline captain Rayford Steele and his plane, which I understand is just one part of the book. The central problem is that as long as one able-bodied pilot is left, The Rapture would really be more of an inconvenience than an emergency for a plane in flight. They get around this by throwing various obstacles in his path to build tension. These range from contrived to comically contrived, and in the end you've got something along the lines of an unfunny version of \"Airplane!\". I kept expecting Leslie Nielsen to come in and say \"We're all counting on you\".\n\nOf course, the biggest disappointment is Cage himself. Nicholas Cage is a talented actor who is famous for taking absolutely any role to pay down his enormous debts. Still, even in the worst movies, he usually fully commits to the part, and you at least get some campy fun. The godawful remake of \"Wicker Man\" comes immediately to mind as a good example. If ever there was an excuse for his trademark histrionics, this is it, but his just mumbles through his lines, with the look of embarrassment never entirely leaving his face. He really looks like a man who's seriously questioning the choices that have led him to this - not in the movie, but in his actual life.\n\nNot good, not \"so bad it's good\". Just a couple hours I'll never get back."

I'm surprised I got as far into it as I did, although after working for more than half a decade in a contact centre, my patience level is pretty high. The story is crap, the writing is crap, the acting is crap, and if this is the kind of crapola Nick Cage is taking on, he should retire forever. Lea Thompson could have made it the rest of her life on Lorraine McFly money without doing this piece of trash. I didn't pay anything other than my subscription to Netflix for this, but somehow I feel utterly raped of my time and actually feel slightly dumber than I was, and should be monetarily compensated for my loss.

The religious message is very heavy which may not be suitable for many people to a point where even an atheist would feel insulted. Storyline is also very boring and It is very predictable, i could predict the ending 10 minutes into the show. Seems like the director is using famous names like Nicholas Cage and Jodin Sparks to lure people into watching this movie. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it definitely got the message to the audience (Maybe too strong of a message). Nicholas Cage really should stop taking bad shows like this under his name. Furthermore the CGI of the show is on par with an indie movie.This movie should not be on big screen."

The story line is merely VERY loosely inspired by the book.\n\nThat would be fine if the departure was well executed, but that is not the case here. I took a friend after having really talked up the movie to him. I ended up being very embarrassed that I dragged him to something that was so poorly executed. The film had one great special effects moment with the characters Chloe and Ramie, and that was the high point of the whole movie. The dialog, acting, sound, camera angles - it's actually hard to find something good to say.\n\nI am a Christian. There is nothing that would thrill me more than to see more Christian movies produced. What stops that from happening is the release of poor quality productions such as this. It gives the secular world yet another reason to categorize all Christian movies as bad.\n\nThis could have been epic. Why, oh why did they so completely miss the boat?"

I would rate this movie a 7/10 because it had all around solid acting, some funny parts, a moral message, and entertained me. Sure there are some parts that are a bit cheesy, but that's to expect in a Nicolas Cage movie. The plot is basically out of nowhere, the \"rapture\" occurs and God takes those up to Heaven that he feels need to go. I personally thought it was quite interesting, but not astounding. Anyone could watch this movie if they so desire, for there are few-to-none swear words, and a small smidgen of blood. Overall I'd recommend this movie if you are just looking for a overall solid movie."

I didn't really have an issue with the premise since I knew what it was about and nobody tricked me into seeing it. What I do have issues with is the lack of quality on this thing from top to bottom. The writing and directing are among the worst I've ever seen in a movie with an eight-figure budget. The special effects are very unimpressive; about what you might expect from a made-for-TV movie, not a theatrical release. The worst part of the whole thing is the acting. Every single actor in this is terrible. I've come to expect a certain degree of terrible from Nic Cage but he really takes it to another level here. A lot of the younger actors I'm barely familiar with but, after seeing them here, I will make sure to avoid anything they're attached to in the future. Probably the saddest part for me was seeing Lea Thompson in this. Why, Lea? Is this a religious thing I'm not aware of or what? You are better than this dreck. We're ALL better than this!"

The acting is so bad at some points I even find myself laughing. The script is flat and the movie takes way too long to build up. Now I'm not a believer but I usually don't mind movies with a religious theme at least not as long as they're GOOD and actually brings something more but this movie did not. I'm not ashamed to say I actually got of the couch and the others, still hoping it might get better, were left behind(see what I did there, that's the only joke I can make from this movie, seriously). I officially gave up, have never done that before, I can usually find something that is at least a little bit interesting to keep me through even the worst of movies, may it be a characters personality or just a really good looking actor but this movie didn't even bring that, not that there weren't some people I wouldn't mind looking at for a bit more but I just couldn't take it anymore. The best part about the movie is that I didn't pay for it.(Thank God for rental(yes i did manage a second, awful joke, I'm gonna stop I promise)). Already a few minutes in I could see the clich\u00e9 ending, no twists, no turns and as the world went wild when people disappeared I realized I was right and just gave up.\n\nSo please, no matter your reason to consider this movie, put it back! Put it back in whatever awful little box you found it in and let it be left behind(sorry). Leave it, forget it and don't ever go back to it. Not even if you're Christian. I'm serious, it's not worth it."

Whether he was a burnt out alcoholic in Vegas, or a chemical weapons expert sent into a disused prison to take on terrorist ex soldiers, he was still great fun to watch and a guaranteed draw at the Box Office.\n\nWhere did it all go wrong for Nicholas Cage? It seemed that, despite being popular with the fans, he seemed to give up on the cinema and be banished to straight-to-DVD releases. I've forgotten how many times I've been browsing 'New Release' films online and come across one of Cage's film that I'd never heard of. Our of my love for his nineties work, I watch it faithfully. Then I wish I hadn't. 'Left Behind' is one such film.\n\nCage plays a pilot who's flying his jumbo jet around the world when most of the world's population disappears. It's a sort of supernatural event, but it could also be looked upon like most of the world's population would rather inexplicably disappear than star in such a film.\n\nThose 'left behind' are all pretty unlikeable sorts, none of which you'll really care about. Much of my viewing time was spent wondering which shade of 'dark' Cage has started dying his hair.\n\nWithout wishing to give away too much about the plot, I've looked at various internet message boards about this film and found that it has stirred up some online debate between those who believe in a \u2013primarily Christian \u2013 God and those who generally don't believe in anything. Personally, I don't find anything wrong with a film which is based on religious principals. You don't need to 'believe' to like the film, although I find it hard to believe that anyone \u2013 religious or otherwise \u2013 will find anything particularly entertaining about this film.\n\nIt's just poor. There's little to say about this, other than to avoid it. If you like Cage (and many of us still do), watch one of his old films. If you like supernatural films then you probably own plenty which are a million times better than this. It will only ever be remembered as \u2013 yet another \u2013 of Cage's misfires. But, just because I may not have faith in this film, I still have faith that he'll one day star in a great film which will remind us of what he's capable of. I wonder if Stallone can get him on board for the Expendables 4? It might be a stepping stone to re-launch his career."

        "review_detailed_main": "Released in 2014, \"Left Behind\" stars Nicolas Cage as an adulterous airplane pilot on a trans-Atlantic flight who has to save the remaining passengers after many of them mysteriously disappear; meanwhile his daughter back in New York (Cassi Thomson) struggles with the disappearance of her little brother and mother (Lea Thompson). Chad Michael Murray plays a famous reporter on the plane while Nicky Whelan plays a sexpot flight attendant.\n\nThis is sort-of a theatrical version of the 2000 direct-to-video movie of the same name. I say \"sort of\" because it's a severely truncated rendition, which doesn't mean it's necessarily bad, but fans of the bestselling book will likely be disappointed by the smaller focus. It worked for me, however, and I'll explain why momentarily but, first, let's consider two other reasons for the critical feeding frenzy\u0085\n\nSome people might have been disappointed because they were expecting blockbuster quality when, in fact, the movie only cost $16 million. (The original cost $4 million, in case you were wondering). While $16 million is enough to make an okay theatrical release, it's not even close to the typical $100 million plus required to make a modern blockbuster disaster flick, like \"San Andreas.\" As such, the movie has a glorified TV-movie vibe, which film snobs zero-in on and lambaste.\n\nAnother big reason for the uber-negative reviews, of course, is the Christian-themed subject. Since the average person understandably finds the very idea of faithful believers being snatched away in the blink of an eye ludicrous they hold the movie in contempt. What I don't get is WHY such people would even be interested in viewing a movie like this when they know up front that it's based on a massively popular book with overt biblical themes.\n\nSo why did I like this movie? Because I was able to ignore the relatively low-budget production and get involved in the lives of the characters and their amazing story. I say \"amazing\" because how else would you describe a situation in which masses of people, including all children, suddenly vanish with only their clothing left behind? It would be an incredible experience, to say the least, not to mention a serious wake-up call for those who remain. The movie effectively reflects this. In short, this is a \"What if?\" movie. You don't have to believe in the Bible whatsoever to enter into the story of the characters and enjoy it for what it is \u2013 a \"What if the Rapture really happened\" movie. I don't believe in malevolent and wickedly ugly aliens with acid for blood, but that doesn't prevent me from liking the \"Aliens\" flicks.\n\nFurthermore, I appreciate the smaller focus of the story compared to the original movie. By doing this, it doesn't cut off more than it can chew. It focuses on one family and one airplane & its passengers and drives its point home without being awkwardly preachy. Lastly, Cage and Murray make for strong male protagonists while Thomson and Whelan are more than effective in the female department, including being extremely easy on the eyes.\n\nThe film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Provo, Utah.\n\nGRADE: B"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was excellent as in my opinion it is a satire on all the Christian dogma regarding the rapture and doomsday prophecies. I think most movie goers and critics missed this point. Did everyone notice how much emphasis was placed on the loss of the children? Did anyone notice how much pain and grief was expressed by the parents? Chloe is bereft when she loses her brother, and she makes a point of going to the hospital to check if all the babies are gone. The mother that she meets there is clearly in misery and agony. There is also scene in the street where the father is sitting with his head in his hands next to an empty stroller. Even the scene where the dog was sitting next to the children's toys showed even the dog's bewilderment. The character Shasta on the airplane is so grief stricken that she cannot handle the fact that no one is responsible for the disappearance of her child. Also, another woman in the general passenger section was also distraught over the loss of her children. This extreme loss and sorrow by the parents and families over the children was clearly emphasized in the movie.\n\nAgain, family is emphasized when the business man who was so consumed with money talks to the young woman about his own daughter. There was no mention of God in the scene ... just his own admission that he did not spend anytime with his own daughter. Great scene.\n\nThe final point made is this ... What kind of God is this that would snatch children away from parents and family members that deeply love and cherish their children? Nicolas Cage was excellent in performance as he was determined to see the remaining passengers to safety.\n\nThere was no profession of new found faith from any of the characters. In fact, Chloe reject the nonsense of the minister that she confronts in the church.\n\nSatire the use of irony, sarcasm, ridicule, or the like, in exposing, denouncing, or deriding vice, folly, etc."

Won't go into details...goose bumps!\n\nI have read several reviews that mention \"preachy\"? Well what did you expect from a movie that is based on Christian Theology?\n\nDid it have some \"Hollywood\" aspects to it, of course it is a Hollywood movie. Revealing dress and an emphasis on showing female shape as often as possible. That is what you get to draw a \"wide\" audience.\n\nThis is what I hope to be a first in a long line of movies that portray the books. It is just a set up for much more involved and intertwined relationships and hardship. Along with some portions that will need to have action packed parts.\n\nI say to those who produced the film:\n\nWe are ready for the next one!\n\nBravo on this one.\n\nOne of the Way"

In any event, as I watched it I realized how much many fundamentalist Christians -- those who can write a review here of this film as about \"something that is very exciting to Christian believers\" -- and ISIS have in common. ISIS apparently believes in dishing out heavenly ordained atrocities themselves, and by their actions acquire additional holiness. Rapture fantasists -- of course posturing innocence by claiming they will be only witnesses of a cataclysm that bears no wishful content on their part -- hope that their god will dish out those atrocities and through their belief in the Rapture they will acquire additional holiness, along with the aforesaid excitement. In both cases we confront a kind of sanctioned sadism that is simply repellent and thoroughly *unexciting,* dismaying. Rapture fantasists only disagree with ISIS about who should die and under what auspices. These thoughts sorta got in the way of appreciating anything else about the film.\n\nCompared to this stuff, other apocalyptic films, like Day After Tomorrow, seem downright upbeat. You can get your thrills from megadeaths, and then interpret the film as inspiring a change in social practices. Not so here."

I'd hoped there might at least be a sharknado type of fun to it. But it's in theater's, making real money. I have so many questions, of authors, of actors, of producers, of ticket-buyers.\n\nIf this isn't technically a \"review\", again, you'll have to forgive me.

I can understand that people who were expecting another \"Christian Outreach\" movie may be disappointed, because I don't think that this version of Left Behind was supposed to be that sort of movie. Likewise, people who are expecting a movie that is \"by the book\" may also be disappointed since this movie doesn't even cover half of the first book. So, best to leave your expectations at home and go watch the movie without them. Left Behind is definitely character driven rather than special effects driven, and although the special effects in this movie were good (but not great), I more enjoyed watching the characters meet and learn about each other and develop genuine relationships in the middle of a very intense and scary situation. I walked out of the theater looking forward to watching the next movie as the rest of the story unfolds and the character relationships deepen. Oh, and I liked Chad Michael Murphy in the role of Cameron \"Buck\" Williams. He played it quite believably well (no offense intended to Kirk Cameron!) and was my favorite. The only actor I didn't quite get into so much was Nicky Whelan. Although she's a good actress, she just didn't quite seem to me to be a good fit for the role of Hattie Durham. She was definitely not on the same level as Nicolas Cage (Ray Steele) and Cassi Thomson (Chloe Steele), who both did a much better job and were much more believable. I enjoyed them both very much."

He tells her he is piloting a plane to London and the two argue. While flying, passengers vanish into thin air and everyone wants answers. Back on Earth the same thing is happening all over and no one knows why. First thing I have to say is that I have never seen the Kirk Cameron movies or read the books so I can't compare this to those. Also many of you know how I feel about Nicholas Cage so that will play a role in this review. I do have to admit this wasn't his worst movie and he didn't bug me as usual in this, but that is probably because he wasn't in it all that much. As for the movie itself, it was very cheesy and had the same aspects that most faith based movies do that bother me so much about them. When the rapture happens those that are believers will get called to heaven. After the good disappear it instantly becomes a free for all. Parents see their children vanish before their eyes and their first instinct is to start looting and take TV's and rob everyone they can. Movies like this have an unrealistic view of \"non- believers\" and that is why I am not a big fan of these faith based movies. Overall, all that said though this wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I'm not sure how fans of the original or the book series will like it though. I give it a C."

I'm struggling to understand how Cage ever got involved with this, it's not as if he needs the money(unless the subscriptions to Scientology have drastically increased). Painfully slow beginning, what was the point of the dreadful background music which seemed to accompany every scene? It meandered through the middle without ever really revealing any meaning as to what was occurring down on the surface. The end,when it finally came,was by far the best part of the movie as it took us to the credits,which were more interesting than the plot. Avoid like the plague - you have been warned."

Oh the gullible, gullible Lot. I watched this fantasy movie out of boredom, and it is truly stomach churning as expected.\n\nAlthough the movie was made in 2014, that's 2014, not 1914, so jets do have auto pilot which is engaged in flight. Just one in a long list of mistakes just to scare the christians.\n\nVery bigoted also to show that Christians were taken by the rapture, but muslims, who are also very religious, were not. \"Christians or no one\"; Jerks to incite bigotry. Typical christians - that's inciting hate.\n\nJust about every scene is geared around fear mongering. Right down to their sky fairy taking a husband, but leaving his wife behind unprotected - an elderly woman with dementia. A tiny baby taken from her mother - all tactics to scare people into joining their religion. It's appalling. Christians are disgusting to play upon vulnerable minds. I don't believe in gods, but I do know that this type of nonsense is not in the original bible. All of this is BS that men came up with in the last 150 years to create fear."

This movie was made on the very same topic as The Battle Hymn of the Republic. They both relate to the \"coming of the Lord\". The United Methodist Church (hardly radical) puts the Battle Hymn in the hymnal section entitled: \"A New Heaven and a New Earth, Return and Reign of the Lord\"\n\nWikepedia, hardly a proponent of Christianity, says of the Battle Hymn of the Republic: \"The song links the judgment of the wicked at the end of time (New Testament, Rev. 19) with the American Civil War \"\n\nSo it turns out all you people who wrote nasty, atheistic remarks in this board have been singing a song about Jesus and his return. Did you believe what you were singing you did just not pay any attention to what was coming out of your mouth? All of the lines in the first verse are from Revelation. You can, as they say, look it up. Go ahead, open the Bible and see. It won't hurt you. Get ready so you aren't trampled out as vintage of the grapes of God's wrath!\n\nBy the way, this also proves there is no separation of church and state, because the Battle Hymn is regularly sung at state occasions and by the United States armed forces. No one will ever try, or be able to, get this hymn made secular, or changed in any way or stopped because the fact is, there is no separation of church and state. Instead there is freedom to think, say and sing whatever we want."

Besides, I tend to enjoy such apocalyptic fiction, and even Nicolas Cage starring in some Evangelical hooey involving planes won't turn me away. I like \"Knowing\" (2009), after all. But, \"Left Behind\" is absolutely dreadful. Every scene is agonizingly contrived and ridden with clich\u00e9s to push its simplistic religious agenda. There are sinners, and there are saints, and all either any of them do is talk about God. The substandard CGI for the plane stuff is far more realistic compared to just about every conversation in the movie. Additionally, the pacing feels like Purgatory, while the overall experience is like Hell.\n\nThe doubled irony of \"Left Behind\" is that its cockeyed moralizing is undermined by focusing on the here and now instead of the hereafter and on the ultimate heroism and good naturedness of the irreligious, whereas the faithful, albeit perhaps inadvertently, get people killed and put many more in danger because of their faith. The true miracle here is that for a movie that's all about religious division, it seems to have brought many of varying beliefs together in denouncing \"Left Behind.\""

All of you \"complainers\" knew what it was going to be about before watching it, so how could you possibly be offended by its Christian content? (If you put your hand in a fire you WILL get burned!)\n\nBased on the reviews here, I decided to watch this movie expecting it to be terrible, but even with its flaws,I thought it was pretty darn good. It held my attention for its full duration, something that a bad movie cannot do, so I have no complaints. No, it wasn't any five-star block-buster, but just how many of those have been made in 2014? Two or three.... four, maybe?\n\nOn all the reviews, on all the movies including this one, I have to question what so many people expect from a movie. A movie is a MOVIE! It's not supposed to be \"accurate\" in every way unless it's labeled as a documentary. It's supposed to be entertaining, which most of them are, and that includes even the ridiculous ones if you'll just watch them instead of picking them apart.\n\nI watch all types of movies excluding musicals. I simply cannot stand musicals, so I could gain exactly nothing by watching one, and my biased review of it would be totally worthless to anyone. (I hope you understand what I'm saying.)\n\nNote that I registered here for the sole purpose of commenting on this movie in response to all the negative reviews. I highly recommend it to those who like science fiction, those who watch movies for for entertainment, and those who have an open mind. I do NOT recommend it to atheists, Muslims nor anyone else who is offended by Christianity, including the Word of our Christian God, as I see that is the only reason for 99.9% of those negative reviews."

A film so devastating, in fact genuinely unbearable in its overwhelming awfulness you question your faith in movies. How was $16 million allocated to this? Most of it most likely went to Nicholas Cage. Nicholas Cage is a good actor, but he needs to fire his agent. It's worse than usual here. Rather than doing one of his famous maniacal performances, he phones it in and nearly puts you to sleep. The plot isn't even paper thin: People disappear and it's something to do with religion. This is supposed to be a Christian movie, but it really isn't. The religious aspects are poorly handled and the religious characters are all presented as crazy and delusional. The only good thing that can be said about this mind blowing awful plane wreck of a movie is that the finale is admittedly tense and there's finally some sort of emotional investment in what should have been Direct to DVD. Sadly, just when you think it's finally over, they set it up for a sequel. Cue face palming.\n\nThe direction is utterly terrible and boasts no artistic merit of imagination. The acting is painful to watch and is so bad it feels like parody. It's not even unintentionally hilarious. There's little to no plot, the screenplay is painfully underwritten and lacks anything to actually attract the audience's attention. It's a terrible movie. I've run out of ways to further hammer home that point. Just don't watch it no matter what you do. Why should people waste their time on this? Even if you aren't spared from this highly unpleasant trip down the cinematic toilet bowl, don't watch the planned sequels. They'll most likely be just as awful. This is a total disaster of Roland Emmerich proportions and there are simply no benefits to seeing it. Well, you'll know how Gollum felt after having his soul destroyed for 500 years by the Ring of Power but that's hardly an achievement is it? Just awful.\n\n1/10"

There is no mass Get born again message to this movie just a a look into a few peoples experience of being Left Behind. Is this a film with an exorbitant budget? No, However it is is well acted by most of the cast! Our entire theater applauded at it's end so I must not have been the only one who really enjoyed it!!!!!!!!!!! Just a side note: What would you talk about and how would you react if this happened today! The prayer vigils that are held after tragedies like 9/11 or school shootings tell me that many who don't necessarily believe in God or going church would be looking and turning to God for an explanation as most have herd of the Rapture at one point in their lives and and event like this would probably bring the world to their knees!!! However if you would answer no to this question then this is probably not a movie for you!"

Otherwise this is absolutely nothing like them. You will get no nostalgia, it will just make you mad.\n\nIf you watch it to see Nic Cage you will be disappointed as he isn't there. Yes, he is technically in the film, but from the get-go it's obvious he's not really there. His screen time is minimal considering he plays the main character, & when he is on screen his delivery is flat and heartless. It's clear he was thinking about anything other than this movie while being in the movie.\n\nIf you watch because you want to see a quality film you won't be disappointed as much as outraged. I doubt I can articulate it as cleverly & hilariously as many of the other reviewers here, but suffice it to say that every possible aspect of the movie is awful: the dialogue, acting, weird & random camera work, the music, the plot, etc. Chloe's storyline is literally just her wandering through town in different spots being upset (the mall, walking down the sidewalk, in a hospital to look at babies, at church, & finally on top of a bridge). The movie supposedly had a $16 million budget. I don't understand how that's mathematically possible considering the final product is worse than a low-budget Lifetime movie.\n\nIf you're watching because you're a believer in Christ & you want some encouragement you will be disappointed. As corny as the old books & movies were you could at very least read/watch them & hear the Gospel presented. There is no Gospel presence in this movie whatsoever, & unless I missed it the name of Jesus was not mentioned one time in almost 2 hours, quite a feat considering this was an adaptation of a Christian book series.\n\nEven if you watch this to laugh ironically at how bad this is you'll be disappointed, it's not entertaining even in that sense."

That plot element is the only thing original about Knowing, but the only originality this movie didn't leave behind was a question of how a short man drives a car. That joke is a diamond the size of a pumpkin seed. And a seed in the Grand Canyon at that. The worst part is that two thirds of the canyon are full of skunk excrement, instead of any story or pace whatsoever!!!\n\nThat's how Left Behind must be looked at if the good lord will allow you into heaven."

Nicolas cage is and always will be a great actor and i found him yet again playing a role very well. I love his calmness in his roles and intensity.

He's thinking about what he's having for dinner that night or that suit he has to pick up from the dry cleaners on the way home. He has a look in his eyes like he's waiting for the Cohen Brothers or Scorsese to come and rescue him and his career. The movie is nearly 2 hours long and you will feel it, they are a long 2 hours. Everyone acts poorly and looks confused, the special effects are on the same level as a cheap TV movie from the 90's, the story is absurd, the characters do the dumbest things and the religious overtones are so childishly bias that i imagine even Christians who usually enjoy this crap would be offended.

As it's based on 'GOD' and 'END OF THE WORLD', i can see why some people didn't like it as they wouldn't take it as a possibility or just hate the thought of it or they just don't believe in those sort of things but why go watch a movie based around the events of the world ending if they're not fond of it?\n\nOverall i think this movie good and pulled me in to the story as i was watching it, yes the movie could have been better as with any movie which is made. Everyone ripping Nicolas Cage off for this movie and saying he did the worst job but i don't think i can imagine anyone else in his role, reminded me of his role in 'Knowing'.\n\nIf you don't like movies based on religion, god, end of the world, then don't bother with this movie. This is NOT the worst movie of 2014, I've watched something far more terrible this year which tried to put me to sleep, it was 'The Hunger Games:Mocking Jay- Part 1' which was just made to take people's money. Don't Believe me, go watch it!!"

Maybe that's because he is an actor with a repertoire of truly compelling, cohesive (seamless) and coherent movies. To now be seen in a movie where the opening dialog between the daughter of his character in the movie and the celebrity photo journalist were embarrassing to the extent that I actually went past that bit when I got home to continue watching the movie. Then, I had to go back and watch it again anyway for reference. It didn't sound as badly as it did the first time but the point was the shock of even having any issue with the dialog in a movie he was in \u2013 people like us choose our movies using actors, directors and studios, not genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "Instead of letting his wife convulse in skimpy outfits onstage to convince people into embracing Christianity, the pastor in question could have used the funds to make a movie on hindsight like what Stoney Lake Entertainment has done here.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Stoney Lake Entertainment is set up to produce faith-inspired films for the masses and their intention is to create a franchise for Left Behind which in turn is based on a series of popular books by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye. This is not the first time Left Behind is being made into a movie however, in actual fact it was originally done in the year 2000 and followed by two other sequels.\n\nLake's CEO Paul Lalonde co-wrote this remake that involved the biblical Rapture where faithful believers are taken up to heaven before the apocalyptic end of days. The narrative begins with the Steele family at the JFK airport. Father Ray Steele (Nicolas Cage) is an airline pilot who is struggling to keep both his marriage and children together while beginning an affair with a sultry air stewardess. His daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) is upset by his father's absence and she also has problems understanding issues of God especially with her religiously inclined mother.\n\nWithin seconds of the opening credits, we are treated to a shot of a book called \"Acts of God\" and seconds later, a woman begins rambling about the end of the world to a supposedly famous TV reporter, Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray). There isn't much subtlety to talk about and the frequent hackneyed writing and wooden performances worsen the viewing experience further.\n\nThe touted Rapture happens about an hour later. On the flight where Ray is piloting to London, dozens of passengers and all the children onboard just vanished, leaving behind fear and lots of head scratching. On the ground, the same strange occurrence happened. Chloe's younger brother mysteriously vanishes at the mall leaving behind his belongings. Petty crimes, looting and robberies starts happening everywhere. It is the end of the world people, so everyone just has the urge to commit crimes. That makes a lot of sense.\n\nBecause this is a character driven drama with good religious intentions, we are treated to more subplots and stock characters on the plane. For example, the obligatory Muslim passenger (who might be a terrorist), an annoying little man, a black woman who pulls out a gun out of nowhere, and a rich business man who suddenly develops concern for his estranged daughter; meanwhile, Chloe is playing Supergirl helping Daddy land his huge malfunctioning plane on a deserted highway. No worries though, Daddy has a helping hand as co- pilot- the handsome and attractive Chuck.\n\nTechnically, this US$16 million production is often hampered by poor visual effects, sloppy editing and laughingly, a weird 1980s look to the entire flick. The usually entertaining Nicolas Cage with his batshit crazy acting turns up pretty somber and underwhelming. Left Behind is a heavy-handed, preachy movie disguised as an apocalyptic action thriller. Even veteran stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong who helmed this project couldn't make this any better. This movie is best left for believers while the rest might prefer to sign up for bible study for a start."

Suffice to say, my soul is as \"Dirrty\" as Christina Aguilera. But my biggest sin is one I've committed recently. In fact, to be specific, last night. I bravely watched Left Behind. A piece of Christian propaganda where the world experiences a biblical rapture and everyone is running around losing their \"God damn honey!\". And, without coming across as insensitive, oh my God it's worse than attending Sunday Service!\n\nSensationalist propaganda that ham-fists Christian revelatory views upon its audience with atrocious acting, inexcusable writing and misplaced direction. Cage is a pilot. \"See my badge?\". And he doesn't care. Because when the screenplay insists on having a couple of delusional characters preach Christian teachings at every possible opportunity, that's what God wanted apparently, I don't blame him. This rapturous apocalypse drives everyone crazy. Civilians purposefully stealing things to highlight how sinful they are. Even driving our protagonist to attempt suicide. The world is manic, and it's \"God's\" fault. But it's fine. Honestly! Armstrong depicts our beloved deity as a beacon of generosity. What he/she/it/I don't care has bestowed upon this persecuted land is a blessing. Because, y'know, we weren't Cher and we didn't \"Believe\" (auto-tune included...), so why do we deserve to be saved?\n\nUrgh, this got too deep for a review. Keeping it short and sweet, it's one of the worst films I've endured. All it took was the rapture to reunite a father and daughter, before tackling an apocalyptic world to which is \"only just the beginning\". So start believing in God, or else we're getting a sequel..."

Im not dogmatic about this because no matter what anyone thinks or believes it will go down the way it goes down inspite of anyone's view. I think Nicholas Cage is a good actor and have enjoyed some of his movies as well. I for sure am not into the LaHaye/LaLonde/ books and have never read any of them. The movie in my opinion was a dude. I thought the original one with Kirk Cameron was a better movie. Yes there were some pretty cool effects blah,blah,blah. But zero mention of the gospel. Zero! So why did the Christians disappear of the earth? That was never truly explained outside of. \"They believed\". What did they believe? Yes it shows the pastor who got left behind and when the young girl who was missing half her family asked why he was still there? He simply stated he preached yada,yada,yada but he didn't really believe. Again believe in what? Yes we are told the world is going to get really, really bad now. But why. Nicholas Cages acting was just not very convincing. I like the actor who played Buck (the original Kirk Cameron part) as well as the actress that played Chloe.For once Christianity Today got it right they state \"Christian magazine Christianity Today heavily criticized the film, saying, \"Left Behind is not a Christian Movie, whatever 'Christian Movie' could even possibly mean. In fact, most Christians within the world of the movie\u2014whether the street-preacher lady at the airport or Rayford Steele's wife\u2014are portrayed as insistent, crazy, delusional, or at the very least just really annoying. They want churches to book whole theaters and take their congregations, want it to be a Youth Group event, want magazines like this one to publish Discussion Questions at the end of their reviews\u2014want the system to churn churn away, all the while netting them cash, without ever having to have cared a shred about actual Christian belief. They want to trick you into caring about the movie. Don't. We tried to give the film zero stars, but our tech system won't allow it.\" Myself Im waiting for the Daniel Project movie to come out. Im sure it will be a better film."

The story starts in an airport where a daughter is returning home to visit a father, who is having a birthday, but has to work an only gets a brief exchange instead. Nicolas Cage plays the father -- who is a pilot and clearly has alterior motives for taking this flight as he intends to hookup with a young stewardess at their destination. The daughter then meets the other main character whom she takes a liking to, and then also boards Cage's characters' plane. Once in the air \u2013 a strange occurrence happens where some of the people disappear including the co-pilot leaving only their clothes behind them. We find out later that this same occurrence is happening throughout the world and is the cause of expected chaos in the air and on the ground. The acting and the representation of this event is believable and this is where the movie pulls off what could be a very silly plot. Cage's character later determines that believer's of Christ are those that are disappearing based on information he received from his wife --- who is a believer and has disappeared. For the most part this movie accomplishes it's task of being a thriller and an attempt at spiritual awakening. Cage is very good as he tries to put the pieces together to figure out what is going on. This 2nd version of the book does a much better job than the first although the ending seems unlikely and done for dramatic benefits. The movie completes itself, but also voices that this is \"just a beginning\" which could lead to sequels if it does well\u0085the authors have provided many stories if they want to do this, but we will see."

Not taking immediate action for collision, not turning back immediately, leaving the cockpit are just a few..

Common on Christian directors, script writers, etc. please, oh please start putting out something worth watching. If that means that Hollywood has to put their hands into it then so be it. But they don't want this. Then get ready for some really crappy films to come out in the name of Christ. I can't believe that they want to create a sequel for this film.

Well I could not believe it, the movie was very good\u0085 They could have made it great, but it was only good.. And in my opinion here is the reason. The movie was moving along just fine, typical science fiction movie , mixed with an airplane.. how could you go wrong.. well you add religion to the mix is how. Thats when it got kinda quirky.. Otherwise its a good movie and worth watching. I am going to stop listening to so many other reviews and follow my formula , good plot+good actor.. means possibly good movie."

However it commits the cardinal sin of being totally, overwhelmingly boring. Nothing happens to care about during the entire film, no redeeming terrible-ness.

It becomes clear about 3 quarters of they way through that the only thing that mattered to the director was getting the Bible Bashing message across and cods-wallop with the quality of the film -IT SUCKS BIG TIME , even worse it starts out giving you hope sitting there thinking 'hmmmm this looks OK' But its not.

Unfortunately, he misjudged this and Cage was as bad as the rest. Giving this movie a \"1\" is giving it more credit than it deserves, but you can't give something \"0\". Few movies can achieve such utter disaster, but Left Behind did it. Even fewer movies can provide justification for a movie goer to demand their money back. Left Behind did it.

Maybe these views are the results of cynics, atheists, personal transparency, people afraid of the truth, or watching the movie on a low quality screen. My friend who read the series of books the movie is based on also loved the movie.\n\nI didn't focus so much on the acting as the story line, but I did think Martin Klebba's antagonist remarks were hilarious. I thought Jordan Sparks did an amazing job. Chad Michael Murray is a hotty even though his super hero character is not all that believable. In the movie I laughed, I cried, I felt fear and I cheered. At the end of the movie, everyone (at least 50 people) in the theater stood up and clapped.\n\nI lived a life so far from both sides of the coin. As a child I could drink water from a stream in a forest not far from my home. We went Trick or Treating without chaperoned well into the night. At 13 years of age a single murder in Chicago made headline news. Politicians ran for office to improve our country not for self-indulgence and greed. Education was something I enjoyed and valued, not forced and a source of major stress for both student and educator. Animal abuse was not part of our vocabulary. We believed in our leaders and a future for our country. All this change has taken place in just shy of 60 years. A downward spiraling change at this rate of speed cannot sustain itself. The movie shows our world as it is today with greed, self-indulgence, theft, killing, selfishness. To me, this is a reality check. Maybe for others, this is just business as usual.\n\nGrowing up as a Catholic I am not well-versed in the Bible. After seeing the movie I joined a Church with an intense Bible Study group. I hope this movie will have an equal effect on others seeking the truth."

        "review_detailed_main": "To begin, I need to preface my review with this: I DO NOT believe in the pre-tribulation rapture theory. I believe in the mid-tribulation rapture, like the Bible actually speaks of. LEFT BEHIND, from the getgo, is founded on the idea that one day God will collect a bunch of people in Heaven, and everyone left on the planet is (sort of) screwed.\n\nThis film is a remake of the original film that starred Brad Johnson and Kirk Cameron. Whether this version is closer to the book or not is beyond me, for I own a copy but have not yet read it. The shocker in my viewing was that practically every bit of the film takes place on the plane where Buck Williams and Ray Steel are stranded after the rapture takes place and a ton of drama has begun to unfold due to the worry of people losing friends and family whom were also on the plane.\n\nI can't help but tell you immediately that this film is awful. The only things I actually find worthwhile about this movie are unintentionally comedic moments--many including the midget character that seems to hate everyone. The guy is like a live-action Grumpy Cat manifesto, and I absolutely adore any moment that he's shown on the screen for the sheer fact that he is hysterical (unintentionally, of course).\n\nThe acting here isn't even worth talking about. Seriously. There isn't even a flip-out moment with the star, Nicholas Cage, whom is notorious for being borderline psychotic in almost everything he's in. Nope. Nothing. Nada. Because he is playing a character whom wants to keep the people of the plane calm.\n\nAnd to mention the rapture itself, I now claim that the Chloe character is the Antichrist, due to the second she hugs her brother, he vanishes into thin air. I seriously couldn't hold it in; I laughed so loud at how goofball-ish that moment was that I actually received nasty looks from people whom probably thought I was simply there to make fun of the movie for being Christian. Tsk tsk; I'm on your team, nastylookers.\n\nThe CGI, in my opinion, looked solid in the trailers. After seeing the film, I can assure you that you're missing nothing because (a) the movie is very dull outside of its kind-of themes and sort-of touching moments (all of them seemingly taking place at the very end of the film), and (b) because the CGI that is actually used is horrendous. There's even a moment where Chloe is making a life-and-death situation out of herself and she climbs a bridge. You can literally see the greenscreen in bits through her hair. I'm not even kidding.\n\nWhen it comes to the music in LEFT BEHIND, I can promise you that none of it fits. Remember how the original trilogy barely had music, and when it it did, it was horrible modern Christian Rock? This film doesn't even get that much. It's essentially a collection of songs that sometimes resemble what I would expect from a Pixar film.\n\nI feel that anyone whom might be hoping this will be a so-bad-it's-good situation will be pleased, for the most part. However, anyone else looking for a fun Christian time might as well spend the money on that number they might have found scribbled with a knife into the bathroom stalls of their local barhouse. Because this is awful. This is unruly, to be frank.\n\nGod bless the Midget Man! I give LEFT BEHIND an F as a serious rating, but a C as a so-bad-it's-good rating.\n\nThanks for reading, friends, and God bless you all.\n\nAnd please don't fall into this pre-tribulation rapture lie."

BUT, I was reading some online info. regarding the movie and they said that the first Left Behind movies were definitely more religious and preached about the end times more. This movie was not meant to. It was meant to appeal to more people and get the non-Christians or even those that are 'on the fence' to go see the movie. If it was too 'preachy' they would never come. That made complete sense to me and now makes me like the movie even more. My hope is that millions of people will see this movie and make them think, make them talk, and hopefully get some to start to learn more about what is said in the bible. If it creates even just one more 'believer', it has done it's job. It was a lot more 'thrilling' than the original movies. You can tell it had a much larger budget. I highly recommend it!!"

However neither its religious fundamentalism nor political conservatism presumably appealed much to TV moguls so we have a small(ish) film instead. Most of the book's plot is ditched and instead a sort of 70's style aeroplane disaster movie is slightly awkwardly inserted to tie the characters together. The script is at least better than that of say '2012', treating the rapture with the same po-faced seriousness of any good Mayan prophecy. The special effects are cheaper though. The whole is better than the sum of its parts; solid direction and acting (Nick Cage is good as always, the supporting cast surprisingly winning) helps. However the film works best as a study of decent people under stress and just about winning out (as you rather hope and believe they would). As a result it has a strong redemptive streak that exceeds that of the underlying book series."

But if this painfully boring, bad excuse for a science fiction fairytale wasn't crazy enough, they even featured a Muslim bit actor whose \"God\" evidently wasn't the same as the Christian god (which is total horse manure), gets \"left behind,\" too. But what was perhaps the saddest moment of all about this pile of rotten dog excrement was the fact that Nicolas Cage's film career has evidently slipped so low that he would actually even THINK of participating in an pitiful piece of cinematic junk like this. Even his agent is probably wallowing in self pity for allowing him to destroy what's left of Cage's long career by starring in this turkey. If the producer's intention was to \"lead people to God\" by making this colossal waste of good film stock, he's only succeeded in leading people AWAY from God, not towards him. This disaster movie is one holy mess."

I was mystified when I heard they would put Nick Cage in it, but he really did well in the part. The young woman who played Chloe was fabulous and the fellow who played Buck also did really well. Most of the cast did well. I think it got low ratings from people who were expecting this $16 million dollar movie to be as well done as a $200 million dollar movie.

I could have listed to the whole movie on only my left front speaker and it would have sounded the same.\n\nTo have a group of talented actors, a huge budget and a promising story go so horribly wrong is truly the work of an imbecile. This film looks very much like an amateur production and the actors no matter how hard they tried couldn't pull the movie around. This is a shallow and boring film with very little action.

I know these days everything is either \"totally amazing\" or \"utter crap\" but the reality is that most things are somewhere in between... And this movie is no different. It is not brilliant, but it is not crap either. Nicholas Cage gets a lot of bad press for his movies, but this I think is a better one that a lot of his latest ones. The story is of course based on the Christian 'Rapture', but that in itself is not rammed down your throat and the movie is not preachy at all. It turns outs it's just a reasonable disaster movie with a sub plot that is setup for more movies in the series as per the books it's based on. The overall acting was good, the effects reflect the movies budget and the script did okay! Not an oscar winner, but also not a bad movie!"

And he can be pretty poor. Mostly it's when you can see he doesn't believe in a project. And this movie has nothing going for it. Everything from the cinematography to the acting to the music to the script. Terrible terrible terrible!\n\nAnd boring! I kept falling asleep. There is this hilarious moment where we see people running around the parking lot of a mall like ants. It is ridiculous. There is a scene where a school bus falls off a bridge. A half hour after the rapture? Did it take God that long to decide if the driver was going to heaven or not?\n\nWord is that LaHaye was quoted as saying, \"It is the best movie I have ever seen on the rapture.\" Jenkins was quoted, \"I believe it does justice to the novel and will renew interest in the entire series.\"\n\nWell if you have ever tried to read these books you might believe it. Terrible. Not talking about the story. I am talking about the writing. I know 14 year olds who can write better and the same way with the script.\n\nAshley Tisdale backed out of doing this movie. Smart move.\n\nThere is this very funny moment where Nic figures out his wife has been rapturetized and he starts to cry but you can see he was laughing. That is sad. Really sad.\n\nIt is sad that this movie is worse than the first version. In fact, the first one was downright amazing compared to this piece of crap. Do yourself a good deed.\n\nDO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!"

Cage brings a element to a film that makes it stand above the rest and, though some of his recent movies haven't been great, he brings a lot to any movie that he's in. The other actors in the film are fine in their roles.\n\nPowerful, thrilling, and featuring a great Nicolas Cage performance, \"Left Behind\" is a must-see. Highly recommended."

It will be an intellectual film featuring witty conversations between the rabbit and the homeless person as they trek through the desert on their way to a surf competition in San Diego. Along the way the bunny must make enough money pan handling for the ex-pizza man turned homeless person to enter and win the surf competition so they can retire in Maui with the bunny's ex-spouse.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to confess that I bought this movie a bit on a whim and my purchase decision was mostly based on the fact that Nicolas Cage was in it. That was a mistake! I should have done a wee bit more research before wasting my money. I did not really have any hopes that it would be a great movie but I at least hoped that it would be a somewhat decent disaster / apocalypse movie. Sadly, it is nothing of the kind.\n\nThis time I have to side with the people trashing this movie, even the so called \"critics\" at Rotten Tomatoes. This is a bad movie. It could have been a half decent movie. The basic idea is perhaps not super original but it could have been made to work. However, it is simply loaded with religious bullshit. Once you filter out said bullshit, which is bloody difficult since you are more or less force feed it during most of the movie, there is really nothing left.\n\nThe behavior of people are bizarre to say the least. The dialogue is mostly nonsensical. The movies attempt at putting different and original characters, including an obnoxious dwarf, on the plane is feeble. The action and special effects are generally lousy and the attempts to put some thrill and drama into the landing of the plane is laughable. Come on, you see a plane coming, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that it has no pilot and is flying in a straight line. You are over the Atlantic, a minor course change would have done the job and there was plenty of time. But nooo, the idiot script writer had Cage fly in a straight line like a chicken race until it was too late. And do not get me started on the stupidity of having someone driving down a stretch of highway in a pickup truck knocking over plastic cones to \"clear it for landing\".\n\nThe only reason this movie gets any stars at all is because I do like Nicolas Cage even in a lousy movie like this."

        "review_detailed_main": "-Well on the bright side, it was not as bad as The Legend of Hercules. Oh yeah, review! So Left Behind is the remake of the original Left Behind which was based in the book about what happens to those left behind when every Christian and baby go to heaven during the Rapture.\n\n-So as great as that concept sounds, the film was just bad. Like really bad. To be fair, the concept was really good and the scene where all the believers are Raptured was pretty good. Aaaaaaand that's where the fun begins and ends.\n\n-The pace was tedious and just cut back and forth between unnecessarily added drama on an airplane and a bad actress running around on earth.\n\n-Speaking of acting. Nicholas Cage was just Nicholas Cage and not a very good Nicholas Cage. Everyone else (mostly) was pretty bad with the daughter especially cringe-worthy. However, Marty from Pirates of the Caribbean was in it and actually offered some pretty funny lines.\n\n-Speaking of cringe worthy, the writing was really bad. Sooo many dumb things that are straight from a Syfy original. Random slomo explosions that actually reminded me that I liked Transformers 4 more! I literally would have been inexplicably if Liam Neeson had shown up to beat people up on the plane and then Denzel Washington landed it after rolling it upside down. Makes no sense right? Neither does the bad writing.\n\n-CG was really bad. Music was cheesy. Anything else? -I will give it one thing, there were a few lines that were pretty good, but the film really failed to get the message across. Literally everyone dodged the issue until Cage finally brought up the idea. Then several cuts to other scenes made sure that the explanations were all cut short and implied afterwards.\n\n-Content was fine.\n\n-So Left Behind had a great concept and should have been great, but just was not. Like at all. So I would say that Left Behind is just not worth seeing. Christian or not. Watch the original. Its sooo much better. And since I have to rate it, I would give it something like a 4 or 4.5/10. Yeah I'll give it points for the concept, Rapture scene, Marty, and ONE line."

Sure, it is preachy, a bit stilted but it does have some effective editing and is is certainly not Nichols Cage's worst movie. There are moments of good acting from the lesser known actors and moments of cheesiness as well. Could I suggest that viewers should shelve their pro or anti Christian bias and sit back and enjoy the movie as it is - an OK movie that simply tells a story."

At the critical point in the movie where she is asked to address all the passengers, immediately after her lip gloss has been refurbished. Brilliant!! Lip gloss is obviously key to the plot and sums up the film.\n\nNo idea what Nicolas Cage or Lea Thomson were thinking!! Totally pointless, useless and nonsensical. Don't waste a minute of your time unless you want a laugh.\n\nThe religious references are too pathetic to mention. I just pray there will never be a \"Left behind 2\""

The camera tricks to hide this fact worked at first - very clever, oh yes - but they lost their effect quite quickly.

The film could have done with about five or six or seven or eight or nine or ten or eleven or twelvety hundred thousand more snails, but I can forgive this, given the delightful Donald Trump cameo as Hillary Clinton.\n\nAlthough.\n\nThe film reaches it's climax with Snail Boy returning from heaven with 1 billion Yorkshire Puddings - one too many!

The message is simple, reinforce faith and belief of those who believe, as millions of people are scooped up by God during the Rapture. For those who don't believe, they are left behind to reconcile their future, lack of faith, and loss of loved ones.\n\nThose who believe will be treated to a movie that reinforces their belief and will be happy that someone covered the topic with a full-length motion picture. Those who don't believe, are not likely to be moved towards belief, as theistic and atheistic belief systems are far too complicated matter to address in a movie with one agenda, get people to believe by scaring them into believing that they will be left behind.\n\nLeft Behind is stunningly superficial, as all serious discussion on revealed religions require a responsible handling of meta-physics and epistemology. As it fails to take on these serious discussions, because that is not its purpose, we don't know if it is to be taken seriously or whether it's satire. For this reason, Left Behind can only be said to be intellectually irresponsible and cannot serve as a convincing argument for the Rapture. Finally, Nicolas Cage's performance is almost comical at times, and his conversion to believer, unconvincing.\n\nGiven the times in which we are living, I would love to see a serious movie on the topic of the Rapture. Perhaps Tom Hanks and Ron Howard might have treated the subject matter with greater respect. Left behind should be left alone."

It seems that so much of the country is anti-Cristian lately. It seems to be getting worse and anything to do with God is becoming unpopular.I thought that the movie was exciting and the storyline gripping.It had me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. I thought the special effects were excellent. The actors played their parts really well and they were very believable.I liked it so much that I am buying the whole series of books and I can't wait to read them. I hope that they make a sequel. We will be one of the first to see it!"

It's not for mainstream, and it kind of makes you blush with how corny and cheesy it is. I like thrillers, and this is NOTHING like that at all. The movie is like listening to your crazy evangelical grandmother rant about the apocalypse for two and a half hours, it's that obvious. Everything about the movie just seems so forced and contrived.\n\nIt's really as terrible as it sounds."

I then looked at what the film was about and the penny dropped - The Rapture.\n\nOh my god, I mean, anyone who is absurdly stupid enough to believe in God and the Rapture would love this film.

Julius Rory is another of those hollywood actors/actresses that gets casted and you must wonder which well connected hollywood mogul he is related to get parts in any movie. The film itself is ok but all the parts with Julius are horrible. The vintage filming methods makes the film look intriguing but Julius constant woody perfomance removes all intrigue. With all Oscar buzz around his name, you would think he was a better performer. I guess he's just a typical British Private School Kid. With this movie grossing over 400 million dollars its first week, you would think it would have at least a sprinkle of soul - Authur Shiva (New York Times)"

He saves all the children by making them disappear and scaring their parents to death by doing so? This was shown over here in England on Channel 5 as part of their disaster weekend movie marathon! It's not a disaster movie as such, more a religious diatribe warning people that god is watching and if you don't worship me I'll take your children away!! And anyone who does not believe in God is also fair game. Planes falling out of the sky, like the one that crashes into Cage's plane, fires starting all over the place, and crime going through the roof.\n\nThe only reason I continued to watch this drivel was for Nicky Whelen as the flight attendant!

Including a short person and a Middle Eastern guy was brilliant. It made for good chemistry.\n\nAlthough Cage was wooden through most of it, I really believed that his character was sorry about doubting his wife, missing his daughter, and almost committing adultery. That much he did well.\n\nI liked the action sequences with the daughter in different vehicles and some of the explosions. They were just the right amount of sensational.\n\nEven the confrontation between Christian and doubter at the airport was done well. Neither party got too carried away. The Christian lady kept her cool and the doubting daughter knew when to walk away.\n\nI'm not sure what the point was of having Lea Thompson in it for a few minutes, but I guess it gave the picture more star power.\n\nMy favorite part involved the mom's pastor admitting that he didn't have genuine faith. He explained it simply and beautifully.\n\nO.K., it had some 70's disaster film clich\u00e9s, but those cheesy aspects make it fun. We loved those movies didn't we? Finally, the Christian message was not heavy-handed at all. It was barely emphasized, except to indicate that non-believers had some repenting to do.\n\nIn addition, the two blondes playing the daughter and stewardess provided some eye candy, and I assume the journalist character did the same for the ladies. Cage looked really old and tired."

Let me get back to those weird actors in the movie. One of the main characters Chloe Steel, isn't the best actor I've seen, I don't know any other movies by the person playing the Chloe role, which means I just can jump to the conclusion that she is a bad actress, But in this movie, I personally didn't like her acting at all.

The rest of the first book's elements and characters are entirely left out, possibly for a sequel film but who knows, leaving us with a dumbed-down adaptation designed mostly to get people in the theater seats to watch it. The 2000 Cloud Ten Pictures version was much better at handling the entire story of the first book, compressed as it was for the amount of screen time the studio could afford to show it in.

All the main protagonists are non-Christians, and the few Christians that present themselves are shown to be troublesome fanatics or hypocrites. Not anything anyone would want to emulate.\n\nThe only redeeming Christian quote that was relevant to being a Christian was a brief quote by a Pastor Barnes who had been left behind when his flock was raptured. When confronted with the question of why he wasn't raptured also, after having worked in the ministry and having preached there, his reply was, \"That's not what counted!\" How true! He continues saying, \"I knew the words. I could quote the chapters and the verses, but that was not enough. You have to believe!\" The interlocutor replied for the audience watching the film, \"Believe? Believe in what? In a God that killed my father. A God that grabbed my mother and my brother and whisked them out of this world. A God that crashes planes and destroys cities?\" This film does no justice to the Christian community nor its dogmas!\n\nThe only reason to watch this film, if one can be found is if you are a fan of airplane disaster flicks of which I tired of long ago."

        "review_detailed_main": "It seems I have once again discovered a disaster epic that has the intolerable effrontery to call itself \"Christian\". The truth is simpler: it's not even good fantasy.\n\nHere's an interesting bit of news you might not be aware of: The Rapture isn't mentioned anywhere in the Bible -- Old or New Testament, it doesn't matter; it's never been discussed. The whole concept of The Rapture originated in the middle nineteenth century with the work of the Irish dispensationalist theologian John Nelson Darby.\n\nDarby fell off his horse in 1827 and as a result began to believe that the \"kingdom\" described in the Book of Isaiah and elsewhere in the Old Testament was entirely different from both the Christian churches already well established by then and all of Judaism. He could have read any standard world history book and reached the same conclusion, but he fell off his horse instead, proving that eventually, some form of enlightenment reaches all of us, sooner or later. He eventually came to believe that the very notion of a clergyman was a sin against the Holy Spirit, because it limited the recognition that the Holy Spirit could speak through any member of the Church. This was a period when \"speaking in tongues\" could enliven any Bible Study meeting, and could thereby be used to validly reinterpret any of the Biblical texts with far more authority than any of the ideals advanced by educated clergy, who were, after all, primarily endowed with the Sin of Pride in authority and education. He recognized that anybody could be possessed of the Holy Spirit, and that anybody could, therefore, interpret the Bible in whatever way they wished -- provided, of course, it was the Holy Spirit coming upon them and not some other stray spirit otherwise requiring an exorcism. Fortunately, this woebegone heresy has yet to destroy the Exorcist movies enjoyed by horror fans worldwide, which is more than you can say about the repeated attempts to film \"Left Behind\" and its associated attempts to create Christian Apocalyptic Horror that's kicked off with a phantastic heresy.\n\nIt's very hard not to feel great disappointment that one of my favorite actors, Nicholas Cage, is forever associated with this particular effort. I have, however, always considered it an admirable trait for a working actor to accept whatever work is offered him should his expected wage be met, and have always noted that the best actors have the most interesting careers as a result of this quality. I can hardly place the blame for this mess of a movie on the actors. The blame is entirely the fault of the authors and the producers for trying to turn the heretical fancies of the Irish phantasist John Nelson Darby into a Christian folktale, and have not only failed to do so, but have insulted an entire religion in the process.\n\nDarby was one of the original members of the Christian movement that became known as the Plymouth Brethren. It was at this point in his life that he he first began discussing his views of pre-tribulation rapture, a non-sexual transportation ethic that the true author of the Book of Revelations would have denounced in horror. Ironically, the Rapture has since become a Christian Horror movie trope that has been denounced in horror by actual horror fans worldwide, one that has been widely acclaimed as the Willie Wonka steampunk version of Dante's Paradiso, the one book of his Divine Comedy that nobody reads unless they are forced to do so, and even then only the Cliffs Notes version applies. In this reviewer's opinion, these dispensationalist musings deserve to be \"Left Behind\" as something the meek have established amongst us, thereby allowing them to present zombie apocalyptic structures without the necessity of raising the dead and post-apocalyptic ruminations without being forced to subdivide the atomic radioactive elements, a series of scientific belief systems that many of the unwashed and uneducated continue to deny, or at the very least to doubt the efficiency of in a world where the structure of reality must at all costs be denied, being made up, as it is, with mostly nothing wrapped up in mysteries and electromagnetic wails of intemporate disbelief.\n\nIn any case, Darby's non-Biblical ramblings about the Rapture to come quickly gained popularity among end-times-oriented Christians, thanks especially to its incorporation into the notes and illustrations of study Bibles, such as the Scofield Reference Bible (1909). Darby translated numerous versions of the Bible and included his note on the Rapture whenever he could do so. It should be remembered, however, that none of it can be found within the actual pages of the Bible, and cannot, therefore, be considered as Truth emitted and translated by the Mind and Mouth of God. And thank God for that -- anybody who has read the books or watched the movies incorporating this ridiculous heresy cannot help but be horrified with the simplicity of plot structure that's been incorporated into such stories.\n\nThere's nothing quite so annoying as a movie that refers to itself as Christian Horror or Christian Drama, depending upon how indoctrinated the authors are at denying human nature and scientific reality. I can hardly wait for the anime versions of such works to come, primarily because I cannot see anybody taking the time to retranslate such works back into the English from which they originated. The same goes for such works that refer to themselves as \"webisodes\".\n\nIn any case, given my rejection of a myth-managed belief system that remains insulting at best, it's hard to become enthusiastic about stories that are wrapped-up in such insults. That is the primary problem with the books these movies came from, and it reflects poorly on the movies themselves. It stands ill-engaged upon the consequences of one's belief in scientific truths, insisting that the errors of one's education, Christian or not, given the contempt for Christianity that the belief in Rapture tends to propagate, will ultimately prevent one from being swept up in the mass disappearance of \"decent\" Americans, leaving only the tribulation audience to inherit and ultimately destroy the nation and world that most of us have grown to love, with the possible exception being those who assert themselves as better than human, a further step in their personal evolution of the species who cannot apparently love anything so worthy as an inheritance.\n\nThis movie isn't even worth the discussion of value. It is insulting, irresponsible, and contemptible in its major themes. Calling itself Christian anything is an insult to Christianity. The theme of Rapture is not Christian at all. The whole idea of the Rapture was invented by a 19th century Irishman who introduced his silly theology in the advertising section of Bibles he was clearly pleased to promote. It is contemptible in that it denies the Judgment all men must strive for in order to erase it from the possible history of those who accept this warped version of God's will. Its heroes are the vanished and the unJudged, and as such it promotes any ugliness those men who consider themselves worthy of God's Dispensation may elect to rediscover for themselves as such men who place themselves, their lives, and their desires above those of other men have always done. Should you Reject what they Reject, Believe what they Believe, and Silence those they wish to Silence, than you too can carry yourself and your soul into the new world without fear of Judgment by man or God. That and only that is the true message of Dispensation, and as such it is an obscenity that also lacks the energy that true horror builds within itself.\n\nThe cold and uncalculated contempt for the ordinary that \"Left Behind\" has promoted is not drama and is not horror -- it is merely what happens after the \"blessed\" beings of Christ's \"true church\" vanish from the Earth in an act neither Christians nor Jews have ever imagined, let alone promoted as a tenet of their faith.\n\nI could still have gone along with it, however, if the story being told had at least been an enjoyable ride. It is not. It's just more tripe by those who deny the world and place themselves above it. It's just religious elitism that hides underneath a truly self-serving and insulting tale that rejects both science and reality. This collection of senseless thought isn't even worthy of the curiosity it might otherwise evoke in those ignorant of its roots. You can't lose yourself in the story, so it's best just to lose the story itself. Then you can hope for yourself that it stays lost longer than the Nag Hammadi scrolls that were rediscovered in 1945. Unlike the Nag Hammadi library, The Left Behind series -- books and movies -- deserves anonymity and eventual extinction.\n\nI rate this one a single star 'cause it's a repeat and it's still a mess. And that's a gift."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK here's the deal. These books were so amazing I (like millions of ppl) seriously have been waiting years for this movie. These were the best most compelling books I have ever read, and I read everything. I waged my own mini social media campaign with the production co, book writers etc to try to ensure they didn't make it cheesy, low budget like the last one and like every Christian themed current-times movie (they do OK on the ones from biblical times). I am rating it very high simply so that they will get plenty of traffic to the theater so that they will continue as planned and make the next one from the series of books. I am assuming that the next one will be vastly better once they take in the critiques and feedback from this one. The pro's were it kept your interest, the plane scenes were decent in terms of suspense and the acting improved as the movie progressed. My expectations were low and I'm not sure why I have to have low expectations except that based on the past 20 years of movies with any kind of religious theme, they have this odd propensity to come out like cable TV movies with poor acting and poor effects. No clue why because the Christianish movies always do well at the box office even though the viewers cringe through them. Please give us something to RAVE about just once!! So here are my gripes: 1) why oh why do they always have to portray the Christian character in the movie like some flowery, simplistic, somewhat strange, unlikeable character? In real life that is so far off from whats true. Why cant they have had the mother as an intelligent, strong, dynamic career woman that was desperately trying to ensure her family was informed and prepared for what she knew was coming? Everyone I know in Corporate America is a Christian and I have never come across one remotely like the mother in this film. Instead Leah Thomson's character was so wimpy, over acting, not real, whiny and annoying that you could see clearly why she was unable to persuade her family in any direction. Someone that has strong convictions does not come across like that, believe me. I could have recommended a slew of women I know that they could have used to blow that role out of the park. 2) Why does the daughter/non Christian have to be boiling- over angry at God and anyone that believes?? The realty is most non Christian's aren't like Chloe's character at all, and wouldn't be yelling at their mom for believing, and yelling at random ppl in the airport for believing, they are just PASSIVE, no real strong opinion either way- so her character would have been more believable as just a 20- something girl busy with her life, no time to really focus on God with all her other priorities and thinking her mom is just too into the bible for her taste. 3) Why cant a Christian movie ever have any heart wrenching, dramatic, tear jerker, meaningful, moments? I'm talking about the scene in Forest Gump where he buries Jenny and talks to her grave about their son or when Lt Dan screams at God from the sail of the boat. Or the scene in Shawshank where Morgan Freeman sits down at the stone wall and reads the note he digs up from under the rock. Actually put Morgan Freeman in the sequel because his voice alone adds depth and drama to any movie involving GOD. That's what this movie needed- it was way too focused on the chaos of ppl disappearing and didn't include one moving, jolting message or emotional scene that brings you to your knees, when the book was FULL of those!! Nicholas Cage was a little to wamsy pamsy to be Rayford Steel, the character needed to be much more strong, authoritative, charismatic. Buck was good. American Idol girl was not, Scene with gun was way too long and awkward. Little person was good. Need more normal characters next time, please. They need a panel of critics that are not involved with movie industry but are nonetheless movie going experts that can consult with them throughout production on what works and what doesn't. I literally could have advised them down to the expressions on the faces of the actors as to what worked and what needed to change. So I'm giving it an 8 simply because I wasn't as disappointed as I thought I'd be but still so annoyed that I have to have lowered expectations on a movie based on books that sold over 40 mill. Cant steven spielberg make the sequel? If it wasn't based on these phenomenal books attempting to deliver a super important message Id likely had given it a 5 on the 'real movie rating' scale...."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having previously read the book series, I was happy to see a much more polished production, and better actors than the 2000 version. When you cast Kirk Cameron and he's the star talent, well....... I disagree that there was hidden Christian agendas throughout the movie. The whole book series is closely based on the book of Revelations as the events unfold. The only real creative liberties taken were in the creation of characters to give the story a human element. The actual series is quite long, and if they develop the book series to the big screen, I think you'll find that it's not portraying the ones Left Behind as moral degenerates but, more like regular people drowning in the culture of greed that the world is becoming. I say this because, later in the series these folks become the heroes, again creating the human element, as you witness them develop into their full potential. Sure, the story comes from the Christian bible but, the human element is quite real and exists in each of us. Who doesn't know someone that's been flattened by the churning machine our world has become and never really completely recover? Just follow the series and you'll see that it's all about the unique qualities, skills and gifts that reside in ALL of us, and the elements of self reflection and realization. Many can argue (and I'll usually agree) that the modern Christian church message is pretty distorted, and pretty judgmental. But, few can argue that the actual message of Christ (whether you are a believer or not) is a beautiful message teaching tolerance, patience, compassion and love toward each other, regardless of how they believe, social status, income bracket, etc. You could almost say He created the first MASS hippie movement of that time. Teaching peace, love and tolerance. :)"

The movie is way more about the plane almost crashing than anything else. The 2016 version is way worse, paranoid and ReichWing.\n\nThe biggest question of the movie remains unanswered: Do the clothes that are left behind include underwear? If they do, does that mean that xtians are going to heaven/purgatory ....COMPLETELY NAKED???? That seems kind of perverse.\n\nFor a supposed xtian movie it has a lot of cleavage shots with jiggly breasts of their female lead, Cassi Thompson. She's Australian.\n\nEven without the religious mumbo-jumbo it's just a low budget movie with a poor script and hardly any production value. How they got the three main protagonists to sign for this crap is the real mystery, but if anything, it underlines the plummeting career of Cage.\n\n3/10 The Melancholic Alcoholic."

        "review_detailed_main": "Woefully under-budgeted new film version of the 20 year old best-selling Christian Apocalypse book series by Tim Lahaye & Jerry Jenkins (although some fans are already strongly protesting that very little of the books is contained at all here) reconfirms the frustratingly insular nature of the \"Contemporary Religious Film\" genre: no personal artistic or thematic vision, characters coming off as rather smarmy (almost as if the film's determinedly comfortable upper-middle-class viewpoint regarding the terrors of Armageddon was dramatized on the Lifetime or Hallmark cable TV channels), and its increasingly labyrinth insistence on 'exploring' each trapped character for several interruptable talky minutes (the 'businessman', the 'Middle Easterner', etc.). The film's broken, opportunistic dramaturgy centers around the dysfunctional relationship between airline pilot Rayford Steele (Nicolas Cage), his adult estranged daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson), and further strained by the earnest spiritual zeal of Steele's newly Christianized ex-wife Irene (Lea Thompson). Each is adequately introduced but as Steele's scheduled Trans-Atlantic passenger flight is suddenly interrupted by the worldwide Rapture described in the Book of Revelations, the film-\u2014probably due to a lack of budget cancelling out the ability to cut away to anything--begins a strange stop/start episodic dragging involving the actors that continues throughout the somewhat bipolar Act II; Chloe\u2014after witnessing a couple hundred extras running madly around a shopping mall parking lot to indicate world chaos--is so distanced from the other characters while wandering throughout the city it is almost as if the filmmakers were trying to film a female version of Richard Matheson's book \"I Am Legend,\" while up above somewhere Steele swerves between tearfully trying to reach Chloe by cell phone or giving increasingly tired speeches to his rather grimy set of passengers. Cage's adequate medium-star wattage (he and Thompson almost seem to come from another era) , combined with the perhaps-unintentional stunt casting (Olympian Lolo Jones as an airline ticket agent, American Idol contestant Jordin Sparks as a distressed mother-with-a-gun) and regional dinner-theater level actor hires combine as well as can be expected. Obviously, Nicolas Cage can be an acquired taste and those campily hoping that Cage would here apply some of his previous excesses as seen in such test-pilot crashes as VAMPIRE'S KISS or PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED are bound to be disappointed. He is not a literary actor (which would make his agreement with this type of mass market fiction perfectly understandable) but has always made an earnest, even goofy attempt to understand the oddity or severe crutch of his characters (from MOONSTRUCK to the bottled rage of his LEAVING LAS VEGAS), and his Rayford Steele here\u2014although light years removed from what the novel's more conventional, Robert Redford/George Clooney-type characterization of Steele probably originally intended--is workably vulnerable and honest in trying to deal with both his daughter and his passengers in a nightmarish situation. But it is hard to determine why the filmmakers\u2014although it's done unobtrusively\u2014keep jamming the book's characters together in such listless combinations (a major character of the book, a controversial national TV journalist and strong romantic foil for Chloe named Buck Williams, played by 'One Tree Hill's Chad Michael Murray, comes off more like a love-struck puppy who continually keeps fading into the airplane upholstery; the character is included in the film's last shot as if the filmmakers were genuinely frightened we wouldn't remember him). This new incarnation of the book has taken several years to be put together\u2014British director/veteran stunt arranger Vic Armstrong was signed two years ago\u2014but it almost appears as if the time was used by the producers to erase any hint of an auteur. Armstrong's scenes are decisively staged individually but--strung together using the script's milky characters and apolitical stance (there is no explanation of what happened to either the NSA, the US military, air marshals or any local law enforcement)--the film has a murky, amorphous forward propulsion that cancels out the potential subliminal terror the situation was striving for (achieved in the antichrist THE OMEN film trilogy and much more cheaply in the 1970s Christian film market THIEF IN THE NIGHT trilogy). Some understandably have already written the results off with ridicule but as it unspooled\u2014even with its admitted faults\u2014I had to admit it has a disarmingly sincere, humorously tilted core about the spontaneous meetings with strangers and interpersonal conflicts of this life, and it hesitates to become too obviously 'preachy' on implied standards of spirituality. The film at least has a professional look provided by Clint Eastwood's former cameraman Jack Green and Robert Altman's son Stephen Altman as art director, and the stunt-/special effects-heavy climax, as befitting one supervised by a stunt coordinator like Armstrong, is not bad considering his lack of resources. The LEFT BEHIND movie series will probably manage one more sequel before either stopping completely or going the 'straight to DVD' route but its chatty brightness, threadbare visual poignancy, and clumsy sincerity is worth a conditional look for those who appreciate modest, adequately put-together works of imaginative faith."

A once great actor who's being manipulated late in his acting career. Why cast his over cooked face as a unsterile looking jet liner pilot for a pointless sleezy movie ride?"

No one knows why this has happened apart from a minority who are seen as mad or going mad. Most of the film is set on a plane where the crew and passengers are confused but have to deal with technical problems with the plane and they have to try and get back to an airport whilst they are over the Atlantic.\n\nThis is basically a Mystery/Aviation film with a little bit of Action as well. (That's the way it came across to me)\n\nAt times the film came across as a little bit narrow minded and didn't have as much action as I thought it would. I'm not sure if this was a budget movie but it did come across that way sometimes and I felt they could have made a bigger impact, for example there could have been scenes showing the global impact of people going missing just so you got more of a sense this was global rather than being concentrated on the plane all the time.\n\nOverall an OK film and not as bad as you think its going to be"

I think the movie told the story pretty well, I did like how this version actually showed the people disappearing and the chaos going on outside in the world. There wasn't a whole lot of character development behind the characters, so some of them I just didn't care much about, that was another big problem, they didn't make you care about the main or supporting characters. I really hate it when movies do that, I want to care about what happens to the characters in a movie I'm watching. 6/10.

The movie takes too long in building up it's conflict, which is then changes into some unclear moments between people when the main game changer comes. The panic isn't really depicted well. You can still see cars driving slowly among all those screaming people. The acting is just bad. Nicolas Cage lacks on better expressions. It's just if he's forgotten how to act like he did in Face Off. The rest of the cast also didn't act optimally. Probably because they think that the screenplay is so much in discontinuance and illogical and have gaping plot holes everywhere on it."

It is very very far from the worst move ever as several reviews have claimed. Actually it was pretty good as a scifi/fantasy flick. I know it wasn't meant to be campy like Sharknado, but if looked at in that context it was entertaining.\n\nI think the whole Christian motif makes many people close to that religion, either pro or con, like or hate this movie. If you are ambivalent about the religious aspects, it is a pretty cool story and well portrayed.\n\nThe pace of the film is good and it maintains interest. The acting is well done and there is some descent character development. Cage did a way better job than a couple of films I've seen him in recently (Rage 2014). Although far from his finest performance, he made the part believable. The dialog gets bogged down in several spots by spending too much time trying to convey a Christian value set, but it isn't too over the top preachy. And the script does give ample time to the point of view that most fundamentalist Christians are a couple sandwiches short of a picnic.\n\nThe music throughout the film was horrible, gosh, just awful, but it wasn't everywhere so just ignore it.\n\nWe embrace many strange concepts in movies all the time...zombies, vampires, killer computers, demons, honest politicians...well maybe that is a little too far-fetched, but talking animals, witches, gods, ghosts, hobbits, monsters, possession ...it's scifi/fantasy anything goes, so why not Christian mythology? I say give this flick a fair chance, don your Mystery Science Theater 3000 perspective and enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "I truly believe there tends to be some anti-Christian prejudice in Hollywood. Having said that, I can assure you this movie does not have a 2% on Rotten Tomatoes because of the Christian themes. Even the film's target Christian audience despise this movie from what I've read. The sad thing is it's not even fun bad and it should be with Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage in the starring role. The film could use some bees.\n\nCage stars as pilot and family man Rayford Steele, which is the greatest name I've ever seen in a movie since Dirk Diggler in \"Boogie Nights\". In the beginning he plans on having an affair with a sexy blonde stewardess due to the strife between him and his Born Again wife (Lea Thompson, remember her from \"Back to the Future\"?), whom we never see together in the movie. Before he boards the plane, he is confronted by his non-believing daughter, who later has a Meet Cute with International Correspondent Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray). The first half of the movie is supposed to be \"character development\" though not much character is actually developed. We just find out who's a Christian and who's not.\n\nWhen the rapture does happen, chaos ensues both on the plane and on Earth or as much chaos as the budget would allow. With the film's $16 million budget it is pretty clear that most of that went to Cage's salary. The movie is supposed to take place in New York and it looks like it was filmed anywhere but New York (it was filmed in Louisiana). The rapture is a fascinating event that should result in a Roland Emmerich-like spectacle of frenzy. We get scenes like a car crashing into a mall and a small plane falling and crashing into a car. However, for the most part it's just a bunch of extras running around who were probably told \"Please scream and run around in circles!\"\n\nAs for chaos on the plane, do they give out Razzies for CGI? The interior of the plane does not look like it would fit the exterior. The sets are so unconvincing I half expected some guy to pop in the cockpit and say \"I just want to tell you both 'Good Luck', we're all counting on you\". The movie essentially takes what could have been an interesting premise for an action and turns it into a cheap airplane flick like the ones \"Airplane\" spoofed.\n\nWe get a handful of clich\u00e9s like Cage looking at a photo of his family (even that looks horribly photo-shopped). We also get terrible comic relief like random confrontations between a Muslim man and a dwarf. There's also a climax that I choose not to reveal but it is absurd and ridiculous. Although apparently the daughter can ride a motorcycle without a helmet and operate complex machinery without any difficulty.\n\nThe real problem with this film is that it's not even enjoyably bad. It's just boring. Nicolas Cage is so restrained here, he's not even having fun. Much of the movie's plot is just the characters trying to figure out what happened, which isn't fun because we the audience already knows what happened. The movie isn't even subtle about it, we see the clothes and possession of those who were called up, one having a planner with \"BIBLE STUDY\" written on it.\n\nThis is director Vic Armstrong's second film, and the first in over two decades. Despite this he has one of the more impressive resumes in Hollywood. As a famous stunt man he did many of the stunts in the Indiana Jones movies along with others like \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" in the classic skiing scene. However a competent director he is not.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have nothing against wide-released movies aimed at a Christian audience. However I believe Christians deserve much better than this."

Digressing from my own philosophical and rational beefs with the entirety of the Abrahamic umbrella model, the scripting, acting, direction, visual effects, overall plot execution of this hypothetical disaster film we're undeniably amateur to the point that, when coupled with the underlying concept being the rapture, it was obviously made by Christian's on a limited budget. I mean REALLY limited, to point where I can only assume Nicholas Cage and Chris Pine contributed as a kind of heart felt attemp at charity (either that or out of desperation to keep debt collectors at an arms length). One star for the laughs and another for the fact that I can't deny that I WAS entertained."

For starters, the cast of the earlier movie aligned almost perfectly with the book while this particular film had some definite weaknesses. For example, although he is certainly a decent actor, Nicolas Cage didn't seem nearly as convincing in the role of \"Captain Rayford Steele\" as Brad Johnson was in the earlier film. If anything he seemed almost uncomfortable performing the part. Additionally,I thought the scenario involving the airplane seemed to get much more attention than necessary and as a result it negated other equally important details. This fact leads to my main concern which is that this film is supposed to be a Christian movie. Yet the emphasis seemed to be more about the conditions on the airplane rather than the main story. In other words, it misses the big picture. Now, that's not to say that this was necessarily a bad movie by any means. But it didn't have the same impact as the original and for that reason I question whether this remake was even necessary. Slightly below average"

People didn't judge \"Ghost\" years ago, because there wasn't such an anti religious movement back then. Just take away all the prejudice and enjoy the movie. I was glued to the screen until the end. And Nicholas Cage did a great job acting, I just don't understand when people don't like the subject of the movie they must judge the actors in a negative way as well just because they have different beliefs. Nicholas Cage fit the role perfectly and I think that the director Vic Armstrong did a marvelous job with this movie. I hope my daughter will have the privilege to be in one of his movies one day. This could have been a potentially disastrous movie if it wouldn't be for this director's art and courage. The other actors were also wonderful. I personally think the acting was superb with the exception of one or two supporting actors maybe. But without giving the story away, even if I think I would be one of those left behind but I'm not going to doom this movie and give it a bad rating. Some reviewers mention low budget? Are you serious? What planet did they come from? I've seen tons of low budget movies on Netflix, this movie has definitely beaten tons of high budget special effects overloaded movies for me."

The first movie that had Kirk Cameron was pretty low budget, like something you might watch on Lifetime. I remember wondering what the movie might have been like if it had a big budget and an all star cast. Well, this movie fell a little short... actually, it fell waaaay short! As the movie began, you know those little snippets that they show where the production company shows off their name, like DreamWorks with the kid fishing from the moon, or Pixar with the dancing desk light? Well this movie started with 4 or 5 companies that I had never heard of. Next, the movie began with a weak musical score that was, again, reminiscent of a made for TV movie. The acting was pretty poor by most characters and the writing was corny at times with characters inserted that took away from the storyline... like the 'angry little person' or the senior citizens on the plane with Alzheimer's. I have to admit, movies about Aviation or the Military have to do their research to keep me from snickering. The set for the cockpit was awful, the size of the plane making a trans Atlantic flight was incorrect, the plane crossing the Atlantic that they almost collided with was even smaller. And the biggest blooper was the decision to turn around so late after the 'Event' The movie was just poor all the way around, and dragged on at times... but I did like the fact that it provoked thought and opened discussion with my son who I took with me."

Nicolas Cage's acting is no worse (or no better) then in Con Air 17 years earlier and he's done well. Regarding the plot it's extremely difficult to predict anything in the film.\n\nObviously I didn't know what to expect. After a slow start the movie takes you on a ride and holds your attention till the end. Probably the movie was rated bad due to it's low budget which is making itself present in the poor special effects. The movie is probably also not what you would expect of a Nicolas Cage movie as it lacks the usual amount of sex and violence (obviously another reason for it's bad rating). What counts for me is the unpredictability and the suspense, but most of all, what blows your mind is the mystery. If you like mystery and suspense you will enjoy this film.\n\nI'm giving it a 7 because of the poor special effects. But the special effects are not what counts in this film and even without them it would still be a great movie. Which cannot be said about the most Hollywood blockbusters recently coming out since they are mostly only about the special effects."

And this - I'm a 20 something Christian male (yes, we still exist) and I wanted this movie to be mind-blowing. Sadly, it wasn't.\n\nCons Vs Pros (Yep, it's reverse order so you're don't mistakenly think Pros wins.) Cons: 1. The acting is sad and stilted. Some actors are OK (the midget who's name I don't remember, Cage on occasion) but most are just horribly high-school level actors.\n\n2. The writing is full of padding and over stereotyping. All boys do not want a baseball glove, particularly if they wear glasses and have pale skin. All Christians don't sound like the Westboro baptist church or wishy washy whine-bags.\n\n3. The music is 1980's sitcom style. Lots of \"scoobity doo do doo, you'll find your way, just look up to the sky\" type movement and mood music. I want to call it predictable but that word is overused and doesn't really fit. It's more like... sense-dulling. It makes you want to have a glass of milk, cookies, and a long nap.\n\n4. The directing is weak and amateurish. i.e. In the first scent the mom and daughter are having a phone conversation and instead of 2-3 location changes they swap back and forth for every sentence. It can make your head swim.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The message is semi-solid. As one passenger in the plane put it, \"That's it?\". Yes, that's it.\n\nI'd pay James Cameron $4 billion to remake this movie with good actors and a great CGI budget. Maybe we should start a kickstarter campaign."

It isn't. It's about a disaster. More precisely, it's a movie that can't choose between being a serious plane disaster story or a comedy. Anyway, it's just a badly written piece. A bad movie per se, therefore an average movie by Hollowood standards.\n\nThe theme is the rapture, a rather common subject in contemporary Christian American mythology. It makes for a good premise, and a welcome change from the ever popular ghosts, vampires devils, and other classics of superstition.\n\nThink encounter of the 4th kind, i.e., alien abductions, except that we'll never know why the bodies are taken. I expected the (off-screen) death of millions of people, since they're supposed to go to some heaven. Instead, a powerful bully cast the Dungeons & Dragons 6th-level magic spell \"Teleport Without Clothes\" on them. The \"Mass\" version. Now that augurates an orgy of epic proportions, but nothing epic is to be seen in Left Behind. Instead we have dwarf jokes, plus a good amount of involuntary comedy - the main reason why it is indeed a bad movie.\n\nThe story left me thinking, but probably not the way the writers intended me to. For example, I believe all Christian air-pilots will lose their jobs now, and religion will be thoroughly checked for new applicants. And that is not the only job in which people are pretending to take responsibilities, when in fact they believe they could disappear any moment, dropping things on our heads, leaving nuclear plants unattended, and whatnot.\n\nI've got plenty more, but most people don't read long reviews anyway. So, Left Behind is not good enough to recommend watching, but if you really need to make your own opinion, know that at least it's not a snore-fest. It's just very, very cheesy."

Indeed, had the writers decided to take up the challenge of writing of those 'left behind' and how they could redeem themselves, then hope exists for us all. However, the completely shallow and one dimensional script was not only laughable in stages, you wonder how anyone could have signed off their work. The overly theatrical and predictable acting of several scenes show how brainwashed the studios are to think the watching audience can be duped into parting with good money. Surely someone who reviewed the film before release would have raised the white flag and ditched the film. One of the lowlights was watching a once respected actor now at the bottom of his career and you have to question why he agreed to be part of such a disaster.

The script is like something on Hallmark channel or Lifetime, sappy and lifeless, and if you're hoping for some action or disasters to spice things up you're out of luck.

OK, at least I wouldn't disappear!) Anyway, it's not often that I get to choose an apocalyptic type movie when the girls are home \u2013 or any kind of movie that doesn't have girlie type content in it, for that matter. But Nicholas Cage convinced them. Big mistake. A few minutes into the movie and I was checking the year of production on the back cover. It had to be 1980. Nope, 2014. It just looked like a 1980 midday matin\u00e9e. Acting and dialog were dreadful. It had to get better, right? Nope. I was embarrassed for choosing this movie. The girls fell asleep \u2013 thank god \u2013 at least I could lie about how good it was (note to self \u2013 hide the movie in the bottom of the waste bin). I can't believe this movie was ever made, or why anyone would lend their name to it. It's just that Bad! Worst movie I have watched in many years. Only watched to the end as the girls were asleep in their recliners and I thought it must get better. It didn't."

It had me considering things which i want from my films, a good film despite screen play, camera work and special effects only work if you get invested in the idea. Too many people rate films on the whole cinematography of it all. that to me is wrong. This film as you wondering from early on what the main driver is, it clues you up enough through the scenes and you get to see how people break down when unexplained things happen and how some people are literal aholes when THIS IS the time we should be coming together.\n\nCASTING(but mostly NC) - Now, i like nick cage, im not sure where this meme hate comes from, just like nickelback, i can list you 100 more people/bands who are worse. Anyway, i cant take on the meme today. His acting is absolutely fine, it works, I've seen him ina few films like this over the past few years, hes good at the regular guy mode. The other actors especially the plane were great as well, they seemed like the regular life person you meet and the steps you take with the baggage you carry. it felt good, they all played their parts really well. Special mentions to the Islamic character, perfect delivery on the 'oh, this again' feel as a lot of people have with people of different creeds, its sickening to me but he delivered his parts well.\n\noverall - I watched it, listened, it did its purpose, i mean if i were to tell you I've fallen asleep to interstellar twice now (and im massive scifi and supporter of most of the actors in that film) this had me thinking a bit and i didn't fall asleep!"

The concept, which is about the miraculous disappearance of millions of people around the world, really didn't make any sense and the director added pointless characters which weren't interesting at all. On top of that, none of the characters could act and the annoying soundtrack just made matters worse. Cage plays a pilot who has to deal with the strange situation, whilst controlling a plane and trying to land it safely whilst running out of fuel. Some of the passengers also went missing, so everyone is in a panic, including the crew, which doesn't help matters. The film took me hours to watch because I kept on falling asleep, out of share boredom. There are some scenes that went way over the top, like when the girl is jumping into random vehicles to make a runway for the plane, and the ending was terrible. Basically, I hated the movie and I haven't got a good word to say about it! Terrible!\n\nRound-Up: Oh dear! Yet another bad day at the office for Nicolas Cage, who really is struggling to come out of his downhill slump. I bet that Cage can't wait to pay off all his debts so he can start picking some good roles, except for these awful \"made for TV\" films. The sad thing is, Cage has the ability to pull of some good performances, like in Leaving Las Vegas and Lord of War but he has made more bad than good films. Hopefully, he might surprise audiences with an outstanding performance which will bring him back into the limelight but definitely not with this movie. Although I thought that the movie was terrible, it still made a profit at the box office, which is surprising for such an terrible attempt at a fiasco movie.\n\nBudget: $16million Worldwide Gross: $20million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama/thrillers about a pilot who has to safely land a plane while the world has to deal with the miraculous disappearance of millions of people. 1/10"

While the good people have recently vanished, we focus on the story of an airline pilot (Cage) and his daughter who are somewhat strangers to each other. He has been too busy with his job, she's been away at college, but she's coming home and again he's neglecting the relationship. He has to fly to Europe this time. Once again there is tension. Her Mom has become a Jesus freak and her little brother is a cool little fella.\n\nSuddenly, millions of people disappear and there is a lot of drama and action. It's an apocalyptic film about the end of the world, or almost the end. Will these remaining people \"repent\" and maybe go to heaven too? We won't find out in this movie, but the audience is asking the questions: could this really happen as the Bible seems to indicate? (side note, this isn't how the Bible describes it. Many people use a verse or two to create a paradigm of righteous people being swept up so they won't have to be persecuted. It's misinterpreted). Will there be a \"rapture\" of all the saints, while the \"bad\" people are left on earth to suffer and die? Who knows, but in this movie it happens.\n\nThe protagonist seems like a good person, so I'm not sure why she's left behind. She meets a nice, good looking man (Murray) and he also seems like a really decent guy. So what's missing with these supposed kind and level-headed people? Why didn't they go too?\n\nThis looks and feels like a blockbuster film, but there is something glaringly wrong with the whole setup. As you watch, you will notice little things that give it away...things like odd music that seems out of place, almost period music, like 80's television movies, or maybe some 90's music too, and once in a while the music is standard for our time. It's an odd combination.\n\nNicolas Cage does fine, it's obvious this was one of his last attempts at something decent before he went rogue. Now he's just an actor-of-fortune, does whatever, whenever he can, with reckless abandon. His last 40 movies (no joke) since 2014 have been busts, but he just does it for the paycheck. He has another 4 projects in the works. This man is prolific.\n\nI really liked this movie. I always have enjoyed Airline disaster stories. This one has good special effects. The large passenger jet is the primary location for most of the scenes, and it was done right. The explosions and air shots and the scenery were all very well done. I think there is just something amiss. The supporting cast are almost all very cheesy and amateur in their presentations and this is really the main detractor."

The first class cabin passengers were well chosen, but added nothing to the story except confusion. Nick Cage played his usual reluctant sleazy hero type. To be fair this is not the worst film that I've seen him in, but comes close. The biggest disappointment was the two story lines that eventually meet up with hugs and kisses amidst apocalyptic styled road works. The lead up to this is slow slow slow ... Some have said that this is a poor film, but I say this is a film deserving a second chance. On the whole I liked it ... Especially the light reading on the Message Board."

Why is it most every movie involving Christians always makes them out to be crazy lunatics? Is this what movie watchers want to see? If you want to show a flick about \"The Rapture\" and make it out to be a disaster flick, then it wouldn't hurt to give a little bit of a history lesson to help explain what the heck is going on. Back it up with Bible scriptures not just scenes of planes and cars crashing, people running everywhere and pure chaos. Small roles from Lea Thompson (from the 80's Back to the Future and All The Right Moves) and singer Jordin Sparks (American Idol) are recognizable but nothing to write a review about. What I liked best about watching this movies was the reactions from the people sitting in the theater. From screams at suspenseful scenes, talking out loud trying to explain parts of the movie and those who don't get out much behaving like their at home sitting in the living room watching TV."

This script reads like a draft version from a first year film student and you just wonder why they didn't do their homework on such an important endeavor. They had $31M in the budget and should have had a better script.\n\nWhen movies bomb then budgets get cut for the entire genre and that's sad because the Christian genre can succeed, but it needs professionals in some of the key areas and not amateurs who made a direct to DVD movie before. God bless Paul Lalonde for getting this made, but God can't turn a bad script into a good movie just because a producer deserves it and that's the lesson for everyone.\n\nPrayer is great, but God expects you to do the work and that includes having the right people at your side to support you."

Turns out this is a world-wide happening. And, of course, panic grips most people.\n\nTo be honest, this is a little over the top. When people start disappearing no one cries out something about The Rapture. No, Hollywood has panic spread throughout as it makes for better action. The dialogues of the passengers on the plane were angry, and for the most part lame and believe the Captain has all the answers as they charge to the cockpit. Jordin Sparks as a passenger who just lost her son, acted wildly over the top. Can't blame her, blame the writers of this somewhat over the top movie.\n\nCaptain Steele and photo Journalist Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) are the only ones who act reasonably in this crisis, but wait there's a plane heading on a direct line toward them and Captain Steele sees that no one is piloting that plane. Looks like things are going to get worse.\n\nThis movie makes you feel as though there is no God and most everyone is an Atheist and no one has any clue about The Rapture. It takes quite a while for the people to be hit over the head and finally come to believe, well, maybe there is a God and what do we do now?\n\nThe ending is really over the top as Steele's daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) does her best to clear a runway so the plane can land. She even drives a Steamroller. I wouldn't have a clue as to how to start one. (and who leaves the keys in one?) But to be fair these are exciting scenes and even I was on the edge of my seat helping Cassie start that steamroller to clear a path. Hey, when in Rome, help out. Exciting, but still over the top.\n\nSadly, it was the dialogues and some bad acting by some that didn't make this the success it could have been. Since I am a big Nicolas Cage fan he did good. He really did. So did Chad Michael Murray and Cassi Tomson. (4/10)\n\nViolence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

I am surprised they not only got Nicolas Cage and Lea Thompson to appear, I was also astonished that the film was shown in theaters. Low budget, poor effects, dialog, and daytime soap acting are not the only plagues upon this film.\n\nI am not here to preach about various religious beliefs or the beliefs of atheists. I know for a fact, not all Christians believe or promote the idea of a rapture. There are many views among Christians regarding the rapture which is never mentioned in the Bible. The older Christian denominations do not believe that a group of people is left behind on earth. This is a fairy-tale, only told by the evangelistic movement.\n\nBut I can suspend my disbelief for some good fiction any day. However this is not good fiction. It is at best a disaster movie with a Christian candy wrapper on it. Take away the rapture and toss in the \"alien abduction theory\" and you have the same poorly made disaster film. The movie has no message or hidden agenda or meaning, other than to make some money.\n\nSome of these reviews said it was promoting religion, but not once was anyone told what must be done to become a Christian. I found the hospital scene very curious saying that 100% of all the children were taken. Catholics and various other religions believe even as a child we are born into sin. It amazed me that no children were left behind. They tacked on a 17 and under clause in there. In my opinion, the movie was created to generate profits not convert anyone.\n\nThis is not the first stinker that was funded by a religious movement. \"Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959)\" and \"The Jupiter Menace (1983)\" was also created by them."

If you're looking for a clear gospel message, you probably won't find it here. It's like they took the main characters and one small scene from the plane, and almost totally rewrote it.

Leaving the theater, I was asking myself, \"How could a movie about something so big, be so bland?\" Speculating, it may be that too much money was spent on the A list actor and not enough on development of the screenplay. I know there are many non-believers in Hollywood, and what appears to have happened is that this movie was influenced by that element so much that major themes that would have made the movie more interesting, were simply avoided or left-out. I enjoyed the performances of Cassie Thompson (playing Chloe Steele) and Nicky Whelan (playing Hattie Durham) but overall, I believe this movie had so much more potential and left the theater feeling like Hollywood did not really present much substance about the Rapture other than it's depiction of it's occurrence."

All the theology the anti-Christ and how both Johnson and Cameron become part of a group of conspirators thwarting his ambitions is all jettisoned.\n\nThe action switches from the plane to the ground as Cage's wife Lea Thompson and young son get caught up in the Rapture. His daughter is busy looking for a landing spot for his 747 as the airports are in a state of panic. The daughter is played by Australian actress Cassie Thomson and she is suitably panic stricken, but up to the job.\n\nLest the audience think that this is a Christian end times film we have a Moslem character as one of the plane passengers. I doubt many Moslems got to see it in any event.\n\nStripped of most of the end times theology this Left Behind film is just Nicholas Cage bringing in an airplane under extremely hazardous and unusual flying conditions.

        "review_detailed_main": "But even though it seems to be universally hated, I was entertained, and that's all I ever ask of a film. I saw the original series in the early 2000s, and I wish they'd have remade all 3. Maybe it's my partiality to Mr. Cage, as I find him so believable, even in the worst roles/movies, which are nearly always carried and rescued by him. He literally becomes whatever character he portrays, and that's a real feat considering he's been in well over 100 movies! No offense to Kirk Cameron, who played the pilot in the original movie series and actually is very religious, but I really was moved by Nicholas Cage's anguished portrayal of the airline pilot. Even though I knew the story already, there was still a lot of suspense. A few of the supporting actors really good, and the rest were capable. It's too bad the script couldn't have been jazzed up a bit, because this story had a huge amount of potential. Maybe they weren't allowed to change it up. The books have a lot more detail, but they don't have Nicolas Cage. Regardless of the reason some people were taken and others were left behind (religion or if it had been something else, such as alien abduction) this film was still good for me as a thriller. The direction, cinematography and production weren't outstanding but not bad, either. The special effects, such as empty vehicles crashing and the widespread scattering of clothes and belongings, were effective and not over-used. I took a few stars away. One was taken for predictability, whether or not the viewer has read the books or seen the original movie(s). Another was taken because I felt the music was a little over-dramatic, and the song being played during the end credits sounded cheesy to me. The last was taken because the cinematography and overall production wasn't inspired or overwhelming, but only average to me. If you're very religious or just like movies with stuff decent suspense, it's not the worst way to spend a couple of hours. Pass if you expect a superb blockbuster of a movie with plot twists. You know what they say about opinions...! This one was mine, and I hope it helps somebody decide: to watch, or not to watch! This is definitely not Shakespeare, but during his era, options were limited, and he had no competition!"

Begrudgingly, I am going to see Left Behind, because I want to be able to give an honest and knowledgeable answer to the question, \"What did you think of the Left Behind movie ?\" Seems a heavy price to pay for accountability, but to the cinema I went.\n\nCinematic value: 1 star Theological value: 2 stars Overall rating: 1.50\n\nA stereotypical, dysfunctional family cinema. That is the best way to describe the Steeles of the Left Behind film. Chloe (Cassi Thomson) is the university student with a chip on her shoulder, Ray (Nicolas Cage) is the father who is an international pilot who is considering an affair with a stewardess and Irene (Lea Thompson) is the mother who has become a Christian in the last year. In the eyes of Chloe and Ray, Irene's religious fervour is the cause of family's problems. She talks about her new found faith in Jesus and continually challenges her family to believe in God. Irene's primary reason for earnestly communicating this message is based in her biblical view of the end times, specifically of the rapture. The belief that Christians will vanish from the earth prior to a global tribulation. 'Are you ready?' is the theme of the Irene's questions and of the film. During a trip home to see the family, Chloe is able to see her father as he is about to leave for London and in an interesting twist of events, meets the world-famous, investigative journalist, Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray). Buck and Ray are on the same fated flight heading to London. After seeing her father at the airport and later having an argument with her mother, Chloe is out with her brother at the local shopping centre. In the blink of an eye, the rapture occurs. Ray and Buck are in the air to London, Chloe is left alone to defend herself in New York and the surreal drama begins to unfold. The remainder of the film is played out as the characters manage life through the ensuing chaos and their investigation into what has happened. The harsh realities of life set in as they see how the world has changed in an instant and they need to determine how they will get on with the next few hours, much less the rest of their lives after being left behind.\n\nVic Armstrong is a stunt-coordinator turned director who gets the daunting task of bringing the first book from the Left Behind series to cinemas. To his credit, he only takes on the first few chapters of the original book. Which leaves him with the action side of the rapture, but not the introduction of the new world order. Armstrong only has to manage a handful of characters and a six hour window of time. Also, the signing of Nicolas Cage and Chad Murray by the production team gives this new version of Left Behind some Hollywood credibility. As a performance, Cage does manage to work with what he is given with the limiting script, but that is where the accolades end. The production budget must have been paid to Cage. The remainder of the production was difficult to endure. The script, the effects and the music are poorly initiated. Even within the realm of Christian cinema, this film did not measure up to the the expectation that was conveyed by bringing Cage on board. Based on the multitude of examples of bad production value it would not be gracious and would show poor form even as a reviewer to lambaste this film. It was a struggle to find any redeeming values in this film. At times the audience was laughing because of the awkward nature of the production and not due to any humorous moments. It is best to say that the term 'disaster film' has multi-layered meaning with Left Behind. Two striking thing about the film were the negative portrayal of Christians and the fact that Jesus' name was not mentioned throughout the script. The film distracted from the intentional message of the Bible. This film does not warrant any recommendations and should be avoided.\n\nThe opportunity to have a discussion about salvation through Jesus should be the centrepiece of the conversation. If you are a Christian reading this review, the challenge is for you to evaluate what you believe. Have you taken time to consider what you know about the the biblical view of the end times and how would you have a conversation with someone? Ensure that the conversation is not judgemental, but is based in a personal study of the topic and centred on Jesus. If you are someone who is not a Christian, but find yourself reading this review. Are you interested in finding out more about the Bible, Jesus or Revelation? If you are in Australia, contact City Bible Forum or if you are in the US, contact Saylorville Church. Leaving the cinema... What do I think about Left Behind? I will have to admit that I will have to give two different answers. As a film reviewer, this was a poorly executed film and I would not recommend it to anyone. As someone who looks at every opportunity to talk to people about the Bible and Jesus, if someone chooses to go see the film, let's talk. You will need some clarification and explanation after watching this 'disaster' film.\n\nWhat are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible have to say about the rapture? (1 Thessalonians 4:17, Luke 17: 34- 37) 2. What does the Bible have to say about the end times?\n\nWritten by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews"

        "review_detailed_main": "There are two different scenarios if you watch this film:\n\nIf you are a Christian, you will see a cheesy action-drama that makes disappointing changes from the novel and a spiritual message weaker than Cage's performance.\n\nIf you are anyone else, you will see an awkward action-drama that provides clich\u00e9d end-of-the-world footage along with a preachy, confusing explanation that interrupts the suspenseful moments.\n\nThere are several points where you will have to really stretch your suspension of disbelief. The acting is marginal, Cage is predictably boring, but Buck was a good actor. The CGI is not the worst I've seen, but for 2014, it, along with the set production, definitely feels low budget. The movie's plot and main topic will make it difficult to find an audience, or a sequel.\n\nFX: 3/10 Characters: 5/10 Plot: 4/10\n\nOverall: 4/10 Consensus: If you really want to see this, or are a fan of Nicolas Cage's dull acting at its finest, wait until it comes on DVD. If you are part of a congregation, see if you can get a large group discount at the theater."

I knew I was going to see a crappy movie, but \"crapy\" was not even close to what I just watched. I feel sorry for Nicholas Cage and the movie he was involved in. You can see that Cassi Thomson tries her best to play a good role, but the lines he was given to say and her acting skills are beyond awful. The plot has a lot of gaps, no suspense, nor surprise, characters that you don't even know why they act the way they do. If you are a lame film lover, you might enjoy this movie, otherwise stay away from it, do yourself a favor and put this film in the \"never watch this movie\" list."

Regardless of what your beliefs are, it's just a really terrible movie- with really really bad production values, bad acting, writing,- did I mention how bad the overall production values were for the Cameron film???\n\nWell, this big-budget reboot with big shot movie star Nicolas Cage that came out last year...well, it...it's really bad too! LOL But at least this one has halfway decent production values (sorta?? LOL). This one is just so bad, it's kinda fun to watch in the tradition of those Ed Wood classics like \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\"- movies that were just so bad they were good (okay, I guess you really can't say that about this one..?)\n\nI was reading some reviews from both secular and Christian media groups, and I kept seeing the phrase \"Worst movie ever made\" coming up again and again, so I just had to check this out. Dunno that I'd go as far as to call this the \"Worst Movie Ever Made\" myself, since after all, that Cameron film is still floating around out there-?? LOL One thing that did surprise me was to hear that the author of the original source material, who was not a fan of the first series of films, said that THIS film was the best interpretation of his work yet-?? Well, I guess that means... absolutely nothing..??? LOL Some more has-been actors like Chad Michael Murray and Lea Thompson co-star in this monstrosity.\n\nAnd Nic Cage-????- after a half decade of terrible direct-to-video B- action movies you redeem yourself with a couple good films- \"The Frozen Ground\" and \"Joe\", and then you decide to star in THIS movie-???

We got the screenwriters answers to a couple of 'dillemas' though: It doesn't matter if you are born and raised in a madras school in Punjab and have never even heard of this Jesus-person, without a belief- you are doomed. Also we see the babies and children being 'ruptured'. This is in accordance to some believers, but not all. All mankind are according to this religion sinful from the moment we are born.\n\nThe plot, story,acting everything is utterly crap, and reminds of some daytime-drama created in house by some unnamed cable TV company.\n\nWhat had been 'slightly' interesting if they opted to challenge some more controversial topics, they where 'bold' enough to show that a good Muslim man was left behind, but how about Jews,gay people, liars presidents who bombs other countries, people who use electricity, ,doctors whom perform abortions, cheaters, liars, rich people, judgmental people, people who did not answer hatred with love, people who did not turn the other cheek or people who are well fed (because as we all know, the well fed will go hungry, don't we ??)\n\nCould have been _slightly_ interesting if they went all out and picked more bold subjects on who got raptured and who did not, instead of just atheist, Muslims and people who have performed varied 'sins'. It would of course not be any 'answer' to anything, but a bit more daring.\n\nThis 'movie' is an insult to every religious and non-religious person on this earth with IQ of more than 50.\n\nWeak, cheap and cowardly. Blah.. No go away or I will insult you a second time."

Makes all the poor daytime movies of free channels look great. A waste of 2 hours! Honestly, don't bother. I have it 2 stars as technically it is a movie but woeful. Best scene is drop kicking the annoying little passenger down the chute. Not sure what else to write to fill the required 600 words. A bit like the producers for this so called movie."

The philanderer, the gambler, the drug user, the person who puts money above all, the Muslim, etc. These are very one-dimensional characters and it showed. The acting was atrocious and the conversations did not seem natural but simply scripted prosthelytizing. There were many plot holes and ill-conceived concepts that despite trying to like this movie I couldn't. If I didn't watch it for \"free\" on prime I would ask for my money back like others. Wasted two hours of my life.\n\nOn a side note I doubt even more now that the rapture is scruptural according to this envisioning of it. It makes it seem like God doesn't care about the world or its inhabitants. When they showed a dog on a chain with its owner gone I am like, no loving god would leave that poor dog to likely starve to death..."

A free viewing at a friend's house is even too expensive - bad at too many levels. The story itself is a bad fantasy, with many scenes simply difficult not to laugh, although it portrays a serious spotlight of this fantasy. The story? Difficult to accept and recognizable from early in the movie (the only reason it was expected that more was to come, and kept the viewer stupidly continuing to watch), to \"action\" scenes that failed to provide any realism or redeeming qualities to a poor script. I simply wonder how long it will take Mr. Cage to recover from this mistake."

Will such a possible event happen soon? I believe that to be true. The writing and acting are completely realistic. As Esther said to Miriam as they were leaving the Valley of the Lepers in the 1959 movie, \"Ben-Hur,\" \"The world is more than we know.\" God, Jesus Christ/Yeshua Hamashiach, and the Word of God are all more than we know.

        "review_detailed_main": "I've enjoyed the film, it's been very frustrating to me how negative most people been towards it. It seems that both secular audiences and Christian audiences are usually unhappy with it. But I think I have figured out why. And the answer is actually quite simple- for most of us, if we have something against a movie (or anything else for that matter), we're generally going to hate it no matter how good it is (we focus on the negative, and ignore the positive).\n\nThere are two kinds of movies- secular films and Christian films. And sadly this movie shows that the two types just don't mix. It seems that the filmmakers decided to make an exciting, action packed, Hollywood style film with big name actors in order to attract secular audiences and show them what we Christians believe is coming- the rapture. I'm sure it worked some, but it seems that any scripture is too much for the average secular audience, no matter how exciting the movie may be. If they had portrayed the rapture as science fiction, like alien abduction, it would've had a higher rating. The movie is very exciting and well done- a fact that many people either ignore or refuse to accept because of its Christian aspect. And at the same time, many Christian audiences also dislike it because of its Hollywood style, and the fact that it only has a bare minimum of scripture.\n\nAs a Christian, I've been looking forward to this movie for many years now, longer than any other film. I'm somewhat disappointed with it, but I do still enjoy it, in fact the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it, but I do wish that it had more scripture. Even for the secular audience, I think it would've helped if they had explained the rapture a little more- they give almost no explanation of what it is and why we believe it, other than the fact that it's in the Bible.\n\nI think some Christian audiences also dislike it because it's so different from the books. The original Left Behind movie was very similar to the book. I enjoy it, but they sort of covered too much, they tried to squeeze the entire first novel into it, which didn't exactly work all that well. Ironically, this time it's the exact opposite, only a very small part of the novel is covered, just the first few hours after the rapture. But it's interesting to note that both authors of the Left behind series did not like the original movie, but do like this one. I actually find that somewhat surprising. I'm not sure which film I like better. I do hope they make sequels, but the ratings probably won't be much different."

By the time I was seated to watch Left Behind stepping up to bat in the \"some sort of aeroplane-based disaster\" innings, I was expecting the appeal to have worn off somewhat.\n\nBut oddly enough, it hadn't worn off all that much. Granted I wasn't exactly immersed: the opening wasn't so much tension-building as \"so yeah, is something interesting gonna happen yet?\". And of course the ending, which I won't spoil but regardless don't think actually can't be spoilt, is arguably anti-climatic in comparison to... well, anything.\n\nAnd yet, even as a non-religious viewer, I was not at all put off by the Christian theme - in the same way I can enjoy Harry Potter without believing in magic. Between disequilibrium and conclusion it was fairly well-directed, transitioning between characters at the right times, and reasonably realistic for the given scenario.\n\nThere's not much else to fault. Aside from the acting skills (or lack thereof) of children, Cassi Thompson plays her role well, and you don't even need to give Nic Cage's character a name because he's just Nic Cage in everything these days - which is not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan.\n\nRegardless of your beliefs, by factoring out religion entirely, Left Behind can actually be appreciated (just pretend it's like Harry Potter - anything's possible) and I wouldn't say it's as awful as everyone is making it out to be. A long shot from amazing, yes, but worth a one-time watch nonetheless, and if Cage signs on for the sequels, I'm down. It's not like National Treasure 3 is coming out any time soon."

If you are a Nicholas Cage fan or if you have The Rapture in your mind its worth watching . The song at the credits \"I Wish We'd All Been Ready\" was an early 1970's Jesus Movement song also seen on you tube if you want to hear it in its time. Nice cover of it here. I gave it 8 stars.

Leah Thomson was severely under utilized, she has so much more to offer than just the boring devoted bible pushing mother. This movie seems like it had an underlying (maybe even outright obvious) agenda to push beliefs of god and the bible on the viewers. All disguised as a sci-fi/thriller movie. I gave this movie 3 stars because I wanted to see Nic Cage do what he does best, end the flick with a 'bang'...so I kept watching tilt end, and unfortunately this is clearly a movie that he only did because he 'had to'. No disrespect to Cage, it just wasn't a good movie.\n\nThe ending.. start..and middle are weak at best. Bad CGI (I'm not even one to care about that, but 90's CGI stands up better than this) stale acting, comedic facial expressions during dramatic scenes, and embarrassing writing all make for a complete pile of 'Left Behind'."

Yeah such is the long argument about a so called christian god, you either love him, or you suffer the unimaginably horrible and cruel consequences. I often equate god with a brutal and savage leader of a drug cartel. Because his wrath throughout recorded history has been sever and brutal and devastating, unless you give him 100% of your life. It's an evil message, from an evil faith, and films like this should be banned as they are threatening and scare mongering. Shame on the actors who put their name to this.

Blending science fiction elements with biblical concepts, the script is imaginative yet strongly biblically based. The production is made in the big Hollywood blockbuster style but retains the intimate spiritual power that was originally important to the drama. A fine cast of acclaimed actors give some of their greatest performances and the characters they play are deeply moving. The lovely Lea Thompsen is particularly effective and this is the most fully realized work she has done in years. It is, however, Nicholas Cage who stands out, delivering his best performance since his Oscar winning accomplishment in Leaving Las Vegas. Overall, this is a profoundly powerful film that offers a brilliant interpretation of bible text incorporated into the context of a science fiction event movie format. Not without its flaws, Left Behind is still artistically inspired cinema that is at times simply brilliant and always quite moving."

I suppose writers like Paul Lalonde understand that they don't need to do much better than the barest of minimums in constructing a plot, and they got a career stuntman as their director, which immediately shows that there were problems in pre-production.\n\nBut again, there does not appear to be any effort put into this film or the sequels. No effort was required. The subject matter was intended to immediately alienate neutral viewers while pandering to the overtly religious crowd, who appear to never demand quality in the films that pander to them. Not in writing, not in acting, directing, stunts, special effects, anything.\n\nPathetic, tired performances all around."

Maybe with the first 30 minutes where absolutely nothing happens. It's supposed to introduce us to the characters, make us invested in them. I was hoping they'd all disappear, and that feeling lasted throughout the movie. I can't be bothered to add more, the other 1 star reviews already cover everything. I'm not against people having faith, I don't habour any negative feelings towards Nicholas Cage. This is just a TERRIBLE movie.\n\nI will repeat what someone else said, though: Read the 10 star reviews, they're hilarious. It always makes me feel warm and fuzzy when Christians wish death and destruction on everyone else."

In my opinion just another Airplane-Catastrophe-movie like we have seen so many in the 80s (airport). This movie tries to put a deeper background-story into the \"Airport\"-pattern by inventing some kind of apocalyptic story. Big Fail. Let me please classify this movie as a typical \"B\"-Movie. But what the F*** is Nicolas Cage doing here? If it wasn't for him I never rented that DVD. Totally displaced. I cannot say that I didn't like the story at all, but if traveling in an Airbus A300 Puhleeeze stay in an Airbus and don't change the plane every 5 minutes at the movie.... Let me please go that far stating that the topic of that movie even has potential for a TV-Series. We got many series active on TV with a similar topic. Putting the story of this B-movie into a series actually could be quite entertaining."

All the glowing reviews are proof of that, since many of them make statements similar to \"...when the rapture happens...\".\n\nI rated it an honest 3 stars, because it also isn't the worst movie in the world. Anyone else who has seen The Room, Manos: Hands of Fate, or the recent version of another biblical story, Noah, can understand my reasoning."

        "review_detailed_main": "I found this rendition of the \"Left Behind\" science-fiction religious-pseudo-franchise better than previous ones, ergo, my 5 Rating.\n\nMainly because of the director, \"Vic\" Armstrong, who has been one of the most prolific stunt-men ever, his direction of this little fracas is not bad. Also, the appearances by Nicolas Cage, Lea Thompson, Martin Klebba, and Gary Grubbs almost give this \"film\" a kind of validity. The rest of the actors look like they came from any Neo-Evangelical Rapturistic Vineyard/Calvary Chapel of Southern California. All of the minor actors in this film, probably came from some church group. Possibly from Tim LaHay's home town, El Cajon, California.\n\nRegarding the Rapture, the Bible has this to say about it:\n\nLuke 17\n\n36 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.\n\nNote the word \"Eagles\", Greek \"aetos\" - This is a word used to refer to birds that are carrion-eaters. Also, considering that the original text was written in Aramaic, the Greek is also a translation, so - A more English translation of the verse would be:\n\n36 Two men shall be in the field; one magically disappears, and the other will stand there and gawk. 37 And they answered and said unto him, taken where, Lord? And he said to them, Wherever there is a corpse, there will be carrion- eating birds.\n\nWhich is the standard, accepted meaning of the verse. This is not a verse that tells us that God will magically cart away all of His believers, this is a verse about Judgement. The verse says that the one TAKEN is the one who is in trouble. Those evangelicals who spout \"rapture\" sci-fi theology are basically twisting the meaning of the verse to their own ends.\n\nAs far as this film, you can tell the year something was made by the iPhone 4/4S's and Galaxy III's they are toting around.\n\nBut one thing that was valid, in the whole movie: The Girl \"Chloe\" (Cassi Thomson) really could have given her Pilot-Dad Nic Cage his landing coordinates via her cell phone, even in 2010 when this film was actually made (you can tell by the software on their devices, it's all iOS 5 and Android 4.0).\n\nOther than these little gripes, I enjoyed it, and I was not expecting to. Having the better actors did help a bit. Maybe next time this book is made into film, the Jesusers will step aside and let a real Hollywood movie company make it. This might improve the story, as well as serve the original writers by making a movie that is less offensive to us sinners who have affairs, do drugs, and don't swallow whole any crazy talk about Raptures and stuff.\n\nIronically, this is probably the one review of mine not downvoted simply because I liked it. But I could not in good conscience give this 10 stars."

If your biased or anti anything that is Christian or god centered i would advise you not to see the movie. The movie is based of the book series which are actually very good. Aimed at a specific audience and drags on in some spots. Kept my mom, me and my sister worthwhile. People who say this is the worst movie they've ever seen probably haven't seen that many movies. Wish some things were done differently because it has a great plot."
