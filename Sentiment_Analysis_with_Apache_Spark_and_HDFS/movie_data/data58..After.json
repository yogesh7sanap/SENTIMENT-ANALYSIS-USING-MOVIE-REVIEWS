Well, it had all the ingredients - good girl, bad girls, brooding mysterious college hottie, wannabe college teens sporting nose piercings & tattoos, dysfunctional families & broken marriages..the list will go on. But what trumps all of this the heavyduty emotional texture of the film. The intense romance that develops between Tessa and Hardin in a conventional yet very mystical way. There are not many twists and the narrative is simple. However, it hoodwinks you into feeling that something really uncanny will happen - whether or not it does, is for you to find out. Makeout scenes are aplenty but none OTT. They are aesthetic and complimentary to the storytelling. Director Jenny Gage handles that well with his young, good looking actors keeping their next-door image intact. Audience will relate with their characters and root for both of them. Pace is slow but consistent with moments that will stay with you. Overall, AFTER is the kind of college romance everyone hopes for - it's got love, lust and heartbreak in equal measure!"

The changes that they made were necessary in my opinion and I prefer the \"softer\" Hardin from the movie. The movie has a great message and shouldn't be getting so much hate just because it's not exactly like the books. 10/10 from me. Hoping for a second one! People should watch it with an open mind."

If you haven't, you will not understand the story, since the action is overall really quick, so you don't really understand the scenes or why they are even there. It is boring because 90% of the film nothing much different happens, most of the times is just music playing and Tessa and Hardin kissing and making out. The dialogues are weak, they barely even talk, and if they do, is just hi and how are you. Basically, the characters met and 5 seconds later are already declaring eternal love. No sense at all. The storyline is poor and doesn't respect the film at all. For me, the film killed the book. I feel like the characters didn't show much emotion. Hardin I just didn't feel the vibe. He is really superficial and his personality is just neutral.\n\nPLEASE GO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO WATCH SOMETHING BETTER"

The plot was so bad and all the \"dramatic\" part made me and my friends laugh so hard. We laughed at a lot of inappropriate times like I could sense those angsty teen girl glares. This was a waste of money and time and I would rather bang my head against the wall for 2 hrs than watch it again.

        "review_detailed_main": "So I\u00b4ve read the books. I found them very good despite being \"teenage romance\", because of the complexity of the characters (especially Hardin), the roller-coaster storyline and how you get so sucked into it and feel everything the characters feel. You can actually truly feel how Tessa and Hardin are soulmates.\n\nThe movie though... I totally get that they had to cram everything together and leave stuff out which most of the time when I have read a book and then watched the movie annoys me but still leaved me satisfied. But with this I was too dissapointed. They left out so much that the whole development of the story and their love just felt extremely unrealistic and strange so that it made all of the romantic scenes laughable and weird. I mostly rolled my eyes and cringed as well as most of the theatre did. As soon as Hardin started speaking, everyone in the room burst out laughing because of how monotone he sounded and how weird his lines were.\n\nThey left out so much of the character Hardin, his darkness and pain, the anger and the mood swings. On screen, all that tried to portray it was just him being a bit passive aggressive and cry sometimes. Be a bit moody but it was nowhere near what it could have been. This also made everything lose that deep passion that I think is the reason many people are captured by the books. Not many romantic books capture passion in that way and that\u00b4s what made it unique to me. When they left all of that out though, this just became a bland and boring clich\u00e9 film.\n\nUsually when I watch rom-coms or whatever, I am at least a tiny bit captivated by them or can at least feel some compassion with the characters but this movie didn\u00b4t move me or make me feel anything at all even for a second. Which is sad because when I read the books I cried several times.\n\nThe other thing that I think draws people in by the books is the sexual content. I heard this movie was gonna be the new \"fifty shades of grey\" but the attempt at this being sexual was the lamest I\u00b4ve ever seen. The sexual scenes were so not sexual it was weird that they were even there. And it\u00b4s a shame becasue I feel like the seuxality and the passion and darkness of Hardin was the whole core of this story and they left it all out and made it into just any other love story.\n\nAnd don\u00b4t get me started on the soundtrack.... it was pathetic.\n\nThe one thing I liked was the visuals, they found great fitting characters, I loved the settings and I loved the modern but still retro feeling to it. It was pretty much perfect. But perhaps such a complex story as After can\u00b4t be made into a 1,5 hour film without failure. It\u00b4s too bad though, it could\u00b4ve been great."

Remembering when I was a teenager and feeling those feelings of falling for bad boys.\n\nAfter, did this well. The main female character is somewhat shy, inexperienced and starts college whilst in a longterm relationship with a sweet 17 year old who's more like her friend than her boyfriend.\n\nShe then meets the sexy, intriguing but damaged Hardin, who doesn't date, he just wants one thing. She tries to keep away, but finds herself drawn to Hardin like forbidden fruit.\n\nWhat unfolds is passion, lust and something wicked.\n\nI enjoyed it and am looking forward to the 2nd installment next year. Not really sure why the movie has been met with such criticism and low ratings. Langford does an excellent job, but I don't think that the lead actor brought much chemistry to the story. Yes he is sexy and dark, but acting and chemistry wise, that was the only let down for me.\n\nTurn on Netflix and enjoy this sexy coming of age romance."

There is still so much see and witness from the book and these actors. There is SO much more of the story we love to be told. The books as Tessa & Hardin were written in 2014.. to make it adapt to 2019 there were changes. GOOD changes. And adaptation of the book isn't making it exactly like the book itself, it's taking bits and pieces (important) pieces and making it into its own! I love the curve they took with the film & I would give anything for them to be able to make sequels! What does it hurt anyone to be supportive of something others are passionate about!? I'm proud & in love with this film! I'm angry about people just not being supportive!"

Hope they have second movie and redeem themselves."

But no, instead you only focus on Tessa and Hardin kissing all movie, constantly looks for each other, her sighs...\n\nThe movie itself wasn't worth it to watch because it all happened so fast most of the scenes didn't happened in the books... gosh I'm going to try to forget that this movie ever happened."

Her mother (Selma Blair) hates her new roommates. She is pulled into their party world and the mysterious bad boy Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin).\n\nLangford is a beautiful girl but I would give her glasses to fit the role. Hardin is such a smirking British douche that it's impossible to root for this relationship. It's cringe-worthy how much I dread this movie going forward. The only meet-cute moment comes from the Great Gatsby difference. He needs to dial down the hipster vibe and dial up the bad boy personality. Her high school boyfriend isn't much better either and bookish Landon has no juice. Dread is the defining word for this movie. I'm guessing that this is 50 Shades for teen girls. It's just as bad. The plot is slower than molasses and obvious as F. The dialogue is clunkier than a Ford Pinto but this movie has no possibility of exploding. The breakdown of Jane Austen is simplistic and too broad while trying to be deeply literary. That's part of the clunky dialogue conundrum. It needs to be smart and it tries to absorb the smarts by commandeering literary classics. It fails the comparison. It would be smarter to debate the romantic possibilities of Fuller House. At least, it would be at its own level. With Langford and Tiffin, the movie has two models right out of a catalog. They are unable to deliver more dimensions to these characters. There are way too many montages although the aquarium looks great. This is indeed 50 Shades for teen girls."

This movie does have some enhanced archetypes: the protagonist is a goodie two shows on eleven, her college roommate is met to be the very polar opposite. I mean everything about her scrams unchristian, and the bad boy seems to be just a pretty face with a British accent. But the movie starts to get better. Like the fantasy of the young teen novel seems to wear off and the story becomes very grounded and down to earth as it progresses. I think if I was a teenage women I would have not found it so dull"

Everyone has their traumatic experiences or stories. He's not even a victim of verbal or physical abuse from his family and he acts like his life is the worst... He isn't even seen like a dangerous bad boy how the book portray him. Bad boys are strong, not a whiny baby... He's just an immature jerk and she is a disloyal girlfriend. I don't even understand how her boyfriend wasn't mad at her for betrayal. for accepting to be cheated on. I guess he was really tired of her. That or he had a girlfriend secretly too.

I knew from the start that there was no way the whole book could be acted out into the movie. I went into the theater with an open mind and really hoping for movie that could bring the book characters to life. I knew beforehand that the characters names had to be changed from the Watt-pad version to the book and movie versions. As for the movie... I was disappointed in the fact that the story line was not followed correctly. Certain events in the book happens before others, but in the movie some events were missing. Just a lot of plot holes. Another thing was with Hardin's character. In the book his rude, cold, and demeaning behavior was a key part in the plot line and how Tess and Hardin reacted with each other. Minor details in the book were Hardin having a bunch of tattoos, in the movie there was a lot but not as many as the book portrayed. Another thing about Hardin's appearance was that in the book he had facial piercings which has a key moment in one of the books because he takes them out because they remind him of his past, however in the movie, Hardin's character does not have any facial piercings. It's just some of the minor details that have big meaning in the end that weren't in the movie that really had me disappointed. As for Tessa's character, she acted out pretty good to me, however, in the book she was an English major, in the movie she is an economics major. There are other events in the movie that are around this general idea that wasn't how the book was written, one being Hardin getting the job for Tessa at Vance, but in the movie Ken makes the first move and Tessa ends up emailing Kimberly herself with no help. Tessa, early on in the book, started looking for cars and eventually got one within the first book, in the movie she did not and she rode a bike everywhere. Fights between Tessa and Hardin weren't as violent I guess is the right choice of words as they were in the books. Personally, did not enjoy the movie. It was disappointing in the fact that minor details weren't kept, character development was poor, and the movie itself was rather short and to me felt like it was rushed. If there happens to be another movie, at the moment I don't know if I would go watch it after seeing this one. After isn't after with Zed vs. Hardin, Hardin being rude, cold, and his unruly behavior, Tessa being soft, the BET scene being how it was in the book. After waiting for 5 years now for this to come out, the only words to explain how I felt about it, is thoroughly disappointed."

For people who have read them all as well, I just want to say that it is best to walk into the theater with an open mind due to the fact that it is nearly impossible to fit an entire 600 pages into a film. Some things are changed from the novel and in my opinion I think it is for the best because I will admit...the book can be a little harsh for the big screen BUT 'After' is NOT romanticizing an abusive relationship. It is about two non-perfect people who find each other in the dark and bring light at the end. It's not a fairy tale story but it is a real one. A real life story that needs to be told considering the fact that there are people around the world who, more or less, have the same storyline as Tessa and Hardin. Personally speaking, I believe that everyone (read the books or not) will love this film! It's different from other romance movies and it is something new to people. It will leave the audience lost for words and wanting more for a sequel!!!"

This movie is only suitable for teenagers who are between 16-18 and no more.\n\nThe only scene I'd love to see again is the final scene and the way he apologized."

The plot is trash and it is extremely rushed and once the climax hit nothing happened. There was barely a build up and then it just farted in your face. The acting was so dry and was worse than the acting in a porno. The characters are terribly written. The main character Tessa is the worse version of the cliche \"sheltered virgin girl\" yet and Harden is a craptastic bad boy like holy crap. If you want to watch this movie I would suggest you watch 50 shades instead because at least 50 shades is graphic enough to distract you from the garbage plot. But if you want a good laugh I would watch this movie because it is so bad it's funny."

        "review_detailed_main": "After is a new romantic drama directed by Jenny Gage, the director of All This Panic.\n\nThe film is about eighteen-year-old Tesse Young (Josephine Langford), who will start her first semester at the university as a student. Here she ends up in a whole new world with a way of life that she is not used to. When she meets the mysterious Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), she soon feels attracted to him. In this way they start a stormy relationship together, in which Tesse gets to see life in a different way. In this way she starts to doubt what she really wants to do and achieve with her life. In addition to her personal doubts about life, she also wonders who Hardin really is and what his life looks like.\n\nThis film is based on the book by writer Anna Todd. She came up with this book and wrote it on a website called Wattpad. Her book is actually a fanfiction about Harry Styles, a member of the band One Direction. That this film is based on a fan fiction can also be seen in the characters in the film. The characters come across as stereotype teenagers with an imaginative version of teenage life. The film is full of clich\u00e9s that you have seen in other teenage films before. In addition to the fanfiction of Anna Todd, the film also comes across as a teenage version of Fifty Shades of Gray. This film and book series is also based on a fanfiction, but from the story from the Twlight films and books. If you put these films next to each other, you can see that fanfiction is not something that can really be filmed and can therefore be better kept with the book.\n\nBecause the film is directed and also written by novice people and is furthermore based on fan fiction, the novice cast doesn't have much to work anymore. This can also be seen in the film, because the cast comes across as a fantasy version or very exaggerated teenagers. This way they don't appear credible in the film. Probably only fans of the book or Harry Styles can enjoy this film because the film appeals to them more."

I figured the movie would be better and would be a good way to support it. But my god. TERRIBLE. The \"couple\" were in love in 2 seconds. The viewer didn't have enough time to even process what was happening or WHY. Because there was NO connection and NO plot. Now, I KNOW I'm the \"odd person out\" because a billion people who read the books will disagree, but I'm sorry, I can't lie. For the 65% of the population who live on earth who have NOT read the books. This crap made no sense. NO PLOT. (I'm going to keep saying this, because I've never watched a movie without one before.) However, It was like the director and author (who was highly involved based on all the press interviews with the cast members) decided to take the most popular scenes and just make a movie montage. There was barely any tension or a challenge...just bad. The person I saw it with didn't read the books either and he wanted to walk out like 5 times because he was so bored and confused. We also laughed because some of the scenes were just so terrible. There was one scene where I guess (I have no idea because the way it was cut was so strange) but Hardin was supposed to be doing something sexual to her, but like...they just looked at one another for a few seconds (she didn't even so much as moan so it was super confusing just watching her face stare up blankly at the ceiling) before the scene cut and they were laying in bed cuddling with her pants off. Me and my partner looked at each other in confusion and both whispered: \"Wtf just happened?\" The whole thing was just dumb. There were scenes that could have been cut. Like when she went to the car with that gut and asked where Hardin was. WHY? Why waste 2.5 minutes of film of that when the scene before the viewer (and the actress) were SHOWN the text messages explaining where Hardin would be. Those 2.5 min could have helped the beginning of the film and developed the relationship a bit more before the lake scene (like three scenes into the movie) where they're in love. I just don't understand how the heck they have all these deep feelings toward one another? They knew each other for 2 days max before they were in a lake and he was all, \"I don't think we can ever be just friends?\" Such a confusing and strange film. Surely people 16 and older are smarter than this?\n\nAlso: As a side note I don't understand the BS this movie got before opening day. This relationship wasn't \"abusive\" in the least. Hardin was actually really sweet and the bet wasn't that big of a deal. She fell in love, he fell in love. He cried like a baby in the rain for her. I am NOT going to sit through part 2 of a movie where this chick is going to berate him and for there to be no plot again. NO."

I read them all in a couple of days and fell in love with Hardin Scott. He's a bad guy with piercings and a body full of tattoos. This was my first dissapointment. Even in the movie trailer Hardin looks like the guy next door. Without the black clothes, the leather jacket and nice car he could have been casted for Noah. Although He does have a few tattoos in the movie and what bothers me strongly is the fact that from the little tattoos he's got, he's got a big one on his back. In the books his front size is full of tattoos but his back is plain. In one of the next books this is important. Not only Hardins appearance changed in the movie. I feel like his whole personaIity changed. I get that the movie is pg 13 but they made everything so soft it looses a big part of its story and with it its appeal. Don't get me wrong it's a likeable movie. Tessa is played wonderful. I think if you watch the movie without reading the book you are watching a nice love story. But nothing more. I recommend you read the books first. With everything being so rushed you'll understand everything that's going on so much better. I'm happy I saw the movie but like always: the book is so much better."

This movie fixed everything that I didn't like about the books. For example, it brought a diversity of personalities which you don't see in the books and there were way less \"Tessa crying\" moments, which were so repetitive in the books. HERO played Hardin AMAZINGLY WELL. I never thought they could find an actor who would so closely resemble Hardin--but they did. I remember Hero playing the young Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and I knew instantly that his career would take off when he got older. His ability to play dark, brooding characters is truly phenomenal.\n\nJosephine was absolutely beautiful, confident and strong. She is the Tessa I prefer to the Tessa in the books. Her smile, her eyes, her voice, everything she did was perfect. She LOOKED exactly as I pictured in my head.\n\nFor those diehard fans of After that didn't like it, I truly feel bad. However, movies are never like the books.....take Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings just as a few examples.\n\nThis movie is so romantic and beautifully filmed. It is not a waste of your money so please go see it!!!!!!!!!!!"

Even the fact that Selma Blair is in it is a nice nod to the classic teenage drama. \"After\" is not the same though. It is way less twisted and \"cruel\", but makes for a sweet and romantic Sunday movie. The actors are pretty and talented, and they have good chemistry, which is obviously important for the purpose of this movie. Though \"After\" might be \"the next best thing\", I would really recommend the younger generation to watch \"Cruel Intentions\" too, which is the original and better version of this movie genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is your typical good girl meets bad boy romance, so as for plot twists, can't say there were many. The acting was average at best, but it wasn't like the characters were exactly the most complex to portray, so I suppose the actors did their job. In addition, the characters either fit complete stereotypes or simply did not have any personalities at all. Side note: I refuse to applaud Anna Todd for making the movie \"diverse\". She made Tristan a girl, which would have been interesting had Pia Mia been on the screen for more than 4 minutes. Anyone else getting the same queerbaiting vibes as Riverdale? And representing the African American community with Landon wouldn't have been a problem had he had more duties than being the typical 'black best friend's stereotype.The biggest thieves of the screens were the two main characters, Tessa and Hardin. The movie focused much more on the romance between them rather than them as individual people with separate stories and personalities. For a movie that bragged about encouraging empowerment, they sure made Tessa seem dependent on Hardin and hinted at her being irrelevant without Hardin. I mean, a lot of romance movies are guilty of this, but still, it makes for some pretty unrelatable and boring characters, especially the female lead. Another side note: Josephine Langford is an okay actress, however the producers should have told her that her Australian accent came through way too much and asked her to do the scene again. The editing was a bit odd, including a lot of shots of characters just staring at each other and extreme close ups of body parts and objects. Jenny Gage was way too dependent on montages to save this film. In terms of plot, some of the character motives were lost in the fast-paced nature of the film. Believe me, it was incredibly too fast. This is something that happens a lot in book to film adaptations, since it is very difficult to cram what would be a 10 hour reading session in a 2 hour movie, but still, they could have tried a bit harder. Instead of trying to stuff a film with new scenes that have zero relevance, this movie should have at least tried to include scenes from the book that may have been a waste of time as well but at least they weren't brought out of thin air. This movie was, well, forgettable. Beyond average and disappointing. Overall, it just blends in with the rest of the teen romance genre, if anything being a flop to others in that category."

As someone who has read the books, I can understand the appeal behind the story: ordinary girl who falls in love with troubled and mysterious boy, finally feeling free to engage in an unhealthy romance with someone she barely knows (we all have seen that before). Regardless of my opinion of the story, the film's execution was simply painful. The plot is non-existent, everything happens so fast that you don't have time to understand what these people are doing with their lives, you don't even understand why these people like each other, the main couple has no chemistry at all and even the end that should be shocking does not bring you the least empathy for the characters. It is a story that begins and goes nowhere, since you are left without understanding the attitudes and choices of the characters. Unfortunately, just another book that had a horrible adaptation. Any resemblance to Twilight may not be so much of a coincidence."

They made it out like it was going to be this passionate romance movie but it was just only kissing scenes, nothing like the book. There was a lot of things missing from the book and stuff that they put in the trailer. Honestly, I believe that they tried to not make Hardin's personality like the books because they were worried about the backlash of him being and making it a toxic relationship. It felt like they just jumbled the scenes up and the relationship progressed so fast. I was disappointed becuase I felt like I was watching a sappy teen romance but in the book it's like a erotic steamy novel. I wanted to see more scenes with Zed and Landon. If it wasn't apart of the book I would of liked the movie. It is becuase I liked the books so much and was really counting on it to be more like the book. I was so excited to see this but all they did the whole time was make out and hardly talk. I want there to be a second movie, but done in the right way. A Rated R version"

Fast forward ANOTHER few years, and the story gets a movie deal! I had never been more excited for a movie before in my life. I'll admit, I was very nervous. It's typical for movies to not do books justice. However, the After movie went above and beyond my expectations. I loved every minute of it and every aspect that they added to the story to make it work for the big screen. Sensual scenes and incredible chemistry between its leading actors, I will keep seeing it in cinemas over and over again so that I will definitely get more movies to complete the story of Hardin and Tessa."

Cinematography is excellent. This movie is one amazing experience. People need to detach themselves from the book and should see the beauty of the film on its own. Can't wait for the sequels."

One needs to feel the urge to continue watching, not the other way around. To my unpopular opinion, I actually quite liked the characters, and did feel the chemistry between Hardin and Tessa. Realistically, the film could not have replicated every single detail from the book but, if they had created a TV show, letting each character and each scene develop and serve its effect, the work would have been much better."

Towards the ending it almost feels like film was rushed to end.

I was completely engulfed in the romantic relationship but more importantly by how Hero and Josephine were BOTH able to portray those strong emotions so effortlessly. They both are great actors and take their craft SERIOUSLY. I certainly hope we see more. Also, the soundtrack for this movie was PERFECT, sometimes you get a good soundtrack and you watch the film and it seems the songs dont \"match\" the scene you're looking at, but that was not the case at all!! Honestly, it's very evident the hardwork that went into this movie by everyone! Congrats to Anna, Hero, Josephine, Khadijah, Shane and just the whole gang!!! #proudafternator"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is the most clich\u00e9 movie I've ever seen. A clich\u00e9 movie can be good. But, this movie definitely is one of the worst. It succeeded in nothing. I wonder if this will even make enough money to cover its budget. It's obvious that this was made as a money grabber, but I think that it's stupidity will stop it from even being a money grabber. First off, sometimes the screenwriting and directing can be bad, but the acting can somewhat save the movie. This movie definitely doesn't do that. All the actors and actresses in this movie show how bad a person can act. This made me feel like I was watching a B-rated movie(obviously it was one). The guy who plays the role of Hardin shows how someone with only looks can be in a movie. His acting makes me feel like I someone is spitting acid into my eyes. Whenever he says something, I could feel the awkwardness. Was that in the script? No. It's clear that this character is supposed to be some \"cool\" and \"interesting\" character. All this actor shows me is how awkward acting can be. In fact, the there is no chemistry between any of the characters. Hardin and Tessa? No. Tessa and her mom? No. Tessa and every other character? No. Hardin and every other character? No. Every time there was an interaction between any characters, I felt as if they were reading off a script. Obviously they were, but an actors job is to make that seem impossible. Their job is to make the audience believe what they're watching. Nothing in this movie felt realistic. Nothing in this movie made me interested in it.\n\nSecond, the plot was just a disaster. For example, it was no surprise that they would do a truth or dare game and it'll be revealed that the main girl is a virgin. It was no surprise when her mom came into her dorm when the two were making out. It was no surprise that the the guy started to date the girl as a bet. It was the plot of some 10 year old's fan fiction. Even a 90 year old grandpa could write a better teen romance than this. The screenwriting was written in a mess. Why? The screenwriter's job is to show the audience what the characters feel. Their job is to make these characters not one dimensional. Every character should have a motive. Yes. Even the sub characters. If you want to make a great film, every character should be filled with emotion and motives. The first character that makes absolute no sense is Tessa. She is written to be a goody two shoes girl that turns into a \"I-Lost-My Virginity\" girl. Now if they really wanted to make the main character a clich\u00e9 character, they should've gave her depth. No, they do the exact opposite. She is seen to become a bad girl just because she meets the boy. That's exactly it. There's nothing special about him. He just falls in love with him and feels like she should become rebellious. It's actually pretty idiotic. She's the most one dimensional character I've ever seen on screen. Now Harden is just a guy. A guy that has an English accent and is mysterious. That's it. He's just there to show how what love is to the main girl. I could go on like this to every character in this movie because that's how problematic the screenwriting is.\n\nIn conclusion, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I regret spending 8 dollars on this. It's worth nothing. I can't believe some people would watch this movie and think that it's actually watchable. If anyone would want to watch a movie with no plot, no depth in the characters, no sense in anything, I would recommend this movie. Absolute disaster of a movie it truly is."

I myself wish I never lost my virginity so young especially to such a loser quite like this here main male character. I wish I had had more fun in college, partying even, but mainly learning more about myself and made more friendships. I wish I didn't waste it on some relationship I thought was \"love\" and just continued to explore and grow as an emerging adult woman. Thankfully, I did meet my husband towards the end of school and I've been married 9 years with 2 beautiful daughters so I can't complain too much. But really I still have regrets and I feel like a few of them played out in this film. Too much time wasted chasing a toxic relationship that only amounted to pain. Also, Teen romance? Really?

But I liked the songs during the movie. I don't think there is going to be a second part."

The movie was really interesting to me and I didn't feel board thoughout the whole thing. The movie and the book are very different to each other but still similar to each other in another way which was a nice new take on the story. The new scenes that were added in the movie were really cute and fun to watch too. I think both Hero and Josephine did a great job in portraying Hardin and Tessa. Josephine is really what I pictured Tessa to look and be like and her acting was enjoyable. Hero was amazing!! I loved his portrayal of Hardin Scoot I thought he did a fantastic job even though Hardin was a lot more softer in the movie than in the book which didn't really please me and a fan of the book but I felt it worked well with the story line of the movie. However even though I enjoyed the film sooooo much as a fan of the book I feel like some characters weren't played to their full potential in the movie my main concern was the absence of Zed's infatuation with Tessa which was very much present in the books but not in the film. The other characters also didn't get much screen time in the movie which was a shame as you couldn't see their true personalities but none the less I still enjoyed the film very much and I hope that there will be a sequel to the movie as there is a lot more to the story of Hardin and Tessa"

It definitely had a lot of potential, and I feel like they could have made the movie longer so that people who haven't read the book would understand what was going on because their love story felt rushed at the beginning. However, I really want them to make a second film and focus on keeping the relationship complicated. This film didn't really have any fights scenes, and I feel like it was a big part of what made their relationship so complicated. They definitely needed to expand the Hardin's character more so the viewers could see why Hardin was the way he was. Either ways, I loved the ending and overall the film left me feeling happy."

The passion between the two main characters was non-existent and all the lines were extremely cheesy and unbelievably hilarious. Instead of falling in love with the characters and their relationship, I was laughing at them. This film was a let-down, the only good scenes were the beautiful nature shots. If I saw this film at home I would stop watching it after 20 minutes. After saying all that, I can image a 14-year-old me enjoying this film.

        "review_detailed_main": "I loved this movie. Yes there were changes from the book, but there is a huge difference in how much you can include in a book vs. a movie. I think the changes were great and those who have read the book need to go into the movie with an open mind. I had a friend accompany me who has never read the book and she absolutely loved the movie and how relatable it was, especially to her college experience freshman year. Sure, there were some things I wish were included and I wish there could've been more time to explain certain things, but like I said there is only so much you can include in a movie adaptation. I think the changes benefited the movie for an overall audience to make it appeal to everyone, and not just book readers. There absolutely NEEDS to be a sequel, especially with the way the movie ended. 10/10 for acting and chemistry, loved the leads. 10/10 for the whole movie. would 100% recommend."

I just wish it wasn't pg13 I want it rated R but you have to read the books there amazing!!! I fell in love after reading it and couldn't stop reading the series. I'm sure the second movie will be so much better because it will be rated R and I'm sure they'll show us another side of Hardin. His anger & the love they have for each other!"

I have read the books, and although they cannot compare to similar young adult series such as the mortal instruments, divergent or the hunger games, there are some obvious real world characters and problems, which I at least thought the movie would address. I was extremely disappointed with the movie, not just because the actual essence of the story was lost, but there was no depth to the characters or the story whatsoever. The plot jumped all over the place, which made it extremely hard to follow, the cinematography was strange in parts, and the scenes did not flow from one to the other. I think this is another unfortunate book adaptation which will most likely be forgotten due to its poor execution much like vampire academy or Percy Jackson. Can't see this getting a sequel and I am confused by all the perfect reviews, because it certainly wasn't anywhere near even a good movie."

Boy, that's an understatement. The characters were flat, the story was rushed, they changed the storyline in a way that really didn't make sense. One could say \"how do you get a over 100 chapter book into one 1.45min movie?\" well, by actually adding stuff from the second book as well, of course. It doesn't Make sense. They left out crucial plot points that would have made the movie much more interesting. And then the fact that half the movie consists of slow motion, making out/'romantic' scenes that are boring us to death. Sure, I'm not the intended age group, 21 is a bit old for a young adult movie, but there are movies of the same genre I still enjoy. The only good thing I can name is the casting. This should mever have made it to the cinemas."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every time there is a movie adaptation of a book, there always seems to be the same kind of comments, talking about the little insignificant differences. Entering the cinema, I had in mind there would be several differences and adaptations, so I obviously didn't feel bothered by the dress that changed color, the teacher that was no longer a man, the same sentences said in similar words. I had previously read the book, and am aware that there was a severe backlash due to the portrait of a toxic relationship and its romanticisation towards a very young audience, therefore the need to take away the violence, the heavy vocabulary and the sexual scenes was found when remaking the story. The problem seems to be that without Hardin's dark side, childhood traumas, abusive behavior, without Tessa's emotions on her skin, stubbornness, and without the fights driven from their personalities clashing, both the characters and movies are left shallow. There is nothing to them. The secondary characters were also not handled properly. In the book series, there is a very dynamic interference of this characters on the main story line, leaving loose ends on the beginning to be found i the end, providing new levels of depth to the story. The movie however failed of both subjects, lacking total content, becoming just one more \"teenage\" movie with a cliche romance that will be forgotten in months. When a story is taken by another artist and put in a new medium i expect to see a new take on it, to see how this new artist felt so captivated by the book that they had to bring it to life. Nevertheless, Susan McMartin, responsible for the script, failed. The whole movie felt rushed, leaving the viewer confused on the story line. There was a lot to be explained in this movie, and it certainly wasn't said nor shown. The scenes lack correlation, making the viewer believe the whole story happened between five conversations made of small talk, showing itself to be very unrealistic. The acting left a lot to wish for, the best performance was delivered by Josephine Langford (playing Tessa Young), however, none of the actors were able to give a truth sense of their characters, lacking versatility and depth. And the characters themselves, when stolen most of its traits, became very flat and stereotypical. Molly is simply \"the bitchy/slutty girl\", a if there is nothing left to her but who she wishes to sleep with, and some mean comments (this is something I find disturbing in the book as well.) Even the main characters became a rude boy and a studious girl. In conclusion, I must admit i wasn't expecting this movie to be good, due to the circumstances in which it came to be, and the budget i imagined was on the table, and I was correct. The movie stripped away all the essence of the books, portraying only the most superficial layer of the relationship, and still doing it in an awkward choice of scenes and dialogue."

It's an easy movie to watch if you're not trying to be a critic and not comparing it to the books.\n\nThe casting of the main characters is perfect. Some of the secondary actors need a few acting classes though. The script isn't the best but not terrible either. I am glad I read the books after (hehe) because I probably would have hated the movie because it deviates so much. In the books Hardin is a violent asshat, I don't think they depicted his darkness as well as they could have. Tessa is more of a spitfire in the books. They didn't capture the extent of the passion and the push and pull of their relationship. The movie was so PG that I had NO IDEA that the books were romance novels with descriptive sex scenes until I started reading. So that says a lot about how much they missed the mark on a book adaptation. But despite all the flaws, I genuinely enjoyed it for what it was."

Well, I decided to give it a try. Maybe I had misunderstood the story - I had to give it a second chance.\n\nNo such luck. The movie is simply put as bland as it gets, chemistry took the day off and character development was a no-show. Protagonists go from who are you, to hi, to you are the most important thing in my life and I would give up everything for you. There is no way to believe them. I cannot even say 'Yeah, it also glorified abuse, just like the books', because the plot is so flat that there are no emotions anywhere. There was a group of teenage girls sitting behind me, during the first 20 minutes they kept swooning and whispering 'OMG, I love him!', and I wondered how the ameba on screen had elicited that feeling. I happened to come across them in the ladies room after the screening and they seemed pretty upset the movie was 'that bad'. So yeah, I'm not the intended audience, but clearly the intended audience did not buy into the story either.\n\nI will avoid spoilers, but basically, if you read the books you will find they decided not to include the event/object that drove the whole plot of the first book. I can understand why that is absent -I mean, again, abuse-, but that also means the main driver is AWOL. That leaves you wondering what the whole fuss was about - nothing happens."

        "review_detailed_main": "To be fair, my friends and I went to see this movie as a joke, with the goal in mind of verbally tearing it to shreds. So yeah, my expectations were pretty low going into it. But, unfortunately, it wasn't even one of those movies that's fun to hate on; it's just awful. What else could you expect from a movie that originated as Harry Styles fanfic?\n\nI'm not gonna go into too much detail about this dreadful snoozefest, since it's probably all been said already, and honestly I've spent too much time thinking about this movie already. That being said, the acting is subpar, the romance is terrible, the plot is plain stupid almost the whole way through, the dialogue is utterly cringeworthy, and despite the fact that it was marketed as being steamy and sexy, there ends up being exactly one (1) sex scene-and it was quite possibly the most vanilla sex scene ever put to film. The list of grievances goes on and on.\n\nThe only things that save this movie from a one-star rating are the aesthetics and the ending. Yeah, not much effort was put into this movie, but at least there was some clear effort in the visuals department, as it's actually a decently shot movie with some nice visual moments. And the (slight) twist ending may be stupid, but at least it's kind of emotionally engaging. Plus, the movie at least ends on a somewhat melancholy note, instead of forcing in a cheesy happy ending, which would have just been adding insult to injury.\n\nUltimately though, if you're looking for a terrible movie to watch with friends and make fun of, \"After\" is not it. You'd be better off watching literally any B-grade sci-fi flick; at least then you'd have fun while watching it.\n\nReally, the only good thing that came from this movie is that it won several Teen Choice awards, confirming what we already knew: the Teen Choice awards are meaningless."

This definitely wasn't a good movie, but I genuinely enjoyed it because I'm a sucker for these type of movies. It's a very easy watch, and you can totally tell it's based off of a Harry Styles fanfic. It reminded me of Twilight in a lot of ways.\n\nThe acting was super poor but, for me, this added to its charm. The characters were very stereotypical and the interactions between them were so unnatural and strange, also very cringeworthy. The line delivery was incredibly overdramatic too.\n\nThe cinematography was genuinely quite impressive, which I didn't expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. There were some nice shots and the colour palettes were pleasing on the eye! Also, every shot was well lit and it was easy to see what was going on.\n\nThe music cues added to how cheesy the film was, and were very abrupt at points. However, the tracks used certainly fit the tone of the film well and added some emotion to specific scenes which I appreciated.\n\nThe pacing was messy and it was structured weirdly, but I still found it to be engaging and it definitely wasn't boring. The plot was stereotypical and the whole story was predictable, but I kind of loved it because of this! It starts with a cheesy opening, and escalates quickly, then has a clear ending and follows the theory of equilibrium. I had a great time watching, and that's what matters to me!"

After learning it started as fanfic, I realized it was very similar to Twilight and 50 shades which also started out as fanfic and based in the Settle, Washington area. Not to mention the sex scenes got more explicit with each film.

Although I have to say I was disappointed and angry that the director along with the writer missed this great opportunity to make an astounding movie from such great content from the book.\n\nSadly, the storyline written in the book is involved in the slightest, which I think was a huge mistake. Everything that makes \"After\" After was cut out and replaced with scenes that might look like they've been cut out from some Instagram filter - fantasy world, but doesn't move the plot further or doesn't do anything to help develop the characters as well. I feel like there have been so many scenes that weren't finished or just simply weren't important. I think that this movie could have been so much better if they just stuck to the book more strictly.\n\nAlso, the characters development wasn't as great as I thought it would be, I mean the actors' features did resemble the ones, you would imagine from the book, but the acting and playing had its flaws. It was maybe because both of the actors have so little experience or just simply weren't able to perform the characters correctly. For example Tessa in the book is more overthinking things, not just jumping into things 2 seconds after Hardin says it, and on the other hand, Hardin is much ruder and mocking, seductive.. than in the movie.\n\nAlso I simply just don't understand why they decided to label this movie with PG-13 when half of the book is contained from sex scenes or intimacy. This was another thing that disappointed me the most.\n\nAlso, I feel like the whole movie would have been much more realistic if they showed us more dramatic scenes like the intense arguments between Tessa and Hardin, the flaws of their toxic relationship and also the complicated past of Hardin's which led him to be the way he is.\n\nFrom my point of view, this movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen, but if I recall it today, I can't even remember the plot, I mean nothing really happened in there. The scenes were beautiful and all, but it just seemed so unrealistic. It felt like if I was watching the trailer for 1 hour and 46 minutes."

Or the 50 shades one - the latter being a direct result of the former (if you don't know yet, you can find out exactly how) - and I assume some will make comparisons to Twilight with this too. If they are really legit is a different question. The vibe and feeling is there for sure.\n\nThe movie overall is predictable too. It's the love triangle thing. With the hunk of a man (or still a boy? I did not check the ages the characters are supposed to be), who is equal parts strong and also someone who loves a good book. A rebel with a pose - I mean a book. Actually a lot of books. That he has read - and someone who knows how to push the buttons of a woman. While simultanously be patient enough to wait for her to be ready for him ... a dream come true.\n\nAnd yet something that can also be described as a nightmare. Especially considering the twist towards the end. I have to admit, I did not see it coming - especially because I was not really trying to figure anything out while I was watching this cringe fest of a movie. On the other hand I am not supposed to be the target audience anyway - so there goes that.\n\nStill a few decent actors and that twist made this stand out a little bit. And one can have fun with all the cliches that are thrown your way. There is even some fire when it comes to the love making process, though it is as tame as possible - again for the supposed target audience. Which does change for the sequels - and is not the only thing that is changing. But more on that in a different space."

        "review_detailed_main": "After waiting so long for this film, my hopes were high. As all the fans of the 'After' book series by Anna Todd know, the book is filled with sex, love, lust and much more. It's a shame the movie lacked this completely. The fans were left hanging after being fed behind the scenes photos and videos that left us reeling for the movie to be released. First of all, the movie storyline didn't make sense. They took out so much of the work that Todd had written herself it didn't have the structure that's vital for any film involving love, especially Tessa and Hardin's. One part that particularly stuck out to me was the argument they had in their English lecture. If it followed the original storyline, where they had kissed at the frat party, it would have made more sense. Or even if they placed this scene after the all important 'lake scene'. The scene was poorly placed, however it was executed generally well, which made the story hard to follow. As well as this, the movie moved way too fast. If you hadn't read the books before viewing, you would struggle to make sense of much of the film. Another thing is the lack of sex, of course it is PG rated but when the original premise of the book was based on 'the sexual awakening of Tessa Young', it should never have been PG rated in the first place. The lack of sex stood out to me because the first book followed the story of how Hardin had taught Tessa all these things about sex after finding out she was a virgin and taking her virginity, for her to find out at the end of the book that it was a bet. They changed the bet completely in fact, so it was about making Tessa falling in love with him. I loved this book because it was daring, dangerous, different and it made me blush reading the detail that Todd put into her writing, the movie made me cringe. All these changes turned it into your typical teen love story, which we've all seen before. A final thing was the difference between the 'book Hardin' and 'movie Hardin'. They are not even the same character. Hardin was dangerous, seductive and sexy in the books, in the movie he was a teenager with mood swings. The way Todd had written Hardin made us want him even though we knew we shouldn't, we had a love/hate relationship with him. He is a main character and he arrives to turn Theresa's world upside down, but he was sweet to Tessa from the beginning. There was no point where I was saying 'get away from him girl!' to the screen like I did with the book. He was a complex character that should've been easy to portray for a talented man like Hero Fiennes Tiffin, however I fear that the struggle to translate Hardin Scott from paper to screen had to do with the director Jenny Gage. She said that she wanted the film to be safe for her teenage children to watch. Well guess what Jenny? You did it; but in the process you destroyed the artistry that Anna Todd created and after fans will never forgive you for that. Brilliant books - I recommend them 100%. However hold off on the film for now, from what I hear Jenny Gage is off the case and Anna is working on After We Collided (Book 2) with a new team."

I'm going to be honest here and say the movie wasn't what I expected but it was still so rememberable. For being such a short movie (about 1 hour and 40 minutes) there was a lot included and felt a bit rushed at times but I loved it. The movie was left open ready for plot and character development and hopefully we will be able to see our movie improve and development. The hessa scenes were cliche in some ways but were so adorable and their chemistry was amazing. Most of the acting was amazing and most of the characters fitted so well with the actor/actress. I really recommend that you watch it with an open mind and don't expect it to be much like the book. I have faith in Anna and her team that they will develop the second movie and possibly add more details and scenes from the book. I think Anna and her team did an amazing job on the first movie and they can only improve from here on out. It's disappointing that the UK haven't got the movie but I'll be sure to watch it on Netflix when it officially comes out in my country. Thank you Anna Todd. Can't wait for the other movies and hope they're more like the books."

A no no for me is when you change one of the main characters, they are part of the reason as of why people fall in love with stories in the first place, so why change them?

How do you expect people to engage in the story when they saw each other like first or second time and immediately after there was a scene in a class where they were arguing about the characters, which was meant to be hidden arguing about each other? but. they. met. twice. A big no no for me. 3/10 is for the music and because I liked the indie vibes."

I would've loved more time on screen with other characters, but I know they will be there if a sequel is done. All the important things are there, they had to make some adjustments, but having Anna Todd as a producer and very well involved in the movie making has it's advantages, so I know anything and everything that is needed in the movie to project the core of the story will be there.

However, the story is diluted, and the film's pacing is erratic. This makes it impossible for the audience to invest in the characters and their journey.\n\nThe acting is weak, and both Langford and Tiffin fail to deliver a convincing performance. This lack of authenticity only further detracts from the viewer's ability to relate to the characters.\n\nDirector Jenny Gage missed the opportunity to make the movie meaningful and empowering. Instead, the film promotes toxic relationships and cheating, portraying them as romantic.

Its weak plot, bad acting, and misguided message make it a complete waste of time.

A group of twelve years olds next to us who bursted into laughter everytime a kiss was a little more intense and when they saw a condom didn't really help to create a romantic atmosphere. But at the end of the day it is a movie for them. For a teen girls who weren't in love yet, who still live in their dream world, who still have their whole love life ahead of them. Otherwise I don't believe anyone else is really going to really enjoy this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the (disturbingly) popular Wattpad story of the same name by Anna Todd, After is the result of One Direction fanfiction gone wrong. How this received enough of a following to warrant a $14 million film adaptation is beyond me. There are so many screenwriters with high quality work but are rejected in order to please horny preteens. That, friends, is where Hollywood done messed up.\n\nTessa Young has always been pressured to be the perfect daughter by her mother, and when she gets to college, she meets bad boy Hardin Scott and becomes frustratingly infatuated with him while still with her high school senior boyfriend Noah. Following the generic approach, Noah discovers Tessa's infidelity and breaks things off, leaving her able to pursue the moody, emotionally constipated Hardin.\n\nThe rest of the so-called plot falls more in line with 50 Shades of Grey with some Cruel Intentions mixed in than anything else. For what little it's worth, the actors do a fine enough job with what they're given. Josephine Langford is a lot like her elder sister Katherine (Hannah Baker) but more apathetic. Hero Fiennes Tiffin (nephew of Voldemort), perhaps because of his aforementioned emotionally clogged leading man, makes the viewer, or at the very least me, feel gross. Fortunately, the two leads are roughly the same age.\n\nThe music is as basic to any mediocre teen romance flick, but this time, there's a bland cover of Avril Lavigne's unforgettable \"Complicated\". It's well-made, although it doesn't deserve it. Everyone involved deserves better. Maybe not the writer or director though."

The Soviet film \"Girls\", which was released already in 1962, also stepped on the same rake! I can't believe that for almost fifty years the creators of melodramas have not realized that people tend to argue about love. Not everyone, but it is common. And to take such disputes seriously is a big stupidity. In addition to the plot, a very banal and unreliable problem of parents and children in its outdated, irrelevant appearance is being pulled up. This is already the trouble of the entire American cinema - for some reason, it is in the USA that generational conflicts are adored to be touched upon in every convenient film."

Josephine was also The most amazing and perfect Tessa we could have gotten, and their CHEMISTRY! It's really something you have to go and see for yourself. The main problem I had was the editing. I really hope we get some kind of extended cut or something on dvd because there were parts where it would skip to the next scene and it was confusing at times. For someone who hasn't read the books they would have no idea what was going on. So hopefully for the sequel *fingers crossed* the editing is better. Overall I would recommend going and seeing this in my opinion the Story is still there, but we need to have the other movies in order to fully develop it."

Also, - just a quick note- the fact that this movie won three Teen Choice Awards beating The Hate U Give and Bohemian Rhapsody, seriously makes me doubt the ability of the voters to differentiate a good movie and its production value. It's obvious that the 14 million dollars used for making this film went to hiring two good looking actors to distract us from the horrible plot or just to buy the hopelessly romantic 10 year-olds voters. All that I can say is that I liked Hero better in Harry Potter. XOXO gossip girl"

The events of this film are played out in a way I don't think I have ever seen before in a romance movie. Hardin and Tessa's love completely transforms the idea of a cliche love story. This is not just your typical bad boy good girl romance. Finally a romance movie portrays the complexity of two people pulled together by how different yet achingly similar they are.

        "review_title": "Somehow a worse film than Twilight",
        "review_detailed_main": "I never thought I'd see the day where a film I am watching is more cringeworthy than Twilight. But alas, here we are. Starting out with some bad dialogue we always here about Pride and Prejudice from a literary standpoint, Tessa Young and Hardin Scott discuss the viewpoints of the characters and argue over Tessa's love life. It doesn't take long to see Hardin Scott is a simple down-scale version of Edward Cullen without any supernatural powers. Hardin is creepy from the get-go.\n\nWhile the story description sounds interesting on paper, and maybe the novel was good the film itself plays out like a badly written fanfiction. It is not well executed and each line of dialogue screams rookie. It looks like Jenny Gage is a first time director and writer and although she had some help this screenplay and film fails to inspire. It has no spark or substance in the material and the acting is stiff as a wooden board. Josephine Langford bares a striking resemblance to her sister Katherine (13 Reasons Why) but that's all she got from her. Katherine has talent but Josephine gives off zero emotion. Her acting has no range and all her scenes in the film aren't worthwhile.\n\nDuring the scene where Tessa learns the truth of the nature of her relationship, the film is supposed to be reaching its peak of plot. However, the film is forgettable and leaves no lasting impression. In scenes for Twilight, there are moments that you cannot forget. Even with the horrible acting of Robert, scenes are given substance and although the film is terrible there are memorable moments. Tessa is a poorly written character in the sense that you cannot relate to her. It is unbelievable that she has lived this dull life and the friends she has are even more unbelievable. This literature is offensive in the way that these characters are meant to be so linear and one-dimensional so you cann easily find a way to relate to them. But there's nothing to relate to when it comes to Hardin since he's a basic stalker. But he's a bad one.\n\nI found myself wondering what I was really watching nearly every minute passing. The inclusion of Selma Blair and Peter Gallagher to try to show some actual credible talent goes off without a moment's notice. Screen time for both is so little it's almost a cameo appearance for each. It's a shame that the source material is executed so badly. A good idea is salted by the bad acting."

        "review_detailed_main": "I hope teens will not think of this movie as a representation of what love is. Half the movie was make out scenes and it was implied that there was character development, but it wasn't believable because by the end of the movie the guy still looked at the girl as if she was a piece of meat instead of someone to be loved. I didn't see any \"chemistry\", just sexual desire. Maybe if some of the sex scenes were replaced with the characters spending time to interact with words then there would be more space for character development to show. Also the girl fell for the guy wayyy to easily, like how are you gonna fall for him without even knowing him first. I only gave it 5 stars because I liked the overall storyline, but I don't think the directors imagination and what they were trying to convey on screen matched up. I can see where they were trying to go with it, but as the audience I didn't feel connected to the main character because of the little time spent on showing what her character was like before dating Hardin, but I guess the movie IS called \"After\" so it makes sense lol."

I loved almost every scene but the best one to me is Tessa's escape from the party straight into Hardin's room. It captures emotions from the book like no other scene and if they had left the seductive book sliding, it'd have achieved cult status. The only real love scene is shot and portrayed close to perfection, beautiful, dreamy and should have been longer to justify all else left out. This movie left me wanting more."

        "review_title": "After seeks to please only fans of books. But, you run the risk of not being able to please even this audience. It is uninspired, and driven in automatic mode",
        "review_detailed_main": "For centuries, the search for great love has guided authors of all kinds, from Shakespeare and his Romeo and Juliet to Emily Bront\u00eb with Wuthering Heights. In the face of so much abundance, the writer Anna Todd doesn't even try to dare in After: the proposal here is to reinvent the wheel, adapting a beaten story for the present day while splashing references here and there, to support it. And this is not a demerit, such is the honesty transmitted to the viewer, even though comparisons and similarities are inevitable. The first one, wide open, is in relation to Fifty Shades of Gray. Not so much because of the spicy climate of the sexual saga created by E.L.James, but because of the conception of the female protagonist: Tessa Young - pay attention to the surname, not by chance! - it is the exact copy of Anastasia Steele, be it for behavioral naivety, angelic costume or even purified virginity. Her counterpoint is Hardin Scott, whose booklet also follows the basic stereotypes to the letter: rebellious, elusive air, an exotic beauty a la James Dean, with a hint of devourer that echoes in relation to sex.\n\nOverall, Jenny Gage's film strictly follows the formula for winning over teen audiences; however, for those who are already used to the subtext of the genre, there is not much to add by not leaving the common place and presenting uninteresting characters. Tessa is sweet, modest and responsible, the product of the firm education of an authoritarian mother. At university, she meets her roommate, Steph (played by rookie Khadijha Red Thunder), a funky party girl who turns out to be the opposite of Tessa. It is Steph who presents to the protagonist his objective for the film: the sensitive, closed, tattooed, literary lover, handsome and bad boy, Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin, \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\"). The problem is that Tessa's story is so simple and sweet that any expectation of accompanying the feature with richness or depth needs to be reduced to zero if she wants to consume it with any possibility of fun. The universe of \"After\" is created from the perspective of an immature girl, who had a repressed adolescence, only that the new phase of the student remains a simplified version of a dream world, which includes the personification of an ideal boy in the role of Hardin. Everything is very shallow and reduced to stereotypes in this story and, considering its conception as \"work done by fans\", it is difficult to expect more than that.\n\nHowever, this success comes side by side with a controversy: the abusive relationship. Hardin and Tessa's romance is filled with controversial moments where the young man abuses the girl's psychological condition by verbally assaulting her, taking various extremely toxic actions and being quite explosive. In the film, and here is the positive point of this adaptation, it was all softened. Here, their relationship is modified so as not to have a negative impact in the same way that the books did and still do today. Hardin continues to have an explosive personality, but does not directly affect Tessa. He is very controlled, and his explosive moments happen while the girl is not around.\n\nNovels aimed at the female audience have as their elements escapism and the representation of a perfect world, without any commitment to the reality of different human types. Tessa represents that ideal point of view. Her romantic partner likes books as much as she does, she is sexy and attractive, she suffers from problems like hers, treats her gently, respecting her wishes, represents the independence she seeks and, at the same time, cares and protects her. The development of this relationship serves Tessa's pure interest, without any surprises or difficulties. Even the sacred book for fans of this genre of stories, Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\", appears as a recurring reference in \"After\" as winks for her audience saying \"this film is for us\".\n\nAs a cinematographic work, the absence of risks that history takes also impacts its look. There is nothing that at least tries to get you out of mediocrity. The clich\u00e9s of this format are all there: the drama in the rain, the lust of the \"wet\" characters in a lake, the narrated voice that begins and ends the film. Furthermore, even considering the target audience, it is also impossible to ignore the average performances. For such a proposal to work, the ability of the chosen couple is crucial - and at this point, there is a certain dichotomy. If Josephine Langford, in addition to exuberant beauty, shows resourcefulness when composing a Tessa that alternates between such different moments, from almost emotional closure to absolute surrender, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin has an impressive interpretive nullity. If the couple has a good time, a lot is thanks to the direction of Jenny Gage in the more \"spicy\" sequences.\n\nThe weak dialogues and some unusual paths in the script. The dialogues, incidentally, instead of moving the audience, cause only involuntary laughter. It is difficult to take their romance seriously when everything seems to have been taken from the first ideas that came from the director and screenwriter. They don't try to give the story a visual pop, just like, for example, Fifty Shades did. The material is precarious, and something was needed to make the experience with the film not as tiring as possible. As much as the feature is not intended to be a reflective and profound novel, it presents some details of the narrative that are already more than saturated in the genre - such as the rejected girl who sets up a plan to separate the protagonist couple (with the right to faces and mouths when you see them passing together) and the old speech resource \"things were like this before I met you, but then everything changed\" (which I leave in the air to avoid spoilers).\n\nIt is also necessary to highlight some scenes that try to create a climax without much sense - as in the sequence in which Hardi leaves Tessa alone to meet friends at Bob's after a fight, or when the protagonist stops in front of the mirror (to the sound of a version more melodic of Avril Lavigne's Complicated) and begins to put on makeup and separate clothes that are different from his style so that, in the end, it gives absolutely nothing; or in the ridiculous scene that Tessa cuts her finger on the glass. More than ten songs were used over the course of an hour and forty minutes of film. The impression that remains is that this scene only exists because they wanted a moment to highlight the music and that's it, like a video clip in the middle of the film. In order not to be cruel in the extreme, the scene involving the couple in a lake is even interesting for the direction it takes, but it does not go beyond that. The same can be said of the expected spicy scenes. Present in books, but on screen they are few and simple, missing the opportunity to create something sensual. It seems that the director was afraid of the film gaining a higher age rating, which would prevent most fans from being able to watch in theaters. It is a pity.\n\nContrary to what marketing proclaims, After is far from the sexual fantasies and fetishes of the Fifty Shades of Gray trilogy. It is clear that the film explores the latent sensuality of two young men with the hormones on the skin, increasingly in love, but also with a good dose of puritanism. Interestingly, the same puritanism that After brings about the protagonist couple is not reflected in the subplots. If the college environment is highlighted by the sinful potential, at least from the perspective of Tessa's mother, it is also in it that the film delivers its most liberal side in addressing bisexuality without judgment. It is in this respect that the screenwriter Susan McMartin tries to capture the current young audience, setting a beaten plot in an easily recognizable reality, while fighting ingrained conservatism. The love story between Tessa and Hardin, \"daring\" in itself, has its echoes also in those around them.\n\nThe proposal here is to retell the classic story of the different who fall in love, to the point of teaching each other the art of loving, facing traumas from the past and barriers of the present. This, of course, punctuating penetrating glances and the chemistry of the couple, as the subgenre booklet says. In the end, After seeks to please only fans of books. But, you run the risk of not being able to please even this audience. It is uninspired, and driven in automatic mode. A certain affection was necessary to bring the project to the cinema, but it is non-existent. Absolutely predictable, After faces the serious problem of the absence of conflict by presenting many scenes of making out between its two main actors, as if the lust portrayed compensated for the lack of history to be developed and, after all, this is exactly what After proposes: to the present day an old story about an exacerbated love, if possible making room for continuations. Demanding from him more than that is frivolous, especially for a film that, so honestly, opens up what it intends to be."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a little different than many of the other reviewers as I was lucky enough to see this film first which then lead on to me reading the books, so I didn't have any preconceptions.\n\nI actually love a teen romance and I grew up on the classics from the 80's and some of my favourites being Pretty In Pink, Sixteen Candles and Some Kind of Wonderful (and yes... I know I'm probably too old to be watching modern teen films but I'm a romantic soul and can't help myself).\n\nThere is a lot of chemistry between the two lead characters and I think they cast them well....I must say that Hero, who plays Hardin, is extremely pleasant on the eye (which enabled me to forgive some of his monotone delivery) ....but I found the rest of the cast a bit lack lustre but that said, overall I enjoyed the film and have watched it a few times since reading the books. It's definitely got the essence of the books but its almost like a tame York Notes version.....Seriously though the books are on a completely different level to this film with such a depth to the characters and detailed back stories and the inner dialogues are amazing, plus it's also very well written so you can't help but be completely drawn in to their lives ....(I literally cram read the whole series in about 5 days and it would've been less had I not had to go to work!) it's very addictive, with serious emotional highs and lows ... i loved, hated, cried and laughed along with the characters as if I was actually there.....but how do they get all that into a movie on a budget?\n\nAfter reading the books I agree with the masses that its a shame that they changed so much of the main storyline, especially the twist, but I realise this was due to the film being designed as a teen romance so it needed to appeal to a certain age group so they had to soften it up.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next film to see what they do with it, but had this film been an 18, kept more in line with the books story line and had more depth, I would have loved it so much more.\n\nIf you havent read the books I'm sure you'll enjoy it as the teen romance that it is .... if you have already read the books, then I think you'll likely be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hello dear readers of my review.\n\nAlthough the film \"After\" has already been released for a long time on the screens - I just got there yesterday and watched it. And I want to say that I liked the film \"After\": 1 hour 45 minutes flew by unnoticed watching a very light, non-meaningful picture about a huge, first youthful love that can \"change\" a person.\n\nMany scold this film for a lot of clich\u00e9s, stereotyped and predictable. Yes, it is - it is perfectly clear what the final will be, and many plot twists are predictable. But, I really liked the film - the actors were chosen nice, they look very harmoniously together, it is very pleasant to watch the development of their love. Also, beautiful views of nature, beautiful, calm musical accompaniment - add charm to this picture.\n\nThe film, of course, is more designed for young people, for an older person it will seem superficial. But I think it's a good movie to watch in the evening. There is practically no vulgarity in the film (but still they managed to insert a scene with same-sex love), but there are a lot of kisses.\n\nI will recommend viewing. Thank you all for your attention."

It's taken me a while to get around to watching these movies and I did them shamefully all in one go. Y'all can blame the the quoting of Hemingway & Bront\u00eb for that, and you could also say Hero Fiennes Tiffin played a part too *Cough* it's your typical good girl sees bad boy and then their journey begins from there. Langford and Fiennes Tiffin do a commendable job with the material they're given, They capture the feeling of being young and stepping into uncharted territory of feelings for both their characters. Considering this came from a Wattpad story I think the movie came out great, also I could have seen it been a tv show rather than movies. Looking forward to seeing Hero Fiennes in more movies in the future."

Some really good examples how not to be in a relationship. Most of the conflicts haven't got any depth. Felt like you destroyed my life, but that's okay.\n\nEven though they tried the rain, alcohol, dark atmosphere, codependant and alcoholic parent and big lie. It didn't really bring out emotitions. It wanted to make you cry so much that they didn't take the time to dwelve into these problems. Soo much.superficial out of place drama in one movie.\n\nI really not recommend this.

The entire movie I had a feeling like the producers and writers took out let's say pages number 1 15 37 99 128 and 367 of the book and said oh okay let's use these for scenes and just inserted them into the movie without connection between those scenes.

However, what made them fall in Love was their background, their story, their family, their friends... and all of this is necesary to understand why Tessa and Hardin are who they are and why they behave as they do! In the movie you do not really get to know any of this so it seems like Hardin and Tessa have a strong sexual attraction and that's it, when there's so much more between them. The lack of background is so big that you do not get to know them which is a shame... Oh and I almost forgot! Most of the scenes do not look natural I mean, they are \"POSTUREO\" in a way that dehumanizes the scene...So, for the next movie (If it ever happens ) I hope they have this into account!\n\nSaludos,"

        "review_detailed_main": "After (2.5 out of 5 stars).\n\nAfter is a romantic drama film that follows a young teenager entering college. She was raised with tight rules by her mother and has a boyfriend from high school that is caring and respects her. Tessa (Josephine Langford) is innocent. She does not party, drink, or hang out with a bunch of guys. When her roommate introduces her to a bad boy attitude kind of guy Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin). He is tattooed, does not stay in one relationship, and is rebellious against his father. She falls for him. He takes her virginity and falls for her. He does have one dark secret that she does not know about him.\n\nThe romantic drama does not offer anything new to the genre. It has its clich\u00e9s. Tessa is awkward and innocent. Hardin is the opposite. They bump heads with their views and despise each other. Until they both go out together and fall for each other. Tessa's mother cuts her off cause of her behavior. She loses her high school boyfriend cause of the new guy. There is something that Hardin has yet to share with her.\n\nThe script is cheesy with its dialogue. The direction is slow and has an uneven pace with the film. The plot is thin. The story is about an innocent girl meeting a guy that may make her different. There was barely any story. The acting was kind of stiff with Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin.\n\nBeing based on a teen novel, maybe the film will find its audience from the fans of the book. Others may just see the film has another typical clich\u00e9 romantic drama story that should have been on a lifetime channel. Overall, After is a pretty bad film with its bad acting, boring direction, stiff script, and a plot that is lacking in a story."

The story have made me felt soo much emotions. Never had a book touch me like this.\n\nSo... Dont need to tell you i was veryyyy disapointting by the movie. All the scene goes way to fast, arent well developped, some are even switch compared to the storyline, whick make no sense. You cant understand the complexity, the toxicity, the passion of their relationship in this movie. Hardin is way too soft. Tessa dont seem like the perfect little girl who control anything in her life. All the second characters seems to be there just to fill the screen, without any explanation of their role in the story. Honestly, I wonder how they could even think of making the next movies to be more representative as there is soo much important things missing in the first one.\n\nI dont expect a movie to be as great as the book (it never happened in my opinion), but they really missed the point with that one trying to make it a PG movie. Just seems like another boring teen movie.\n\nIn my point of view, if you can't explore all the complexity of a story like that in a 90min movie, make it a tv shows!"

With respect to the duration of the film I thought it would be a bit more extensive, and the actors' performance was well love molly, tessa, tristan, steph but I did not have that super connection with hardin as when I read the book I expected more toxicity part of the bad boy that Anna made us fall in love with but I did not have it, but in general I loved everything because I know that cinema is an industry that has mostly been used by men and to see that now women are daring to enter the creation of new movies that have a very positive message for youth I love\n\nwritten by: J.T RUB\u00cd FROM: NICARAGUA"

So, needless to say, the information is all very fresh in my mind. They have turned one of the best, edgy, and sexy books into a HORRIBLE, RUSHED, cliche movie that NO ONE would fully understand unless they have read the books. I'm so disappointed and wish I would have never watched this because it does not display the characters in the way it should. The acting is HORRIBLE, and this disappointed me because I am an actress in Atlanta and I know plenty of people that could have portrayed those roles 100% better. Now, the leading lead roles, like Hero and Josephine, did a great job and physically met the descriptions, but everyone else, JUST SOOOO BAD! I was laughing and covered my eyes in such disbelief on how trash this movie is.\n\nWhy rush so many pivotal moments and why try to make the movie PG-13? Anna Todd, girl, if you ever read this. DO NOT EVER LET HOLLYWOOD MANIPULATE YOU. There is a reason why you are successful, and everyone loves the traditional Hardin and Tess. I want the potty mouth bad boy that won my heart over because he had trust issues. The bad boy that was mean and showed it. I did not once see that in this movie. So disappointed. Is it because of the money? Because girl we can start a Go Fund Me. Lol. Like, I NEED to be redeemed from this low budget PG-13 nothing like the book bull crap."

A romantic story, with solid music. The problem with these films is fantasising about the \"happy end\" moments like in the ending of this movie.\n\nSuch things simply do not happen and there are no such conclusions that after the end of the relationship you will go somewhere and at that exact moment someone will come. Not in real life.\n\nAnyway, the girls (up to 24) will recognise themselves in the movie and boys will not, because all together is one \"bubble\" of foam.\n\nCheesy movie, but still leaves nice impression. There's something about these fantasies we all had and sometimes we can afford to fantasise a bit, right?\n\nTip for young people: It's nice to experience moments of \"endless love\", but know that you change the criteria later. Now you don't feel like it, but you will ... wait until 30 by the time you become Intolerant."

I still tried to think positive thinking there would be a character ark or something. But no. If you're familiar with Wattpad, the protagonist is like every teenager there is in this world of fantasy. This whole movie is marketed towards young teenagers which makes sense with the music choice and the movie's plotline. It's good that the characters are almost always consenting to their actions but they act like complete idiots and something the story doesn't even make sense. And the bad acting doesn't help. The directing was nothing special but something it was even distracting and questionable. Wish there was a 0/10 option"

It wasn't long until After became a 4 part series on Wattpad, read by millions of fans. The series then became published officially, acknowledged by more than just one direction fans.\n\nWhen I heard this was becoming a movie, I was excited. Although it felt like a guilty pleasure to be invested in some romance novel, that is not so critically acclaimed, yet I was excited to to see Anna's imagination become a reality and see this brought to life. S\n\nThere were times i'd roll my eyes at the novel, cringe at the irrationality or stupidity of the characters, but that's exactly why the books were so addictive. Each chapter would grip you in, as much as you'd tell yourself how unrealistic it would be you just kept reading. Just like you'd watch an episode of your favourite drama, - picking up from where you left off in the After series offered the same escape. You could delve into the life of Tessa and Hardin and everything that surrounded them. Their intentions are all Justified in their perspective. The P.O.V style chapters aren't exactly accepted by literary critics - a style brought over from Wattpad's best fan fiction always offered for perspective sake ... for entertainment.\n\nI always wished at times I could just watch it instead of reading, But always knew that a 1-2hr long movie would never do this intricate series justice. Sadly I wasn't proven wrong. The movie was such a let down, and waste of potential. Aside from casting and some cinematographic effort this movie was bad. What could have been a captivating and intriguing story brought to life was rendered into a horrible rendition of the books. Failure to to detail the majority of the plot line and characterisation accurately made this film so poor. It is such a shame to see such a disappointing film for such a well received (for the most part) series. The cast was wasted potential. Some hit and miss. I feel the leads were cast almost perfectly, Ken Scott however is American in the film, when he is supposed to be British? Yet I believe Hero and Josephine had good chemistry but the lines they were given were bland and cringe worthy.\n\nThis entire series would have worked so much better as a series. Chapters could be 1-2 episodes, that's how much happens within them. If I had never read the books I would not have cared for this film in the slightest.\n\nI hope someone can turn this into the TV series it deserves. I can see it being as big as,the Vampire Diaries, True Blood, Gossip Girl or Skins, the raunchy parts can't be skimmed over either, another PG13 remake won't cut it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This isn't one of the best teen romances out there. Better than some, but I think you have to be under the age of 18 to really like this. It has a bad boy \"hero\" who goes from being a rude, dull dud to suddenly seducing the sweet, innocent heroine. The actress who plays the lead is likeable in her wide-eyed naivety, but I kept cringing at so many clich\u00e9 moments. I do think that some younger girls may enjoy this movie, especially ones that still buy into the idea that you can be the one special girl that changes a jerk into something special. The problem is that once you're out of your teens, you realize that that scenario isn't actually a romantic ideal, and thus the male \"hero\" of this story will just generate a lot of eye rolls. Overall it's trying to be an intense romantic drama but it's a bit cheesy... though admittedly still kind of cute."

You will waste your time and break the mood of authentic romantics.\n\nWatch and dream!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, I would say that this is even worse than Twilight or 50 shades. I started reading the book, but I didn't finish it, because it got a little repetitive. After the movie I found out what the book was about and how they changed the original \"shocking\" ending to this watered down soft 9- year old version. I mean, the original story ending isn't that original either. It has been done by so many romantic movies (How to lose a guy in 10 days for example), but at least we would have a shock moment and it could have saved this garbage from being such garbage. How did the main characters fall in love in the book? That was actually quite hot and not so badly written. What do we see here? No dialogue, they look each other in the eyes and a loud song plays in the background. Then they go for a walk or lie in the bed together and a loud song plays in the background again. Then they eat something and a loud song... and so on. That is the laziest writing I've ever seen. You can maybe make 1 or 2 such scenes in the movie, but you can't swap real dialogue and a story line for some music video montages and call it a movie! So we got an introduction, something happening, soundtrack, soundtrack, something happening, soundtrack, the end. And it's like an open ending so we will want more? No, thanks."
