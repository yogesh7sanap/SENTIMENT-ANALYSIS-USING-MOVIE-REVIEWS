        "review_detailed_main": "It has been nearly 5 years since I went and saw a movie first day first show in the theatres. But such was the level of anticipation with \"gangs of wasseypur\" that I found myself standing in front of the ticket counter at quarter to nine. The movie, which is 160 minutes long, starts with a shoot-them-up which may be the most authentic shoot-to-kill scene in Hindi cinema. The movie tells the story of rivalries between different sects of Muslims: the butchers, Qureshis, and the Pathans, Khans and extend over a period of three generations. The story starts from the pre- independence era when the British owned the mines in Dhanbad. After independence, these mines pass on to the wealthy landlord who hires an exiled Pathan to act as his strongman. The pathan, the father of Sardar Khan (Manoj Vajpayee) has been kicked out of his village, Wasseypur, after a confrontation with the local musclemen, the Qureshis, and is now forced to work in the mines of Dhanbad. He starts becoming too big for his shoes and is bumped off by the landlord thus beginning a series of killings and counter-killings. The acting by the \"star\" cast is stunning with Manoj Vajpayee leading the pack in as good as a performance as \"Bheeku Mahatre\" in Satya. When he stares lustfully at the back side of Reema Sen (here resurrected after being in the wilderness for nearly half a dozen years), you can feel the lust as a physical thing. He is backed by a very strong ensemble cast. The real strength of the movie is its dialogues. The words, replete with the choicest of abuses, feel as if they were wiretapped. The conversation rings true to life and had me laughing at the sheer vulgarity of it. The patois is captured very faithfully. The only negative point about the movie is its length which could have been edited somewhat in the second half when the third generation takes up (like the long Godfather III, if you may). Anurag Kashyap has put his soul into the movie and that is visible from every frame of the movie. The direction is the best I have seen this year in Hindi cinema and will only increase the expectations from the second part of this opus. And that is why I am jealous of the lucky bastards at the Cannes film festival who got to see both the parts back to back. The movie ends at a tantalizing junction and the prospect of meeting with these barely lovable characters for a second outing left me salivating."

The story spans last seven decades of Indian history with events taking place in mining towns of Wasseypur and Dhanbad. The tale of the cities is portrayed in the rivalry between the family of Shahid Khan,an ambitious man who loots trains in British Era by the name of Sultana Daku and Ramdahri Singh and Local Contractor turned Politician. The animosity is passed to the next generation where Sardar Khan portrayed by Manoj Bajpai,who wants to avenge his fathers death by destroying Ramdhari Singh and his family and the Qureshi's who outcast his father.\n\nManoj Bajpai has outclassed himself. Every single actor has done his part perfectly. You will feel like you are actually living in that part of the world. Hats off to the team, they have thoroughly researched every detail and make the whole scenario looked like real. A Must Must watch for if you love quality."

The level of scope and detail are unparalleled and makes the audience feel like they are really living in these time periods. The balancing act of so many characters is achieved deftly and with great actors who bring a strong sense of brutal ambition. This is an epic in the true sense of the term with technical perfection and an incredible story."

Direction, screenplay, narration, acting, music, cinematography, everything about this movie is top notch. Anurag Kashyap is truly the best at whatever he does. You wont even feel the length of 5 hours and 20 minutes. Manoj Bajpai's has proved once again that he is the powerhouse of acting. Not one scene is out of order and everything is properly explained with no questions unanswered. Dialogues are very sharp and as close to reality as it can get.\n\nThe opening sequence in itself is a masterpiece. The way its scripted and executed is just mind blowing. All the bloodshed keeps getting more and more innovative. Its one of those movies that will always be mentioned everywhere whenever someone talks about the Indian cinema."

The way each character is introduced is terrific. It is story telling at its best. From Shahid Khan to Sardar Khan to Sultan, you actually end up fearing them all - the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Manoj Bajpai is amazing as Sardar (he really got into the character) and the narration (by one of the gang members) adds a lot of flavor to the entire flow of the movie.\n\nSiddiqui's role is brief in the first part and I have a feeling he will play a major role in the remaining part of this epic. He is already looking good. Tigmanshu as Ramadheer Singh is terrific, his expressions too good.\n\nApart from this, the movie is informative - it very subtly tells the audience all about the way Indian coal mafia has progressed over the years, the gang wars, the politics. Obviously there is a lot of slang. I have not seen a Hindi movie with so crude a language ever, absolutely not recommended for family viewing and children/teenagers.\n\nThe camera angles, especially the final sequence is superb.\n\nAnurag Kashyap is India's answer to Quentin Terentino. Gangs of Waseypur is already a Cult."

But the essence of it is demanding and commendable. Everyone has done a splendid job. This one is not loose even for a minute. The most important aspect of its appreciation is its star-cast. A lot of new faces and still it doesn't disappoint. You can just imagine the crew on board when actors like Piyush Mishra & Yashpal Sharma are totally wasted. An entertaining cinema worth watching. There is no doubt that Anurag Kashyap is Bollywood's Quentin Tarantino. A must watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "An epic tale about loyalty, crime, lust, treachery and vendetta. A cinematic magnum opus.\n\nSet in Dhanbaad's(Jharkhand)Village, called Wasseypur, \"Gangs of Wasseypur\" starts with our very own \"Kyunki Saas bhi bahu thi\" and goes beyond the cinematic ethics. A saga which has all the ingredients of a cult cinema like black humor, full mouthed characters, adultery, bullets,vengeance and everything you expect in a film by Anurag Kashyap.\n\nEn route to end of British Raj in India, Shahid Khan, a dacoit, loots the British trains, masquerading as Sultana Daku, is shot dead by Ramadhir Singh's goon. Shahid's son, Sardar Khan, pledges to avenge his father's death and shaves his head. He becomes one of the most notorious gangsters of Wasseypur. The film reconnoiters his connections with power, politics and fraternity of crime. There is a clash between two Muslim groups Pathans and Qureshis, about their covetousness for glory and money.\n\nManoj Bajpai gives an impeccable performance as a violent and lecherous man. It is one of the powerhouse acts, we will ever encounter. The real find of the decade is Tigmanshu Dhuila a well-known cult director (Hassil, Paan Singh Tomar, Saheb Biwi aur Gangster etc), who embodied the character as if he himself is Ramdhir Singh.\n\nRicha Chadda is believable as Sardar Khan's anxious and bold wife. Reema Sen is good as a silent and steamy concubine of Sardar Khan.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui is a born thespian; he is believable as weed smoking, Amitabh's die-hard fan and black sheep of the family. We have already witnessed him in \"Kahaani\" and \"Peepli live\". I think he is one of the most underrated actors, has now got an opportunity to flaunt himself in GOW II(I saw the trailer of Part II after the credit rolled).\n\nRest of the cast Piyush Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Huma Quershi(debut-She looks ravishing while persuading the theater's security guard for the second show of the movie \"Trishul\") and others are so authentic that you will easily relate the characters with North India (Bihar), the dialects, the dialogue delivery, the expressions are genuine.\n\nThe music by Sneha Khanwalkar is down to earth, a triumph, it has the rustic soul and is very unique. One can understand the geniuses by listening the beats and lyrics. Some of them are folks sung by the locals.\n\nAnd after all it's Anurag Kashyap ,who can go to any length to enhance the quality of Indian Cinema. Undoubtedly it has been screened in Cannes,and people watched the entire saga (a delirious 5 Hours 20 Minutes run time) and lauded with the accolades. However, it should have been edited 20 minutes.\n\nImpatiently waiting for Part II.\n\n8.2/10"

However, the only disappointing aspect of the movie is that one has to wait for the part two of the movie to see how the story unfolds. The movie is based at Wasseypur and other surrounding areas of Dhanbad. The time-line of the movie spans from early 1940s to early 1990s. The second part of the movie is expected to span from early 1990s to mid 2000s. It's a story of Pathans Shahid Khan (played by Jaideep Ahlawat)and his son Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpayee, Qureshis, and politician-cum-coal mine owner-cum- local don Ramadheer Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia)and his son. The tussle between Pathans and Qureshis, and that between Shahid Khan and Sardar Khan on one side and Ramadheer Singh and his son on the other side are the highlights of the movie. In between, one also sees different facets of coal mafia, revenge, rivalries among Muslims, and even love stories too. The movie is intense, gripping, and has a fair sprinkling of cuss words one finds in Bihar and Jharkhand, where the film is based. The music of the film is another highlight, and one needs to watch the film to fully realize the relevance of songs in the film. In short: a must- watch movie for those who love hard hitting movies with great acting from all the actors."

Smith\n\nManoj Bajpai wants revenge on Tigmanshu Dhulia who had treacherously killed his father.\n\nSometimes there comes a story which has an epic kind of sweep. Spanning generations, introducing several characters, all caught up in empire building, love, lust and enimity. There isn't much point to them, the protagonists aren't clearly defined, the storyline meandering, their lives entwined in the events that befell the nation and the small town that the story inhabits.\n\nSet in the backdrop of Wasseypur, a small part of Dhanbad, capital of India's coal belt, numerous characters come and go. India gains independence, Emergency is imposed, coal mining is first unionized and later nationalized. However, the story, at its core remains about Tigmanshu's star rising ever higher and Manoj building his own empire from humble origins, while seeking revenge.\n\nThere are times when you wish things would happen quicker. That there were less characters. Or that there was a point to some of them, who are introduced to either only die or shine bright for a few frames before being forgotten.\n\nThe environment is beautifully captured, including the lingo, the mannerisms whether it's the abject despair of the poor mine worker, condemned to live his life in the black shafts. The bestiality of the butcher, as he hacks away at his meat. The cowardice of the cops. The empty bravado of the minister's goons. Or the naked lust as hungry men eye their next catch, the woman to slake their base desires, even as the wife lies at home, pregnant.\n\nHowever, there are several things which let the film down. For a film set in the coal belt, we see very little of it. Apart from one memorable scene where, caked in the black coaldust, a few men fight for their lives and another where coals water absorption properties are highlighted, there is too little was about the black mineral and much more made of ancillary businesses. National events of importance are also given short shrift or brushed over, their impact shown quickly, transitions happening smoothly rather than in real life where each change creates havoc in such a tiny eco-system.\n\nGreat camera work, flawless performances, several one-liners and very catchy music keep you engaged, though, as our two key protagonists slug it out and religion comes in, with different sects of Muslims engaging in war amongst each other. The story moves forward with a Godfather-esque gait, a kind of glacial majesty, in stops and starts, not always making sense. But then, isn't that how real life is ?"

GOW is a superb film which needs to be watched by anyone and everyone who has the slightest of respect and love for films and filmmaking.\n\nSneha Khawalker's rockingtingly superb music brings a whole new level of excitement in the film and Rajeev Ravi's cinematography is very very efficient, sprinkled with quite a few shots of sheer brilliance.\n\nAll this make a nice, superbly tasty biryani and the credit can only go the masterchef Mr.Anurag Kashyap.\n\n8/10, and I'd defo recommend all my friends to go and watch this film in CINEMAS!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Co-written and directed by Anurag Kashyap, this film will probably propel the filmmaker into the ranks occupied by the likes of Coppola and Scorsese in crafting Mafia styled epics, filled with the themes of brotherhood, revenge, betrayal, sex and violence. Showcased at this year's Cannes Directors' Fortnight with its sequel screened back to back, Kashyap has brought forth a sprawling, three generation span long tale of the titular Gangs of the coal mining town, where three crime families engage one another for infamy, riches and power supremacy.\n\nAnd what he had done to provide some gravitas to this tale, was a semi-documentary look at its background against the town of Wasseypur, where we witness how the wheelings and dealings between shady businessmen and their workers, and how some become politicians through bullying, gangster tactics, the laundering of money, and eventually buying support to ascend the political ladder. It's an intriguing commentary about, by extension, the country's state of affairs, and how some can grow influence through the use of hired muscles out to do their dirty work, for the duration of their useful lifespan, before being discarded.\n\nBeginning in explosive fashion with a full assault on a property, key figures get introduced, but only to keep things under wraps until the companion film in Part 2. We then get brought back to the 40s Wasseypur and Dhanbad land, where the British found themselves up against the formidable forces of the Qureshis , only for Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat) to impersonate their mysterious leader, pre-empt their attacks and undercut the Qureshis in their own game. Soon the Khans got exiled, only for Shahid to be brought back to Wasseypur when Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia), a rich, corrupt industrialist, needed a muscle man to help in his exploitation of workers. But jealously meant Ramandhir's orders to get rid of Shahid, and thus opening up the feud to the second generation, led by Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai) who is hell bent on revenge.\n\nBut in a tragi-comedy sort of way, the character of Sardar is somewhat tough on the outside with his ruthlessness, but all soft and fuzzy inside with his libido being lacking in control, with first wife Nagma (Richa Chadda) being relatively tolerant of his gallivanting ways only because she gets pregnant too easily, and the introduction of a Bengali girl Durga (Reema Sen) whom he met while on the run. This sets up the third generation of cast with Sardar's sons Danish (Vineet Singh) and Faizal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), with a hint on what's to come disrupt his family dynamics with illegitimate son Definite, entering the picture, whom we'll see more of in the next film whose trailer gets airtime right after the end credits.\n\nOn the other corner are the heir of the Qureshis in Ehsaan (Vipin Sharma) and Sultan (Pankaj Tripathy), who are caught in the middle with their alliance with Ramandhir, and the marriage of Sultan's sister Sharma (Amirota Jha). And what makes it interesting in the entire male dominated world, is the story of the women behind the men, as seen from the major character arcs on Sardar's family involved in romance of some sort, playing critical roles in defining the male characters and contrasting them in both their private and public lives, and instrumental especially in the final scene, and going into the next film.\n\nIt might be overwhelming at first with a myriad of characters being introduced, but Kashyap got his presentation all under control like an old hand, bringing on new characters with proper title flashes, and providing adequate screen time for each to establish his or her backstory. This wonderfully crafts out motivations and characteristics of each family member, especially between the sons of Sardar, who will all play pivotal roles in the sequel, since the very first scene here would have shown each of them under different camps, and teasing us with just how allegiances would play out with family members now standing under different banners. Part of the engagement now would be to develop the narrative to reach the inevitable, and with the ensemble set up, the possibilities are endless.\n\nAnd as such, Gangs of Wasseypur has its fair share of surprises thrown about, where those slighted will almost always come back with a vengeance. Revenge may be high on Sardar's agenda, but there's a permeating poetic justice that provides a cruel twist of irony, with the narrative rich enough to allow various subplots to populate the story and to add a vivid texture to the characters instead of letting them become one dimensional characters. It's a sprawling epic that called upon the best of Bollywood sans the usual Masala formula, to showcase the skills, craftsmanship and talent in the industry that are capable of making a serious, critically acclaimed film with commercial appeal. Definitely highly recommended, although I'm reserving judgement until Part 2 when the film is complete. If you haven't watched an Indian film for some time already, if at all, then make Gangs of Wasseypur your launch point now."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gangs of Wasseypur is undoubtably & unarguably one of the best gangster films to roll out from India. This 2 part feature with a total runtime of a whopping 321 minutes is an absolute flawless masterpiece directed by Anurag Kashyap. Gangs of Wasseypur presents almost everything happening in the badlands of Bihar, starting from the crudest forms of social evils, conflicts, vengeance ridden acts, gang wars, class differences, illegal arms, drug dealing, craze for Bollywood, sexual drives, betrayal, love, lust, hatred, friendship, hierarchy, camaraderie, competitiveness, corruption, adulteration, dacoity, savagery and rampant hooliganism blended together with utmost grace.\n\nAnurag Kashyap's attempt to bring it all in front of the audience is really a nothing less than great attempt, especially for the city folks. The ensemble cast of Bajpayee, Siddiqui, Chadha, Dhulia, Khan, Mishra, Ahlawat, Rao, Tripathi, Singh and (perhaps the youngest of them...)Kumar acted out their roles with utter realism and conviction by engulfing themselves in hardcore method acting. Manoj Bajpayee has indeed delivered an absolutely outstanding performance and is easily the heart beat of the entire movie. All the supporting actors' performances were enthralling, eccentric, explosive and yet loveable and funny.\n\nA well crafted screenplay and Rajeev Ravi's cinematography was just outstanding in matching to the various moods & tones set by Anurag Kashyap. Ably supported by the authentic songs composed by Sneha Kanwalkar and GV Prakash Kumar's Background score which gives a certain eeriness to the movie throughout. Shrikant Desai-Zubi Johal-Rajiv Sunna trio's makeup & Subodh Srivastava's costume design adds to the awe factor to Gangs of Wasseypur, depicting the usual tendencies of villagers to dress up and maintain their hair styles imitating celebrities is highly accurate, as was the portrayal of hostile, vengeance ridden hate of each and every character, Where all the dirt and mug of the society seems to ensemble in the form of abstract commodities. The film feeds even the most minute of details....\n\nOverall, No words can describe what a gem of a movie this is. You can feel that each and every scene actually happens in front of your eyes. You live through the scenes. You will live and die with the characters. Even Anurag Kashyap himself will not be able to make another film as good as this one. In fact he acknowledges the fact. A must watch for everyone."

        "review_title": "Watch it for its execution, performances, music and dialogues BUT don't expect something fresh in its story content.",
        "review_detailed_main": "GANGS OF WASSEYPUR also tries to walk on that thin line between the meaningful and entertaining cinema which in fact turns out to be a worth watching project due to its execution, performances, music and dialogues, but at the same time doesn't has anything fresh to offer in terms of concept, storyline or script.\n\nFollowing the path already discovered in Hindi Cinema by Ram Gopal Varma in his Rakt Charitra Part 1 & Part 2 releasing in the gap of two months, Anurag decides to go the same way with his GOW Part 1 & 2. But for some undisclosed reasons he doesn't mention this two part film in GOW's posters or promotion as was boldly done by RGV.\n\nAnurag's films have always been region based projects featuring subjects revolving around cities like Mumbai, Rajasthan, Punjab and more. So following the same trend, this time he takes us to a rather lesser known region of Wasseypur (Dhanbad) and its coal mine industry dealing in gang wars. The film gives you no time to settle down and simply starts off with a long bloody sequence of guns, murders and bloodshed. But then it takes too much time of almost 40 minutes to tell you the background of the story and the lead actors enter the screen only after this initial hiccup.\n\nThe first half mainly deals with defining the basis of all the rivalry going on with small references of the Coal-mining history starting from the British era. Thankfully, the director comes into his form post intermission and gives you many more striking sequences which are surely not for the faint hearted. There are more brutal murders and the deadly gang wars continue till the next generation which somehow also gives you a feeling of being repetitive. Further, the length of close to 3 hours leads to a little restlessness as it moves towards the climax. But 3 things truly save the film despite of having all the routine content as far as the storyline is concerned.\n\nFirst being the execution/direction, including the way it has been brilliantly shot making you feel the rustic ambiance of the locations. Particularly the second half which has more happening on the screen as compared to the first. The writing is noteworthy with dialogues written exactly in the way they are spoken in such remote areas with all those cuss words.\n\nSecond are the performances by the entire cast excelling their own previous acts undoubtedly. Lead from the front by Manoj Bajpayee, GOW would not have been possible without him for sure. The actor plays his role with such ease and conviction that you are bound to ask that from where he actually belongs from. Along with Manoj stands tall, a surprisingly competent performance from the director of PAAN SINGH TOMAR, Tigmanshu Dhulia, who is truly mesmerizing. With his superb act he clearly reveals the secret that why all the actors always come out with such great award winning performances in his directed movies. That's because he himself knows the art so well. Completing the trio is Piyush Mishra, who once again reminds the industry the power house of talent within himself of being an actor, writer, lyricist, singer and composer.\n\nIn the supporting cast, Jaideep Ahlawat, Jameel Khan, Pankaj Tripathi, Vipin Sharma & Yashpal Sharma (in a cameo) are really great sinking deep into their respective characters. Nawazuddin Siddiqui gets into the limelight towards the climax and looks like he is going to be the surprise package of GOW-II (as shown in the trailer). In the female lead, there is another power packed performance from Richa Chadda, who is still remembered as the OYE LUCKY LUCKY OYE girl. But after this movie, she is sure going to be called as GANGS OF WASSEYPUR girl. Reema Sen superbly provides the much needed subtle, sensuality to the project and so does Huma Qureshi who has a much meatier role in Part II. Last but not the least comes the Soundtrack of the film by the extremely talented Sneha Khanwalkar which exactly provides the director what he needed to enhance the overall impact of the film on the viewers. The songs are earthy & folk mixed with the modern arrangement and even sung by the local singers which perfectly suit the mood of the film. Anurag intelligently uses the tracks merged in the background score which neither hinders the pace nor work as an obstacle to his narration.\n\nSo, GANGS OF WASSEYPUR is sure going to get rave reviews from all corners. But whether the same would be the result on the Box Office or not remains dicey. The film is no doubt exceptional in the way it is presented, enacted and executed. Still its overall theme remains the routine with nothing new to offer to the common viewer and there are too many characters thrown in by the director in his narrative. Hence, it is immensely watchable for everyone interested in something exceptional tried on the screen but at the same time, it also doesn't have any surprises or twists and turns in its clich\u00e9 story content.\n\nSo, once again the choice is all yours after reading all the energetic write-ups on the film written all over the media."

The story Gangs of Wasseypur has been inspired from reality scripted and told in such a way that it even comes out as an entertainer. All credit goes to the director. Anurag Kashyap is the best at least in Bollywood when it comes out to portray reality. The movie is divided in two parts but on IMDb it's merged into a single profile. It doesn't matter much; one can show his respect at same place.\n\nTone, Script & Story: The movie portrays growth and demise of criminal groups that existed in place called Wasseypur. The movie is very nicely scripted.\n\nDirection, Screenplay, Cinematography: As discussed all the praise goes to Anurag Kashyap. The filming locations bring the story to its life.\n\nMusic: A lot of local taste is added. I would term music to be 'very good'. Acting: All the actors associated do justice their roles. It's a delight to watch them.\n\nFinal Verdict: You can relate, only if you belong one of such neighborhood. You can add it to your collections to have something of such places to be in your knowledge."

So there is little bit history lesson of India there, which is cool.\n\nThe character is very different with the Godfather counterpart, Sardar Khan is not like Vito Corleone, he is more violence and kinda selfish, although their core story almost similar. But they are totally different character. The other filler characters is totally different.\n\nGood news , there is no dancing in this movie, but surprisingly, there is many good soundtracks in this film. They put great traditional Indian music instead the typical music in Indian movies.\n\nIf you like The Godfather I think you can appreciate this Gang of Wasseypur, even if you hate Indian movies like me. This is not typical Indian movies, totally worth checking."

This is the best gangster movie Bollywood has ever made, and that's saying something since Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai also exists.\n\nWhen the film begins, it seems like it will be the same old, generic good guy vs bad guy movie. But as the story progresses, the line between the good and bad people blurs to the point where it doesn't exist anymore. In the beginning it feels like Sardar Khan is supposed to be the hero, but slowly he's shown to be a terrible person who gets in fights with everyone and marries a second time just because he's getting horny.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui's Faisal is introduced in the second part after the demise of Sardar Khan. The bad guys really make you feel like killing them, and the way they speak is very reminiscent of the villages from Bihar and east UP. The acting by literally everyone is phenomenal, such that it inspired memes for years to come, and that's being in a good way. Every scene has been choreographed so well it actually gives you the feeling of those poor, low class families from suburban areas.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many web series come up - Mirzapur, Paatal Lok, Sacred Games. The fact remains that Gangs of Wasseypur is the OG that started it all, and no one can ever replace its legacy."

This is a story of two Muslim communities i.e. Qureshi and Khan. After partition (separation of Pakistan and India), a coal mine was purchased by a Indian businessman named Tigmanshu Dhulia(Ramadhir Singh) from British Government. Ramadhir Singh hired a hit man to take care of his coal mine workers. Ramadhir Singh is a political person, he used different people to keep his influence in the Wasseypur village and he didn't mind to take someone's life, if he goes against him.\n\nI read somewhere in the previous review that the director Anurag Kashyap is the answer of Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino. I agreed with the person. Some scenes in this movie remembered me Quentin Tarantino's action flick Kill Bill.\n\nThe Muslim events and festivals i.e. Eid, Marriages etc. are very well shown on the big screen.\n\nI rate this movie 8 out of 10."

They are crazy, eccentric, quirky and extremely violent without any remorse.\n\nThe voice-over and the political information overwhelm you so much that it feels like you are sitting for an exam. You have to be so attentive especially in the first hour.\n\nJaideep Ahalawat as Shahid Khan is the emotional anchor of the film. His track is the only time the revenge drama works which later fades away and I was watching it more as a madcap entertainer. Jaideeps fight sequence in the coal mines reminded me of Kaala Pathar. His intensity as an actor is terrific in whatever little he got to do. For me he is the find of the film.\n\nThe world of Wasseypur is filled with strong women who speak their mind and don't take things lying down. Richa Chaddha, Reema Sen and Huma Qureshi deliver terrific performances. Every scene that had Richa Chaddha in it was my favorite. The last time I enjoyed Manoj Bajpayees performance was in Aks. This one beats it and is his 2nd best after Satya.\n\nEven though Tigmanshu Dhulia plays his part with silent menace his character comes across too weak to oppose the overpowering character of Shahid Khan which takes away some spice from the film. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the lanky Faisal Khan is the Amitabh Bachchan of the 70s. In his eyes there are multitudes of emotions.\n\nIf I sit down to write down moments that I enjoyed in the film I can fill pages mentioning it. If Anurag Kashyap has intended to make it as a masala entertainer against the backdrop of revenge he has definitely succeeded in making one but if his vision was to tell a revenge drama he falls flat on the face. I just didn't care for the revenge angle. Supporting his vision is the mind blowing music by Sneha Khanwilkar and the background music of G.V.Prakash. Both of them add funk to the violent and dark tone of the film. And to all those who worry about the duration of a film and say it is slow paced I would say that the duration of a film appears long only if it fails to engage you. An engaging film can never be too long. Gangs of Wassyepur didn't bore me for a second.\n\nWord of mouth Gangs of Wasseypur is Anurags tribute to the American gangster movies and Godfather and also his answer to the masala films of our times.Its an item film.\n\nRating 3.5 (Good)\n\nTicket Meter Worth 250 bucks\n\nP.S. pls stay right till the end to watch the trailer of GOW2."

        "review_detailed_main": "The good thing for the film was its screening in two parts. It's not that you will not like the film for 5 hours but there are a few moments when you might feel bored. Now about the film I would say that this is the only film that I can remember now, the characters of which you would bond so much. Making such a long film is a great risk and that was worth it. The story is purely based on revenge. What these 5 hours has made us feel in the end was that the revenge was truly authentic. You will bond entirely with all that hatred. Of Course we have to pick up a side with whom we sympathize. The shaking feeling was when Ramadheer singh told Faisal that the whole fighting had started due to his grandfather and he wanted to live, otherwise his grandfather might have killed him. This was the moment when I realized that he was not at all wrong in his place of thinking. But then I also realized the power of films. The director wanted us to have sympathy with the family of Manoj Vajpayee. That is one angle of showing the film. There can be a story made from the point of Ramadheer where we will sympathize with him.\n\nWhile watching the film I felt like I am revisiting a lot of films. There were a lot of instances when one can feel that he is watching the Indian version of godfather. Now the way this film is made defines what inspiration is. I also felt in the last 30 minutes like I was watching instances of City of God. Anurag Kashyap has properly set a standard for the Indian Directors about how to take inspiration from foreign films. When the audience sees that the starting scenes and the characters which were shown so early are linked in the end, they are hooked to the seats. They might feel amazed at that instant (also considering the fact that all these important twists and links are shown in the last 20 minutes of the film) and say that the film is amazing after leaving theater. While this is obvious for the Indian Audience who is deprived of such stories since they are used to watch senseless themes of Cocktail and many others. So, I would not say that the story or anything is so amazing, but this is what the audience of India need to start with. There is a lot more potential in filmmaking and I have no doubt that Anurag Kashyap too has that power to make films like the seventh seal. But he is bound by the mindset of our audience. I believe that he is taking his viewer's through a carefully chosen path to make them mature enough to understand films of Ingmar Bergman or Stanley Kubrick.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe film has a good story along with good performances which is the first reason to watch the film. To keep the viewer engaged, the film has a lot of twists till the end. I would not consider this film in the black comedy genre but it definitely has so many instances when you will praise the director for his witticism. Coming over to the songs, I felt that the soundtrack was better in the second part. The best humoristic moment in the film was when the two goons were catching each other and their bikes went out of petrol. That moment was too hilarious. Both are standing in the queue to fill the tank. There are many instances like this which gives you authentic feel of India. The second part bagged good songs as well. The portrayal of the ladies in the family was awesome. The way that the film involved us in their daily household activities was something not usual in Indian Films. Coming to the characters, I got attached with Nawajuddin Shiddiki much more than Manoj Vajpayee. His portrayal was very close to that of Al Pacino in Godfather. All the supporting cast performed extremely well.\n\nIn all, rarely in Indian cinema has this type of film been made especially with so much characters and their development.\n\nMESSAGE: \"!!Revenge!!\"\n\nVERDICT: \"A must watch\""

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Gangs of Wasseypur\" has been a forerunner in Crime Thrillers since early 2010s. It flaunts enough intrepidity with violent stuffs. Nevertheless it totters due to a sparse narration, therefore a prolonged screenplay adds up to its ambiguity!\n\n\n\nAmidst a profusion of talents on board; the narrative style eradicates its adeptness. Therefore failing to compliment an authentic art direction. Cinematography & the Ambience being set in correlation with realism bearing fruitful results In storytelling. Presentation is ethereal with memorable dialogues glazed by witty humour. Soundtrack takes an unconventional yet interesting route which may have polarizing point of views.\n\nPerformances are extraordinaire. And why it wouldn't be? Just take a peek at the ensembled cast, carefully assembled by Mr. Kashyap. Jaydeep Ahlawat, Pankaj Tripathi, Manoj Bajpayee, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Richa Chadda, Vineet Kumar, Huma Qureshi. Today, each one of them having their own shows; enduringly proves Anurag's prowess as a talent spotter.\n\nDespite with a plethora of positives, Some facets of the execution are off putting. A tedious runtime with disheveled narration confusing me several times. The timelines being mentioned in here aren't properly coordinated. Handling all the different characters with same importance & value isn't an easy task. The writing here definitely lacks in that aspect as well. The story shines the brightest in high octane moments. Likewise delivering a relatively pallid outcome regarding romantic Interests and dramatic portions.\n\nIn conclusion, I had too much expectations going in. It doesn't absolutely disappoint but I had definitely hoped for more. Perhaps the higher standards constantly given by OTT platforms in similar contents have spoiled me big time!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a gangster film, in a time when gangster films have been done to death. In order to create one that is truly good and stands out from the rest, you must start off with a good initial idea. This film lacks that idea, and creates an extremely generic, clich\u00e9d crime film that more than certainly over stays it's welcome. This movie took me two days to watch, and throughout I was wondering if it was possible to get any more boring. 320 minutes of hacking off limbs, weird music scores in the middle of a scene and nonintellectual dialogue just ruin what could have been an epic if they could have pulled off such a runtime.\n\nUltimately Gangs Of Wasseypur fails on a grand scale. Nothing in this film is remotely interesting, the film takes too long to end (hence it takes too long for anything meaningful to happen) and the direction, acting and script almost make it the worst I've seen. I would give it an 'F', but I don't think it is deserving of that."

        "review_title": "Gangs of Wasseypur: Crude, Violent and Enjoyable",
        "review_detailed_main": "Anurag Kashyap's ambitious Epic Gangs of Wasseypur is a lethally long and detailed view of the life of a single gangster family and not gangs exactly.\n\nSpread across 7 decades and over three generations it tells an authentically made and wickedly enjoyable romp of violence, politics, power and sex.\n\nThe film begins in the early 40s with the genesis of the gangs getting formed between the Muslim communities of the Qureshis (Butcher clan) and the Pathans. Trying to take advantage of this divide is the local contractor of coal mines Ramadheer Singh (director Tingmanshu Dhulia).\n\nAs the film progresses, the three groups transition from one criminal activity to another and keep slowly increasing their enmity siding with one another. The Coal mafia point is lost midway and the criminal activities start ranging from human trafficking to even fisheries extortion.\n\nWhat strikes from the word go is the sheer realism of the ganglands of Bihar from nearly perfect performances of the very believable Bihar characters, to the dress sense punctuated by what is an almost unheard of in your face soundtrack made up of local Bihari hits mixed in modern sounds, this is Anurag's best in terms of art direction (maybe only bettered by his far superior Black Friday)\n\nThere is so much going on in the movie that at times it's hard to enjoy all of it. The sexually crude songs playing constantly in the back ground, the numerous acts of violence (at times hard to connect) or for that matter the out and out vulgar dialogues spouted by pretty much all the characters of the film.\n\nHowever there is one major drawback which makes the film's narration slightly uneven and over dependent on a poorly placed cricket-like commentary to bridge the gaps. For example not much is shown or discussed of how the coal mafia operated other than the commentary and thus we get only glimpses of how the other two gangs, The Qureshi's Butcher Gang (led by Sultan) and Ramadheer Singh's sophisticated political gang, are evolving.\n\nInstead, the script chooses to spend almost incessant time on the family and life of the alpha male Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai) including his long drawn out romance with the Bengali immigrant Durga (a very hot Reema Sen)\n\nSardar Khan's Feisty wife Nagma (played perfectly by Richa Chaddha) ends up having more screen space than the main antagonist Ramadheer Singh (who could have been a tour de force). In the end Ramadheer Singh comes across more as a weakling against a thug like Sardar Khan. A little hard to believe considering he's been a landlord for a long time and is a politician to boot.\n\nI guess with the film being made by Anurag Kashyap, a lot of folks will tell you that this is an awesome film which could hype-kill the movie.\n\nIt is undoubtedly a masterstroke in terms of gritty depiction of the ganglands but it could easily have been a lot crisper and stayed a little true to its title.\n\nYou could also give a benefit of a doubt to the script considering there is the still to be released second part which requires the side characters to take centre stage and hence so much time spent on their development.\n\nOf course, the 3 hour long film picks up in the last thirty minutes when the third generation begins to come into the fore in a godfatheresque fashion and the film ends with a perfect act of violence you would have expected a long time back.\n\nThe second part of the film will be released in a couple of weeks and rest assured that those who have seen the first part will flock to see how this saga ends in what should be a definite cracker.\n\nTo sum it up, don't go in expecting a master piece and you will thoroughly enjoy and even love the film.\n\nSpecial Mention: Try listening carefully to the songs playing in the background esp. Womaniya and Hunter \u2013 tunes which refuse to leave your head."

        "review_title": "160-odd minutes of sheer cinematic brilliance",
        "review_detailed_main": "I was first alerted of this movie by the sheer waves it was making in the Cannes Film Festival, and for the very obvious reason that it featured the hugely talented maverick director, Anurag Kashyap who had already carved a niche for himself by virtue of his brilliant direction in many unconventional, \"art\" films. The other reason was that one of my favourite actors, Manoj Bajpayee(one of those rare Indian actors who actually understand the meaning of acting), the genius who lived through his characters in films like Satya, Raajneeti, and 1971. Apart from these factors, what attracted me to the film was its gigantic ensemble cast(Piyush Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Tigmanshu Dhulia).\n\nI went to the theatre to catch part 1 without knowing what to expect, given Kashyap's penchant to making excellent films whose heady content are marked by ambiguous overtones; you never can really interpret any of Kashyap's films in one way!\n\nDitto for Gangs of Wasseypur as well. I will not dwell on the plot, you will have to see the movie yourselves. What I will dwell on is the cinema itself. Firstly, to say that it is a violent movie is an understatement: there isn't just violence, you have men being butchered, gore splattered mercilessly. Hell, you even see a 10-second footage of blood on a floor(with a newspaper crumpled next to it, soaked in blood, just like how the policemen clean all the gore in crime scenes). Gunfire splits your eardrums, and believe me, it's a true-to-life sight.\n\nThe movie begins with a rival gang blowing up a man's house with machine guns and makeshift bombs. The way Kashyap positions his camera and randomly puts in close-up shots of the machine guns followed by an overhead shot of the men firing at the doors of the house reminded me of those stalwarts of slickly violent films, Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese, and Quentin Tarantino.\n\nKashyap's direction is not fast-paced by any means, it is indulgent, it is leisurely-paced and that gives enough room for character development, which is where Kashyap scores, big time. The citizens of Wasseypur are all fleshed out realistically, and the protagonist, a lecher who dreams of revenge and power is too true.\n\nNext up is the performances of the case which is nothing short of phenomenal. Manoj Bajpayee...well, well, not for once did I think that his Bhiku Mhatre would be overshadowed by any other character, but as Sardar Khan, the sadistic, scary and scheming Mafia lord and a lecher to boot, Bajpayee delivers a performance that is worthy of a National Award. Riccha Chaddha as Nagma Khatoon, Sardar's poor wife who has to put up with his frequent extra-marital affairs, is a veritable brimstone who spews abuses and threatens policemen with a sickle> She is arguably the find amongst new actresses in the Hindi film industry. However, the biggest surprise is the performance of Tigmanshu Dhulia as Ramadhir Singh. With restrained emotions and an intense body-language, Dhulia delivers a tour-de-force.\n\nWhat separates this film from the rest of the bullsh*t that the so-called \"Bollywood\" industry spews out, is its subtlety, a device that Kashyap uses to great effect. The scene where Sardar's uncle realizes Ramadhir Singh's plot of killing Shahid Khan(Sardar's father) by recognizing Singh's umbrella, is very effective, because it doesn't shove over-emphasis up your nose. Apart from that, the performances of the case, are not over-the-top, nor are they too wooden. They portray their characters realistically, and underplay them brilliantly, unlike some Srk's some Sallu's and some \"Big B's\" who don't even understand the meaning of the word subtlety. Bajpayee controls his problem of occasional hamming by restraining his emotions perfectly. Kashyap helps, too, with some tight screenplay, not allowing any character to wallow in their grief and breaking out into songs.\n\nOverall, 'Gangs...'is one of those movies that you have to watch, simply because it can easily lay claim with being one of the best movie in gangster genre along with City of God, Godfather trilogy, and Nayagan.\n\nPS: Watch the last scene of the movie, you will be astonished with Kashyap's black comedy."

Welcome to other side of India, so rustic was the ambiance created that you wonder if it is the same India you belong to. I am going to take some time to absorb the stress. To be frank, I desperately need Yash Chopra's goody goody movie dose to clear my hangover.\n\nAs with old Hollywood era, one side there were Tom Hank's feel good movies and other side were Clint Estwood's unadulterated Taxan flick. In Bollywood, we are coming up with good number of nail biting northern rural dramas (Can anyone forget Omkara or Ishqiya.. !). I personally believe these are much much better than latest trend of copying of southern OVER POWERED HERO's movies (does anyone needs Name?).\n\nWhen top notch direction meets with crunchy script a full blown entertainment is sure to be due. And Manoj Vajpai ..who?? (Yes yes yes fair enough.... I still remember Manoj Vajpai of Satya frame) is coming up at his own. There were others (still not able to get their names \uf04c), who were equally impressive. The only disappointment was editing, 20 minutes of cuts could have given GOW a Gem status. But yeah, may be that I can wish for part II. All in all, its treat to watch, if you like Spices more than Sugar ;-)."

An exhilarating movie experience which demands to be seen only on big screen for its rustic visuals which takes you straight into raw and rugged heartland. Very very entertaining as well and humor keeps you to the edge of the seat throughout. At times it reminded me of Sholay on epic, comedy and entertainment level.Though not for people with faint-heart, GOW bleeds excellence in almost every frame and every scene. An epic and brutal saga spanning over decades and generations. Its epic, visceral and poetic all at the same time.\n\nWatching GOW on big screen wasn't just watching a movie but an experience. An experience which also proves Anurag Kashyag as the face of new age Indian cinema after GOW, Black Friday, Dev-d. And how can I forget the brilliant No Smoking which was quite David Lynchish. Manoj Bajpayee is impeccable and irreplaceable in his career best performance.\n\nMusic is fantastic and specially how well the music have been utilized is another USP of the movie. For example the beautiful \"Ik bagal mein chand hoga..ik bagal me rotiya\" from Piyush Mishra. Suddenly the mood and visual of the film changes. The song reminds you of some 50-60's lullaby and how poetically it has been shot reminds you of Bimol Roy's classic \"Do Beegha Zameen\". So many references of the era gone by...from those colorful posters to Bachchan era..to the era of violence and lawlessness of such places..at times it feels like poetry in motion.\n\nJust magnificent...Indian cinema at its best!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Kashyap Brothers are the new Dabangg of Bollywood. This movie will win the Oscar in best foreign language film. This movie will be in the nominations this year. This is bigger and a lot better than Sholay. You can just play the dialogues and enjoy the movie. I have seen this 3 times and want to see it several times by now. As many times I see it I just feel Real and nothing Reel. Its so interesting. As many times I see it I feel that I have seen this character somewhere, I have met these people somewhere. The characters are just > Naam ke Musalman aur Fitrat se Insaan. None of the characters are good at all, they are all bad. But they are giving some core and basic truth about humans and their strength from wherever they do belong (U.P., Bihar, etc.) they are not less than anyone, and they are too connected to the soil.\n\nA lot better than Kahani, Ishqiya, Satya, Peepli Live, or any other this genre of movie. If you can portray so much reality in a movie, then the movie maker is really outstanding. Reality in looks, in language, in expressions, in problems and their solutions. Reality can be more felt when someone is really from these regions of the world. The kind of tension and awkwardness that is shown can be generally felt in these regions.\n\n\"Chaabi Kahan Hai ? Gaand Mein Dali Hai Kya Chaabi, Sala Sab.\" Khee Khee-Khee .. Hee-Hee\n\nMost importantly I liked the posters of the film. They are like I am seeing the covers of 80s and 90s Comics, Manoj Comics, Tulsi Comics etc.\n\nI am waiting for the sequel. \"Jia ho Bihar Ke Lala, Jiya Tu Hazar Sala. Tani Naachi Ke, ...\""

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a great movie buff, one of the greatest around. A great proclivity for cinema I have got. I have been a sincere fan of Martin Scorsese's works, all of them. I believe that a great director can put all the elements of greatness in a movie and make it reach the epitome of cinema. He can set fire to water if there is a natural demand for it. Not the actors, but the directors have always given cinema a turnaround whenever required.\n\nNow, this guy - Anurag Kashyap, is heavily influenced by Scorsese, and may be some other directors too. Being influenced and then delivering beyond imagination is a gargantuan task, only few blessed people can do. The film style and techniques which he carries with himself are rare, almost rare in the Bollywood where some quacks in the name of cinema produce utter rubbish stuffs and beguile the audience of real dimensions of cinema.\n\nLet's quickly talk about the movie. Every dimension of cinema has been given full respect. Everyone's performance is quite commendable. The cinematography is simply amazing. The dialogues are such a bliss to any Bihari ears. Thanks to the God, I have got a pair. A great music to spice up the situations. You know, the music will remind you of Kill Bill. Music has been Tarantino's one of the greatest weapons. Tarantino has also influenced Kashyap. The direction of the movie- let's not talk about that. I have talked a lot already about the director.\n\nOne thing I want to mention particularly. Many directors tried to get into gang-wars, mafia and other stories involving Bihar and U.P. But the level to which this movie takes you has never been achieved earlier. I was just flabbergasted. How could the director boil down to such intricacies? That's the job of a genius, ain't it?\n\nThere were few things I did not like about the movie. The movie needed a little bit more work on editing. The narrator should have been a better one. A powerful voice was what I thought lacked. Also if the movie were little bit peaceful in the first half, it would have been a legend. Remember Taxi Driver. That calmness and that peace. And one thing particularly- it should have been released in one piece despite of any length it had got. But bad things come in twos and here is Bollywood's baddie my friend.\n\nDo not listen to what one says. Just go for it. It will satisfy the voracious you. A perfect roller-coaster ride. And those who follow the quacks I mentioned - please avoid this movie. We do not want such slumps despising something heavenly.\n\nP.S.- Do not watch this movie with your girl otherwise you will end up answering the one and only question throughout the movie. \"What does that mean\"?"

If Slumdog got an Oscar, this should get two. But then again, the Oscar committee may not quite appreciate what is essentially a very Indian backdrop. Actually to tell the truth - North Indian, more specifically Bihari, UP flavor.\n\nBut who cares. The filmfare awards committee should take back all the FF awards given out till date and hand over to GoW. No hyperbole. This movie (should) redefines Indian cinema. Nevermind the average reviews of all the paid reviewers in Indian media. They are about as intelligent as the rest of the bollywood. This movie is AWESOME."

There were only eleven females among 160 audiences. Dialogues are THETH Bihari but enjoyable. Music score is also good especially the Womania...Music has the sweet taste of local folk. Manoj Bajpaye is awesome. One actress as Nagma Khatoon impresses. Rest actors are also good. Actually, casting is perfect. The ambiance, music, casting create the feel that it is real Wassyepur. At the climax the behavior of Durga is not justified. The exaggerated shooting scene at the very beginning of film seems imposed, it was not real, just an attempt to surprise the audience.

This movie relies on a few basic rules that make the majority of Indians go crazy but sadly, I don't see it. Reasons why my friends liked it: 1. Yaar it's cult. 2. That dialog about asking for hand-holding permission was killer. 3. That dialog about his wife asking him to eat well was so funny. 4. That song is epic! 5. Blah blah blah. The story is overly exaggerated (as claimed by some Wasseypur citizens themselves recently) so whoever says it's a REAL movie is welcome to take it up with them or me. It's painfully lengthy and slow. The last scene is too far from reality and only reminds me of Hrithik Roshan in Agneepath. The protagonist hates monogamy and loves sex, which makes Indian men whistle of course. Every second word in the movie is an abuse (again I hear whistles and even louder when the women are abusive). If this is all it takes to make a great movie, look out for my blockbuster tomorrow in a cinema-hall near you. Too many generations, too much of Godfather, excessive confusion, nymphomania, cheapness, vulgarity, abusiveness and gore. This movie was terrible. But please, see for yourself and I hope that some of you will agree with me after experiencing the above yourself. The rest of the GoW lovers, no offence, but your taste is pretty bad in my opinion."

They won't succeed unless they come back to real life. That's why the movie has several subplots, several villains and several protagonist whom you can't vividly call heroes and you can't relate to them. In my opinion all the main characters in the movie are slaves to greed but once they encounter the results of their greed; they repent."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1941 British colonial India, Shahid Khan is robbing trains under the guise of legendary bandit Sultana Daku. He is discovered and banished. After independence, Ramadhir Singh takes over some of lucrative coal mines but they struggle without British managers and money. He hires Shahid Khan as muscle to keep the workers in line. He overhears Shahid's plan to murder him for the mines. He kills Shahid and tries to kill his family. The son Sardar Khan is rescued and raised alongside his cousin Asghar. Decades later, Sardar is told of the murder and vows revenge. Sardar uses daring, intimidation and his criminal ways to take on the powerful magnate Singh as one of the most feared crime lord.\n\nI can definitely see the comparison to the Godfather movies. I really love some parts of this movie. Shahid Khan could be a movie all by himself. In fact, I would preferred his story to be expanded into either part I or a prequel of sorts like in Godfather II. Sardar is a very compelling character. I'm a little confused with some of the family melodrama. The story feels a little rushed covering a long timeline. The whole movie feels like a vast long story being crammed into a space that is too small. If this was Godfather, this would be twice as long in length. This is great brutal violent overwrought material. This is good but it's not quite Godfather epic great."

It is a very long movie, add a slow pace to it and finally get a tantalizing experience. This orphan boy was keen to revenge in a scene while having hug from his woman, on to kill the murderer of his heroic father, and then, somehow lost focus. First fought for the rights of mine against him, then insulted him, then jailed, then escaped. Later went into a political rival against \"him\". Come on!

Shahid Khan is betrayed, and his sons and grandsons swear to avenge his dishonour and death.\n\nReview: This one's a gang bang. Sorry, make that a gang bang-bang; because that's how this story explodes - with bullets, blasts and bust-ups. Throw in gallons of blood, body-counts and 'boom-boom', true Bihari ishtyle. It doesn't need coal to fuel this revenge drama. It fires on Anurag Kashyap's penchant for the dark, dubious, deadly and daring. Starting in 1941, in the dusk of colonial India, in Wasseypur (Dhanbad), the land of coal and scrap trade, simmers an age-old hatred between Muslims and Muslims (Qureshis V/S Pathans). And the bloodbaths, power struggles, family feuds and gang wars rage over three generations.\n\nIn this complex drama, with mobs of men (where you almost forgetkitne aadmi the) and myriad shades (mostly dark), the word to remember is Revenge. And revenge is best served hot, 'koyla' hot! Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat), a good-willed-goonda, impersonates the dreaded Sultana daku (the real Gabbar of colonial India) and loots British trains. Growing gang rivalry compels him to flee his territory, and resettle as a mazdoor in Ramadhir Singh's (Tigmanshu Dhulia) coal mines, where he's betrayed and murdered. But revenge grows in the genes; son Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai), swears (on his bald pate), that he won't grow his mane or rest until he has Ramadhir's blood on his hands. He's a hot-gun really, in bloody war and in bed. While he's married to the feisty and hot-tempered Nagma (Richa Chaddha), who bears him three sons (including Nawazuddin as Faizal), he sleeps around, philanders and marries the doosri aurat, Durga (Reemma Sen); a Bong firebrand, no less. History repeats, in (Francis Ford Copolla's)'Godfather'-style, as the sons-of-Sardar add their meaty parts to this bloody enterprise, of potent men with powerful 'pistols'.\n\nManoj Bajpai, in this fully loaded role, is spectacular. He gustily brings to life Sardar Khan, peaking his performance with devilry, crudity and cuss words, while ably toning it with comic moments and a human touch. Truly, a raw diamond in this coal mine.\n\nIn his acting debut, Tigmanshu Dhulia, with a striking command over his role, is 'bang' on. The real find in this mine-of-a-cast, boy gang film, is Richa Chaddha. She appears like a mini-handmade bomb, but is quite explosive. Reemma Sen, with few dialogues shows her curves and contempt with ease. Piyush Mishra, as the narrator of this long-winding saga (and Sardar Khan's chachha), magnanimously stays in the background, but silently offloads shocking shades of his character.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui, as a pothead son with a devious mind, even in a brief role leaves a solid impact. Director Anurag Kashyap, in his trademark style of story- telling - realistic, with strong characters, over-the-top sequences, and unadulterated local flavour (crude maa-behen gaalis galore), gruesome bloody violence and raw humour - interestingly spins this twisted tale. This first of a two-part film, is ambitious indeed; showing promise of brilliance in parts, but not bullet-proof to flaws. With a runtime this long, meandering side tracks and random sub-plots, countless characters, documentary-style narrative backed with black and white montages from actual history, it loses blood in the second half because of the Director's over-(self)indulgence. The dialogues are 'killer', adding more quirkiness to this chaos. The electric background score (GV Prakash) keeps the tempo in this drama, and the music (Sneha Khanwalkar) though folkish, is hip and cool. But beware; GOW is not for the weak-hearted. So, hold on to your guns, gamchas and 'womaniyas'.Sweeping story of gangs fighting over the coal capital of the country, where rivalry and revenge cut deep, and 'coal'-blooded crimes are second nature.

Movie looked very disjointed to me. The characters didn't seem real. The rise in power of various characters seemed very unnatural to me. Manoj Bajpayee is a good actor but what he did in this movie is same as what he has done in other movies. None of the female characters were impressive except getting a few lines that you would not expect females to say.\n\nI loved Sneha's music in LSD but was somewhat disappointed to hear her music in this movie. There was really no song I can remember from this movie except may be one line \"keh ke loonga\" (loosely translates to \"I will tell and then take your ..\").\n\nDisappointed by part 1 but will wait to see part 2.\n\nJust saw part2 of this movie on DVD. Part2 was really more of part 1 with the next generation involved in killing and philandering. I did not like either parts and was disappointed."

Portraying the crudest forms of social evils, conflicts, vengeance ridden acts, gang wars, class difference, illegal arms and drugs dealing, craze for Bollywood, sexual drives, betrayal, love, lust, hatred, competitiveness, corruption, adulteration and hooliganism, Kashyap's attempt to bring it all in front of the audience just as it really is was nothing less than great. The ensemble cast of Bajpayee, Siddiqui, Chadha, Dhulia, Khan, Mishra, Ahlawat, Rao, Tripathi, Singh and (perhaps the youngest of them...)Kumar acted out their roles with utter realism and conviction by engulfing themselves in hardcore method acting which was so well lubricated by the aptly directed music of Sneha Khanwalker and GV Prakash Kumar which provided a rural score depicting the usual tendencies of villagers to dress up and maintain their hair styles imitating celebrities (mostly if not always- filmstars). The bloody, hostile, vengeance ridden, power hungry portrayals of each and every character is likely to stir you into reality and a much harder and unfortunate version of it then we are acquainted to....Where all the dirt and mug of the society seems to ensemble in the form of abstract commodities. The film feeds even the most minute of details....Owing much to Subodh Srivastava's costume design, Rajeev Ravi's cinematography and the Shrikant Desai-Zubi Johal-Rajiv Sunna trio's makeup. A crime and blood saga, Gangs of Wasseypur deserves a full 5 on 5 according to me."

        "review_title": "Gangs of Wasseypur by Anurag Kashyap",
        "review_detailed_main": "Exploring stories about gangster families, are some of the most interesting ones to be told in the complex way in the literature, movies, television series and video games; to see how these families have started, by moving forward with their activities and then got finished. By even get into some of the bloodiest details, on how some of the members of the family have been pushed to take decisions, when they have to face some conflicts; as most of these decisions can bring inevitable consequences, where the streets would be filled with blood. The auteur filmmaker Anurag Kashyap seems intrigued to tell a story about gangster family, by then exploring how their activities have started, to move forward in different generations and where it would end. After a long time of research and well elaboration on some of the most complicated details, in 2012 came out Gangs of Wasseypur by Anurag Kashyap with Manoj Bajpayee, Piyush Mishra, Jameel Khan, Jaideep Ahlawat, Richa Chadha, Reemma Sen, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Tigmanshu Dhullia, Huma Quireshi, Raj Kumar Yaddav, Pankaj Tripathi, Vineet Kumar Singh and Vipin Sharma. The movie's plot: From the 1940s until in 2000s, a bloody conflict between two family gangsters, would get even more aggressive; as each of their decisions would bring bloody consequences, until it would arrive to an inevitable ending. Usually, to tell such complicated topic would be not easy; especially, to assemble all of the specific details which the story needs to be told in the longest way. From the beginning to the end, the movie would not stop to surprise the audience, for how the corruption of the two family gangsters would be operated in all the way to get powerful; as the story gets more thrilling, when one of the gangster families commits a mistake or even takes a difficult decision, to get some of the most unexpectedly bloody situations. The production designer Wasiq Khan has elaborated the settings with specific details, which would show how the main characters live initially in the poorest places; until they would live in the most ordinary places filled with colors and big space, which there is still dirt inside of them. The costume designer Subodh Srivastava has created costumes, which the shape and the colors have been elaborated, to connect with where the story changes in time through the generations. The cinematographer Rajeev Ravi has captured some of the most essential shots, in every camera movements as well as in every single angle shots; especially by using a dynamic style, to maintain the realism in the story to focus on the dirt which the main characters would face through. The editor Shweta Venkat has created the narration's rhythm, in the most precise to see who the main characters and the supporting ones are; by focusing for which reason they are important, as well as what is going to happen to each of them, when something bloody might happen. The score by Sneha Khanwalkar has been elaborated with musical notes, which balances the exotic style and the electronic one; the score connects with how the main characters would move forward, as well as how the main characters and the supporting ones are described in the specific way. Manoj Bajpayee did an extraordinary performance as Sardar Khan, a ruthless gangster who would form the Khan clan; since he started with his family, he and other members of it would do anything to stay as powerful as possible. Piyush Mishra did an excellent performance as Nasir Ahmed, the cousin of Shadid Khan who narrates the story and he would be always with the Khan clan; he would give specific details, on what direction of the story might take from the beginning to the end. Jameel Khan did a well done performance as Asgar Khan, the cousin of Sardar Khan who would do anything of what is right for the Khan clan. Jaideep Ahlawat did an excellent performance as Shahid Khan, the father of Sardar Khan who tried in all of the way to create an easy life for his family; as he struggles with the job to then face a consequence, which would cause his son to start the criminality. Richa Chadha did an extraordinary performance as Nagma Khatoon, the wife Sardar Khan and mother of four sons; she would be always close to her sons, even her manner can be ruthless in some of the most difficult moments to face. Reemma Sen did an excellent performance as Durga, the second wife of Sardar Khan who initially is a shy character to be innocent; until something would change her, to let an unexpected death happening. Nawazuddin Siddiqui did an extraordinary performance as Faizal Khan, one of Sardar Khan's sons who would initially look to be shy and not as ruthless as just father; until something unexpected happens to Faizal Khan, to be a different person and he would move forward with the criminal activity of his father. Tigmanshu Dhullia did an excellent performance as Ramadhir Singh, a cold politician who commands Wasseypur territory, to be allied with the Qureshi clan; but things would get complicated since the Khan clan started with their activities. Huma Quireshi did a well done as Mohsina, the love interest of Faizal Khan who is supportive of him; even when he is going to take some bloody decisions. Raj Kumar Yadav did an excellent as Shamshad Alam, a young man who has initially his own transport business, to then move forward with iron trading; but when things get complicated, he would face an unexpected conclusion. Pankaj Tripathi did an extraordinary performance as Sultan Qureshi, a member of Qureshi clan and ally of Ramadhir Singh; he would do anything to whatever is necessary, to stop the Khan clan. Vineet Kumar Singh did a well done performance as Danish Khan, one of the sons of Sardar Khan who would marry Shama Parveen; but once Shama Parveen got married with him, she would cause a great rage to her brother Sultan Qureshi. Vipin Sharma did an extraordinary performance as Ehsaan Qureshi, the leader of Qureshi clan who is bonded with Ramadhir Singh; he would do anything, to what is necessary for his purpose. Gangs of Wasseypur is one of the greatest as well as one of the most unique movies of all time, which is filled with realism to be unexpectedly bloody and thrilling."

One can laugh his/her colon out if watching this post full meal. Then again a serious touch remains throughout. All the actors have done a brilliant job.

Set in the city of Wasseypur, India, two rival factions have been fighting each other for many years. We see how the feud began, and how it developed...\n\nBoring and, at 320 minutes, seemingly interminable to the point of being painful. Based on the story outline, the movie had potential: a gangster movie spanning several decades - quite Godfather or Goodfellas-like. However, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Incredibly unfocused with pointless detours and sub-plots. Pretty much just drifts for all those 320 minutes.\n\nA bit (actually, a lot) of editing, and much more focusing on the main plot and the movie could have been interesting.\n\nOn the plus side, the usual Bollywood nonsense of random song-and- dance scenes is kept to a minimum. In fact, no dancing, just singing. The small amount of musical interludes is also a negative in a way. When I saw how long the movie was I figured it was because it had the usual song-and-dance stuff, and I would just fast forward through that. Alas, no such luck."

Anurag Kashyap chose a cast of GOOD actors rather than superstars. Be it Manoj Bajpai, Nawazuddin Siddiqui,Tigmanshu Dhulia, Richa Chadda or Zeishan Qadri(he was not even an actor but acted so well). They deserve every big award. I found this movie even more beautifully directed and acted than The Godfather. This movie sends a message to other movies \"teri keh ke lunga\"............................... I don't think any other movie will influence me more than this one.

        "review_detailed_main": "Every Human being on the earth has different shades/dimensions within themselves. Good, bad, sensitive, insensitive, fear, bravery, jealousy, courtesy, and the list is endless. Unfortunately, majority of the movies we see portray the characters as having only one dimension. And typically Indian Cinema is narrower in this aspect. From Indian cinema perspective there are only \"good\" and \"bad\" characters. Anurag Kashyap, is one of the handful directors, who stick to the fact that, there is nothing like good and bad. It is all about CHARACTERS!!!and each character WILL have multiple dimensions within himself/herself.\n\nKUDOS to the amazingly talented path-breaking director of Indian Cinema, Mr. Anurag Kashyap for giving such an epic movie called \"Gangs of Wasseypur\". Watching this movie is a bliss for a cinema lover. No wonder, it was hugely appreciated at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nGOW is an end-product of a the most impressive story-telling, dialogs, characterizations, background music,casting and all other crafts in film-making!! Every character and the scene is written so wonderfully that, you are glued to the seat throughout the 160 minutes, forget the whole world, and feel as if you are there in the movie and seeing the characters live in front of you.\n\nOf course, it is not for the weak-hearted, as it has brutal violence, which is essential to get the right impact of the severity of the events. There are umpteen number of characters in the movie, and each of them have performed first-rate. They are not glamorous, they appear real. Not just that, the emotions the characters portray, are real, including the abusive language. (yes, indeed they are used in real life). Though the movie, has a native backdrop(Bihar), the theme is universal- REVENGE.\n\nWhat I liked: (I liked every part of the movie, but would like to mention some extra-extra-ordinary things)\n\nManoj Bajpayee's screen presence, is FABULOUS!!\n\nStraight-forward, Bihar-accent-ed powerful dialogs (I felt that aha, I wish I was a Bihari for these 3 hours, to enjoy the dialogs more heart-fully)\n\nTiming of the songs and background music and the variation of these music pieces, elevate the movie to the next level.\n\nWhat I did not like: Nothing!!\n\nSummary: DO NOT MISS!!!\n\nNote: The movie ends at a critical point, and also lays the foundation for the sequel- \"Gangs of Wasseypur-2\", which will hit the screens soon, and I just cant wait to watch that. As per my assumption, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, will be having a major role in the sequence. Nawazuddin, is one of the finest actors, we have. (Recently, you watched him in New York,Kahaani and Paan Singh Tomar. FYI, he will also be playing a major role in Aaamir Khan's Talaash.)"

I am warning people out there that if You like non sense action like bodyguard or some baseless movie sorry sir/ma'am this movie isn't made for you....\n\naccording to me this movie is 1 of the best movie of bollywood till date....anurag gave so much attention to the detailing that you can't just ignore it and every character has given life it's own time to breath.......performance of all actors are awesome and manoj bajpayee is at all time best.....the plot,the story is larger than life and as you all know that this story is based on true story....some people will get shocked after watching this movie that this is the same country that they belong to.....this movie is not made for people who thinks that real India is shown just in 'yash raj films'..............\n\nfor me its the best film ever made"

This is why I watch movies, every once in a while I stumble upon such a masterpiece which moves me to tears. You would feel emotionally drained as if rug had been pulled from under your feet & will take you by surprise. Had it not been a bollywood production this masterpiece would've been in IMDb top 10. Probably the best & most important film from bollywood/Hollywood put together. This film will make anyone think hard about how not to take things for granted and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. The music is worthy of praise too, the raw emotion and feeling is amply conveyed.\n\nA few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement of this film & I felt compelled to write a review soon after watching it. After some persuasion from friends I finally got to see it & have been recommending to others ever since. When it comes to movies I'am quite picky & very hard to please guy. There have been occasions where I have literally walked out of the theatre & times where I felt like I have wasted my time. I often watch movies on solid recommendations & tend to follow certain directors & cast. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is. It is a moving film which will shake you from inside. A real must-see. Amazing story brilliant performances.\n\nVery rarely it happens that movies are made that are very simple in expression but possess monumental appeal this fact is truthfully exemplified in this movie. Enough good things can't be said about this movie. It is undoubtedly one of the best and most moving films ever made. One of the most memorable and wonderful movies of the century. I can't say enough good things about this film I really can't - I mean it. Its one of my personal top ten films of all time. There is not another film more deserving of solid 10/10 in the list than Gangs of Wasseypur. Thank you so so much Mr Anurag Kashyap for having wonderfully put together this incredible masterpiece."

There are innumerable characters who you might easily forget between two scenes, but like with the legendary \"McGuffins\", you can subsist without knowing everything about every character. The story is set in, and is about, Bihar. The language is coarse, but beautiful, as the dialects from up there are. Manoj Bajpai is Sardar Khan who has revenge on his mind. Or so he says, for he takes a longer time ogling at women and impregnating them. If this role were an ocean, he dives into it headlong. If it were bread, he bites into it. No coincidence that his best remembered turn before now was as Bhiku Mhatre in Satya, which too was written by Anurag Kashyap. The setting is young India of the 40s, which grows into an indifferent one of the 2000s. Wasseypur is the cauldron of corruption, violence and disrespect. It is also very colourful. Richa Chadda as Naghma, Sardar Khan's wife is excellent. She gets all the great lines and she thrives on them. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, the most exciting acting talent since Irfan Khan, is the Michael Corleone to Sardar Khan's Don Corleone. He gets very few screen space, but with the promise that the next part of this epic will have him in a key role. If the music and the pace of the film can be kept so, Gangs of Wasseypur 2 is one you would check your local listings for every day."

        "review_detailed_main": "The most important thing for a movie depicting real life events is the characterization. Every character has to fit in to the role he/she is given and kudos to Mr. Anurag Kashyap, he has done exactly as prescribed. The best part about the movie is that it's action and the dark comedy never seemed unreal. The flow of the movie seemed perfect for a blend of action and reality. Acting was just perfect with every actor doing justice to his/her role. Screenplay was gripping with straightforward dialogues and good characterization. The film never seemed to aberrate from its central theme.\n\nOne of the most creative things about the movie was the old book styled beginning. It made the movie look more contemporary to its setting. One huge relief about the movie was that the music was well chosen and well timed. The cinematography was also perfect. The setting of the movie looked very real. Bihar/Jharkhand/Uttar Pradesh, thanks to their governance in last 15 years, have not changed much and that helped a lot to this cause.\n\nThe only negative part about the movie is its language and some gory scenes nevertheless these were inevitable. A movie not advisable to sensitive viewership. A few families were seen leaving the movie theater midway after it got too much for them. Overall the movie is a good watch for them who could take these negatives as a part and parcel of the movie without which it could not have been as good as it is and a value for your money."

It will show you the horror in which people lived during past 60 years in Dhanbad area. Go for awesome acting, music and thrill. Overall, a different and unexpected experience.\n\nPS: For the people in India who feel that taking kids to a R-rated movie is OK for their 'early education', this movie will show you why you should never do that. Grow up and let the kids grow up properly too."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's been a long time since a movie has come in bollywood which would make you say, once more. In the recent times bollywood has tried a lot with super heroes coming and flying, love stories with a western touch, awful sequels and horrifying remakes, but this gem from Anurag Kashyap truly deserves a 25 topo ki salami. The movie is set out in a never heard location where the coal mafia and our sweet politics have tied hands. It starts of in the past when the Britishers ruled the nation, and how when they left the whole game of mining changed. The characters of Sultana Daku have been highlighted with strong history and then remade into the world by Shahid Khan(Jaideep Ahlawat). He was killed by his own recruiter Ramadhari Singh who owned the mines after independence, and then set the whole story for the minutes to come ahead. Sardar Khan(Manoj Bajpayee) the protagonist, the son of Shahid Khan and the to be mafia of Wasseypur is all burning with the fire of revenge as he comes to know about his father's death on to the hands of Ramadhari singh. He cleverly enters the campaign of former and slowly gathers power, money and prestige to play against him. But he was not his only enemy, the movie brings out another revenge seeker group of Qureshi's. Revenge, humor, strong performances and situation-ally accurate music hold the key for you to bear the 165 min long drama of Anurag Kashyap. Backed by the stupendous story of revenge, the director has been more than successful in delivering an experience not to be forgotten for a long time. The direction and screenplay are the highlights of the film which have bring out the true essence of the melodrama. All the characters have not just performed but have lived them. Not even a single moment comes when you will feel, oh i have seen this or what the hell is this. All in all it's a movie whose all characters have a strong impact to the way it progresses much like the greatest epic of Sholay, not that I in any way want to compare it with the latter but this movie would make you feel that the bollywood is reviving and the Hollywood will get tough competition in future."

The disjointed plot is not helped when you can't keep track of who is who and what is what due to the subtitles.\n\nBut even just stepping back from the film and watching it unfold, the plot is incoherent, the characters and acting are wooden, the production values are weak. Full of tired tropes. Lingering scenes big portions of which should have been left on the cutting room floor. At the end, the doesn't seem to be any point to it all. And the \"action\" is in no way thrilling enough to just be a gripping gangster drama. Despite being made this century, it has all of the feel of a B-movie spaghetti western of half a century ago."

I did a really really lot of research of those Bihar gang wars and have concluded that the film tells 75% of the truth....moreover HATS HATS off to my favourite director ANURAG KASHYAP SIR for excellent cinematography (that hawk-eye view of filming !!!), filming, screenplay, story and the whole package.....and of-course to the reality in the film that he has shown... And lastly I want to say that this film changed my life...after this film released, I started watching only sensible and reality films...THANKS TO SIR A. KASHYAP...!

The story basically talks about the gang war in Wasseypur & Dhanband (Jharkhand) starting from 1950s till present. It presents the glimpses of coal mafia raaj and war for contracts among bahubalis. The movie flow is such that you'll never get bored. The movie'll have part two also. But this movie being part one also is a complete package of entertainment. I am not telling the complete story as I don't wanna spoil the real fun waiting for you. SO rush to your theatres asap. Again I would say a masterpiece by Anurag Kashyap."

Timanshu was only known as good director. After watching GoW, i say he is much better actor than a director. Piyush Mishra proved why he deserves respect in the industry. Great dialogues. Teri keh ki luga,,, tumse na hoga Beta... Great Street music:: This movie is a career change for Nawazuddin, Richa, Hema Qureshi. I want to see all of them again."

Therefore movie has placed lots of different places and areas that took place. And because of that you may not get bored for length. But script has nothing original. I really don't know if characters are from real life or real events, but it doesn't matter movie should offer something more.\n\nAgain this is not a bad movie and movie makers give great effort for it but it is mostly relevant for India.

Matching and sometimes overshadowing actor like Manoj Bajpayee isn't that easy but you do it with such an ease. Piyush Mishra : The role disappointed me a lot. Wanted to see more of this brilliant actor. Nawazuddin : M w8in fr that second part, where you play the protagonist, cuz I believe you can play any role after Kahaani :)\n\nCons : 1. Length. Some people may find it tiring to digest 2.40 hrs long movie. 2. Some background songs have been recorded on a high volume, which irritates the viewers sometimes.\n\nPros: 1. Anurag Kashyap 2. Manoj Bajpayee 3. Richa Chadha 4. Mast music"

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, Gangs of Wasseypur. Let me indulge in a few truisms. Yes, this is the greatest Hindi film of our generation. 'Godfather meets Park Chan Wook' will be an unfair tag, and so will be to draw parallels with Tarantino or any other global contemporaries. This magnum opus is SO Indian, and only the genius of Anurag Kashyap could deliver an uninhibited, arrogant, dark, brutal, savage, larger-than-life revenge drama, taken to dizzying heights of cinematic brilliance that induces extreme emotional orgasm. No conscience-talks, no unnecessary moralizing. The screenplay by Zeishan Queresi is a knockout as it successfully merges history with fiction, beautifully captures the socio-political fabric of rustic India with a historical commentary which provides more authenticity. The humour is out-of-this-world loud and bloody brilliant, expletives galore - unabashed, unapologetic. Rajiv Ravi's camera work is the best I've seen in Indian Cinema in a long, long time and sets a benchmark difficult to emulate. Sneha Khanwalkar's background score is a killer and the songs often add to the narrative. Now, coming to the actors - all of them are outstanding, I'm at a loss for words! The subtlety of Jaideep Ahlawat and Piyush Misra, the feisty and sensuous female characters amidst the male brigade sparkle, Tigmanshu Dhulia's spectacular debut....However, everyone is overshadowed by the pothead-turned-Michael Corleone Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Manoj Bajpai is reborn. As Rajeev Masand says - \"It's difficult to separate the actor from the character.\" With a single-minded unmitigated and unflinching determination for vengeance, his quirky humour, lecherous glances, penchant for the theatrical grandiose - he's the driving force of this film."

Each and every actor is simply brilliant in their role whether they have a screentime of an hour or only of five minutes. And the lead characters - you get to live them in this movie, such is its brilliance. The combined effort of the actors, writers and of course the director Anurag Kashyap simply make this movie perfect. Coming to the soundtrack, it simply fits into the movie. It fits the characters and adds to the perfection of the movie. This movie is the PERFECT movie and will certainly be held as an all time classic in the coming years."

It was because they were building the story but in part 2 every second was full of suspense. So much killing, so much lust, so much love. One of the best things about the movie was that the cinematography was so real. Since the movie is made in India but they have portrayed some community of Muslims exactly. The scenes in the movie where \"Shia\" were lamenting and beating themselves were so real. This practice is done by most Muslims as it is. Moreover, my two favorite characters were \"SULTAN\" and \" Faizal. \" hats off to the actors because they played the role so well that in the end, I am praying for the death of SULTAN. Because he had done enough to family members of Sardar. I have no words for the movie. It is a must-watch movie for viewers who are looking for action and thrill."

Everything was stellar, the acting, the cinematography, the music was pretty dope throughout! I know bollywood by reputation, and this movie has none of its traits. I'm not going to say it's a masterpiece, 8.2 is still an inflated score, but you will not be bored for 2 minutes in this 5h20m colossus, and in my book it is because of that unmatched by any other mafia film ever made. The Godfather is a snooze fest, and Scorsese's movies, while fantastic in their own rights, still had a lot of dead air. This is pure, undistilled action and just thinking about what it took to film all of it makes me a bit nauseous. Kudos just for that. I'm not even that big of a fan of action, I'm just perplexed by the sheer feat of achieving that! Story is engaging, characters are relatable, even though they're all complete REDACTED (another feat unto itself) and while the events aren't completely true, I still love learning the actual history that inspired them, similar, perhaps not coincidentally, to Gangs of New York."

This film is for sure an epic just coz the scale is too grand to weave a script. It spans across 60 decades from 1941 to 2004. It starts at 2004 in beginning and ends in mid 1990's and there are many references o show us the age. If radio was heard or Trishul being seen in cinemas or to Kyu Ki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu This is authentic and great many kudos to Rajeew Ravi the cinematographer and the production design of Wasiq Khan who brought alive the 1970's the 80's and yes even the 40's. Just an aberration here Trishul was released in 1979 while it was shown to be as 1989.\n\nMusic was raw and pleasant and even philosophical like song of Ik Bagal Main, to a silly yet hilarious song like I am Hunter, Sneha Khanwalkar adds a voice to the already interestig script. The audiography is good and so is the voice of Piyush Mishra as he says the back story behind what was happening on screen.\n\nBut the most interesting of all is the script itself that is driven by Sardar Khan played by Manoj Bajpai and by Ramadhir Singh played by Tigamanshu Dhulia, its their rivalry and how they deal with this. So instead of killing simply each other, they decide to tell and take\n\n\"Keh Ke loonga Uski\"\n\nThe dialogues are witty and the violence is gruesome. All in all, its a gory depiction of a true incidents told entertainigly. Kudos to Anurag Kashyap the pioneer of great Indian Cinema for making it in this way.\n\nThere is a scene in which Sardar Khan tries to open the door by smashing with his legs and hands and screaing while his aide simply opens the bolt and says \"Yeh aise khulta hai\" such moments are what made this revenge drama witty and hirlaious. It's sarcastic one may say as it makes a mockery too of few things, yet it's not cynical but intelligent.\n\nManoj Bajpai might well win many Best Actor awards or at least be nominated to many. Anurag Kashyap for sure is the best director yet again and I hope he wins the elusive best director award at least this time.\n\nA 4/5 for movie that is made like an epic. There are many characters still there is a connect that keeps us glued even in a repeat watch."

The tussle between Pathans and Qureshis, and that between Shahid Khan and Sardar Khan on one side and Ramadheer Singh and his son on the other side are the highlights of the movie. In between, one also sees different facets of coal mafia, revenge, rivalries among Muslims, and even love stories too. The movie is intense, gripping, and has a fair sprinkling of cuss words one finds in Bihar and Jharkhand, where the film is based. The music of the film is another highlight, and one needs to watch the film to fully realize the relevance of songs in the film. In short: a must- watch movie for those who love hard hitting movies with great acting from all the actors."

The way each character is introduced is terrific. It is story telling at its best. From Shahid Khan to Sardar Khan to Sultan, you actually end up fearing them all - the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Manoj Bajpai is amazing as Sardar (he really got into the character) and the narration (by one of the gang members) adds a lot of flavor to the entire flow of the movie.\n\nSiddiqui's role is brief in the first part and I have a feeling he will play a major role in the remaining part of this epic. He is already looking good. Tigmanshu as Ramadheer Singh is terrific, his expressions too good.\n\nApart from this, the movie is informative - it very subtly tells the audience all about the way Indian coal mafia has progressed over the years, the gang wars, the politics. Obviously there is a lot of slang. I have not seen a Hindi movie with so crude a language ever, absolutely not recommended for family viewing and children/teenagers."

        "review_detailed_main": "Part 1 review:\n\nI don't say this lightly, but I think this might be (part 1 of) the best crime epic of the 21st century so far. When you look at the best gangster movies of the 20th century, it's not far behind those either (The Godfather, Goodfellas, Once Upon A Time in America etc).\n\nIt feels influenced by some American crime movies in some areas, but does its own thing with familiar tropes and beats, twisting them into something bold and original. It feels like it has influences, but never feels derivative or uninspired. At two and a half hours, the pacing is perfect, and I like how efficiently it sets up Part 2, which is even crazier and more eventful than the first.\n\nNothing else I've seen by Anurag Kashyap since has worked for me quite as well as this, but I do love revisiting Gangs of Wasseypur and getting more and more out of him. The first two times I watched it, I could follow it while being a little overwhelmed at times, but now I'm familiar enough with the story to keep up and fully appreciate it (and I also appreciate seeing it sow seeds that will sprout in Part 2).\n\nPart 2 review:\n\nThis one picks up directly after the violent cliffhanger that ended Part 1, and as such, it really hits the ground running. Part 1 was a fast-paced film, but I think Gangs of Wasseypur Part 2 takes that fast pace to another level altogether. It's absolutely relentless, and most scenes last one or two minutes at the most (the more important ones naturally are more drawn-out, often to great effect).\n\nPart of that faster, more frantic feel comes from how sprawling the movie gets. There are more side characters here who all get a good deal of screen-time, and while it's sometimes jarring to suddenly have new people introduced, I think it ends up working and coming together well. It also ties into the theme of this second part: the somewhat meta idea that everyone involved in the crime game in Wasseypur believes they're the hero of their own story, and that sense of ego or self-importance can often lead to one's downfall.\n\nSpeaking of downfalls: there's a lot of that here. There were plenty of deaths in Part 1 (and at least a couple you might not see coming), but Part 2 is ruthless, and so often, death comes so quickly - and to such major characters - that you almost don't believe it really happened. It drives home the violent world of the film, and makes the story constantly tense and suspenseful.\n\nGreat action, an interesting meta element, strong music, some much-needed (though dark) comedic relief, and consistently great visuals (the use of colour is phenomenal) leads to a great Part 2; one I think I like even more than Part 1. I'm always blown away every time I revisit Gangs of Wasseypur, and always find new things to like and appreciate. Each part forms a 5-hour-long whole that absolutely stands as one of the best crime films of the 21st century so far."

All the dialogues, behavior, characterization was properly etched. None of the performance of any actors looked like they are over acting. The film received an Adults Only certification from the Indian Censor Board but is still unusually explicit for Indian standards as it contained authentic lingo and violence generally suppressed by Mainstream Indian movies.The films soundtrack is heavily influenced by traditional Indian folk songs. So if you want to experience an all new wave of cinema in Bollywood, GOW is your movie. It's has some real quirky moments which I'll leave for you to explore in the film. Watch it for its sheer cinematic pleasure! Always an Anurag Kashyap fan. Aapne \"Keh k le li\""

The beauty of the movie is that there is no single hero in this movie. Each character is imperfect and yet lends to the whole that is the movie.\n\nWhile the language may be abrasive and the expression rustic, the movie as a whole delivers an experience. Manoj Bajpai delivers a stupendous performance as Sultan Khan, but that can be said of all the others in this movie as well.\n\nJust a warning though.

I saw the entire 5+ hours of this movie in one go at the osian's film festival last night (4th Aug 2012). I have seen a lot of movies from the international cinema and have always wondered about when will India throw such movies out. I wanna put my hands down and say that finally India has thrown one. This movie is as cult as it gets. You get to see the real India and real characters on screen. Usually when I see an Indian movie I keep comparing it with the English/foreign movie that I saw and 90% of the times the scripts are copied/semi-copied. For Gangs of Wasseypur I couldn't really think of any movie that comes close to this. The script is as original as it gets. If at all I have to give a summary of what this movie is like then here it is. It has the seriousness and character of GodFather, the plot as tricky and mind blowing as that of 2009 Oscar winning movie \"The secret in their eyes\" , \"The departed\" or Incendies. The acting doesn't get any real than what these guys have put up. I though de niro in \"The Raging bull\" was the best acting I ever saw, but I was left numb after seeing Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Faizal in this movie. You name any character and you know Anurag has not left anything for chance. Even a doctor who had a role for 15 seconds was bang on with dialogues and emotions. This movie brought a tear to my eye not because of some emotional scene in the movie but simply because I wanted India to produce an epic or a classic that the world can see and yes I can say this is it !"

        "review_detailed_main": "Anurag Kashyap stands for the rebel in Indian cinema. He knows it too. Black Friday, Dev.D, Gulaal give him every reason in the world to be proud of his tag. This feeling is clearly reflected in Gangs of Wasseypur, which turns out to be his most ambitious & financed project ever. He works with his long-time friends, Manoj Bajpayee, Tigmanshu Dhulia and others, deciding to make a film which does not fall into the clich\u00e9 of other commercial films. An epic film that tells the story of violence originating through monopoly of coal mines in North India but later feeds itself off the ego of proud descendants of their brave forefathers.\n\nIt is as difficult to loathe this film as it is to hate history lessons taught through audio-visuals. The story takes us in, helping us to absorb the details. It starts in one era, moves to another, shows familiar black & white clips, returns to some other era before finally falling on a linear time-line. Characters, places, eras are introduced either by text or the voice-over by Piyush Mishra who plays the uncle to a revenge-vowing bald Sardar Khan (Bajpayee, excelling himself like never before) who's father Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat, strong screen presence) was killed off by his employer Ramadhir Singh (Dhulia, another remarkable work). Yes, it is difficult to follow the names but fairly easier to remember the faces. The characters develop beautifully through the plot. I wasn't bored at any point, maybe could have watched the second part too.\n\nKashyap's screenplay stresses more on the plot than the characters. He makes lovable characters throughout the film but has no mercy on them. For instance, the revenge-vowing lead is unashamed of his libido and sleeps around which his wife (Richa Chadda) eventually comes to terms with, which one would would not usually expect (there are numerous other examples with almost every character which would kill the suspense, if mentioned). But these are heartless gangsters which you would feel no sympathy for if you heard about them on the news. This Godfather-esque play of values which have been used time and again in movies makes you expect more from the film as it moves on. Sadly, it doesn't deliver the expected punch as the characterizations lead to digressions in the plot rather than help it move forward.\n\nThen again, how do we fall in love with a movie knowing that whole genealogical parts can be comfortably replaced by sporadic lines of reminiscence? And what exactly goes wrong in this movie that boasts of a strong ensemble of actors, a terrific earthy music score (Sneha Khanwalkar) and spot-on cinematography (his regular, Rajeev Ravi)? It is not hard to see the bits & pieces of frustration (that oozed in No Smoking (2007)) in the ambitions and grandeur of Gangs... Kashyap was in the past forced to tone down Black Friday (2004) by Censors and has not yet been allowed to release his first film Paanch. Maybe, this time around, he decided that not cutting down at all on the partly mundane details would enhance the epic-quotient of the film. It does not. However, the trailer and characters for GoW-Part 2 are 'definite'ly more interesting.\n\nPS: I'm a die-hard Kashyap fan and it pains me to not be able to fall in love with his movie. But this is certainly, not his best.\n\n7/10"

Gangs of Wasseypur stands firmly on the grounds of Direction, Acting, Screenplay, Story-line, Cinematography, Music & off course The BEST Dialogues. Outstanding performance by Manoj Bajpayee, Richa Chaddha an Nawaz-ud-din Saddiqui. An epic tale about loyalty, crime, lust, treachery and vendetta.

The honesty in depiction of a story with suitable characters and adherence to the plot. 2. Not succumbing to the temptation of attracting large family audience to earn more money. 3. Showing what is exact, without any cosmetic changes.\n\nAnurag Kashyap had to include some necessary 'entertaining' moments to hold the audience, but it didn't look a deliberate attempt and indeed mingled well with the plot.\n\nGoW talks about a revengeful attitude that percolates to many generations. There are villages in India where this attitude stays for decades as the political struggle for domination over masses continues aided by weak law and order situations."

Kashyap, known for off-beat films, this time attempts to deliver a story that can be termed as his most \"commercial\" flick to date. And even though this 1st installment isn't flawless, its absorbing & supremely acted nevertheless.\n\n'Gangs of Wasseypur' Synopsis: A son seeks vengeance when his father is killed by a coal mine owner.\n\n'Gangs of Wasseypur' is violent, abusive & fearless. Kashyap delivers a revenge story, that literally has shock value. 'Gangs of Wasseypur' runs for a long 160-minutes, but manages to arrest its viewer attention on several occasions.\n\nKashyap's Screenplay begins tepidly, but picks up rapidly. The Second-Hour, in particular, is absorbing & memorable. Kashyap's Direction is Masterclass. Cinematography is rustic. Editing is sharp. Music by Sneha Khanwalkar is excellent.\n\nPerformance-Wise: The Ever-Terrific Manoj Bajpai is marvelous yet again. As Sardar Khan, The National-Award-Winning Actor pitches in an unforgettable turn, that's sure to be remembered for a long time. Director-Turned-Actor Tigmanshu Dhulia is fantastic. He's menacing to the core! Piyush Mishra is natural, while Richa Chadda & Reemma Sen are very good. Jaideep Ahlawat is terrific in a brief role. Pankaj Tripathi is simply outstanding. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is perfect, yet again. Vipin Sharma is efficient. Huma Qureshi is first-rate. Others lend support.\n\nOn the whole, 'Gangs of Wasseypur' is worth a watch."

Certainly, the Hero of this film assures us that if you have good taste then you'll surely find my work delicious and ahead is a great scope for great cinemas.

I think these people are equally competitive when it comes to International Cinema.\n\nThe actors in the film were at par with powerhouses, especially Manoj Bajpayee, Nawaz, Richa Chaddha, Pankaj Tripathi and Tigmanshu Dhulia. The script was so well researched.\n\nI saw the Making of the film which was released last month, and it was such a wonderful experience watching it too. I came to know that both the parts were made in a very tight budget of 18 crore, which is certainly an impossible thing to be done by Dharma and Yashraj. It was so kind of Mr. Kashyap to let us take a look at some of the tricky scenes and shots of the film.\n\nThanks for Such an Unforgettable Cinematic Experience."

        "review_title": "A shut-up call to the word 'parallel cinema'",
        "review_detailed_main": "I have a serious reservation against the terms 'parallel cinema' or 'art movies'. These terms are used to confine some dazzling cinematic experiences to selected audience. Why do people go to watch movies? For romance? For great music? For action? For sex? For humor? Would you go to watch a movie that has all the four things in it? Probably not. You will call it an 'art movie' because it does not have a Khan or a Kapoor or a Kumar in it. Instead it has Manoj Bajpai in his finest performance ever. Yes, even better than Satya and that's a lofty claim.\n\n'Gangs of Wasseypur' (GoWp) is a shut-up call to the word 'parallel cinema'. This is a pure commercial film with everything a marketable film has. Its romance does not have huge silk curtains flying in the background coupled with violins. Its romance means the girl asking the guy to seek permission before holding her hand while sitting in front of a dirty lake. No, its action does not have shots of the hero jumping from Burj Khalifa or fancy car chases. It has gory action where fingers are chopped off and swords and daggers define weaponry. It's sexy but not in a bikini and beach way but for the rawness of a man's lust and woman's quest for security in his lust.\n\nIts music is fabulously done by the unique Sneha Khanwalkar (Love, Sex Aur Dhoka & Oye Lucky Lucky Oye) but it does not have lip synching choreographed with hundreds of kids dancing along with the lead couple. Instead it has songs like \"Keh Ke Loon Ga\" (I'll tell you first and then screw you) playing in the background when the protagonist, if he can be called that, goes after the antagonist.\n\nIn fact, background music is the strength of GoWP jointly shared by Sneha and the brilliant Piyush Mishra. Both for performance and music, Mishra has started just where he left from in Gulal. How fitting is a song like 'Ik Bagal Mein' that expresses the feeling of one happiness coming with one sorrow in the background of scenes like a man uncertain of celebrating the birth of his son when his wife dies during childbirth.\n\nGoWP is not epitome of story writing. The basic premise of 'if a Hindu wants to rule, he gets two Muslims to fight with each other' is subtle yet bold enough to raise eye brows. The story is a simple 'Karma is a bitch' saga where a son challenges the political powerhouse to avenge his father's killing. It sounds like a run of the mill 80s revenge story or even The Godfather. Rest assured, that its not. It also kills the rumors that it's an inspiration from the Brazilian film \"City of God\" because its not that either. The only similarity between GoWP and City of God is the power struggle between two gangs. The milieu and the events are totally different from each other.\n\nIt's the treatment and pragmatism that makes this film special. There can be a lot of criticism on making it an expletives ridden violent heavy 160 minutes, but the fact remains that expletives are as much a part of our lives as breathing is. You cannot expect goons of Bihar to talk to each other like cultured Lucknow literary geniuses.\n\nGoWP has perfect casting. Every single character has come out with individual brilliance no matter how trivial his or her role is. It's impossible to pick out someone who did not do well. The only differentiating factor between the actors is the length of their screen presence be it Jaideep Ahlawat as Shahid Khan or Jameel Khan as Asgar Khan or Reema Sen as Durga. Richa Chadda as Manoj Bajpai's wife is a surprise show stealer. Another surprise package is Pankaj Tripathy who gets the biggest role of his career and grabs it with both hands. The talented story teller Tigmanshu Dhulia (Haasil, Shagird and Sahed Biwi Aur Gangster) puts down his pen and comes in front of the camera for one of the strongest performances in the film. His anger management and cunningness is remarkable. Piyush Mishra, the name is enough. Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Huma Qureshi are perfect in their roles and will get more exposure when the sequel revolves around them.\n\nThe film, however, belongs to Manjo Bajpani. From Bhikku Mahatre to Sardar Khan, take a bow. He is hungry, he is horny and he is humorous. He is everything you don't want your enemy to be but he is scared of his wife and admits that in front of his son. He doesn't remember his father but he remembers the revenge. He is a mercenary with an objective of his own. Jiya ho bihar ke lala.\n\nThis is Anurag Kashyap's finest work to date. He has overcome the criticism of using intricate metaphors (Gulaal) and unfathomable links (No Smoking) or making films ahead of their time (Dev D). He has kept the narration simple to make sure no one leaves the theater in confusion. The killing scene of Shahid Khan reminds you of Bhikku Mahatre's death in Satya. A powerful man can go down in a jiffy. It was Kashyap's dream project and his passion shows in the entire film.\n\nIt's important for the economics to work in favor of films like GoWP which was not a case for 'Gulal' and 'That girl In Yellow Boots'. With satellite rights apparently fetching half of the film's cost and a decent theatrical start in India, looks like Kashyap has finally covered that bit which will also help the sequel of this film.\n\nGoWP is a proper adult audience movie. There are people who will not like it. Those are the people who will not go to watch it. Whoever does, will have a hell of a ride and will go for the sequel as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bloody Brilliance in every scene throughout the run time. It ensures to shock and delight the audience simultaneously. Its Anurag Kashyap's best work till date after \"Black Friday\". It's a break through in Indian main stream cinema. I feel myself blessed for being a audience to this quirky, dark, highly amusing and straight on the face brilliant Film.\n\nThe Cast, Sneha Khanwalkar's music, the direction, dialogues, script, the comic timings and the gore takes this movie to a next level. It's a revenge story spanned across 3 generations. The story is based in Wasseypur, a dingy small hammock near Dhanbad where the coal mafia reigns. Its not a place for weak hearted. Country made guns blaze anywhere anytime, bombs are hurled as its cricket balls being played in gullies. Assassins throw bombs & fire bullets while riding rustic bikes.\n\nEvery Scene takes you to height of various emotions a person can feel. The best scene was the opening scene where \"Saans bhi kabhi bahu thi\" opening credits play and slowly it zooms out and we see that it is being played on a TV. And suddenly dozens of men running the gully firing AK- 47 & hurling bombs. This action sequence is so brilliantly shot that you will feel it's a Hollywood flick. There was another scene where a girl is complaining to Sardar Khan that few guys are eve teasing her. While listening to the girl Sardar Khan's eyes are on revealed back of Durga. The expression in his eyes was full of lust. The expression was so original & comic.\n\nAll the characters were so believable. The characters look just as normal people we see around all the time. The entire cast of the film has delivered a commendable performance. Manoj Bajpai's character Sardar Khan was dark, amoral, lecherous, merciless yet highly amusing. Richa Chaddha character as Sardar khan's wife portrays a fearless woman of strength, helplessness. The star cast was heavenly made for each character. Manoj Bajpai proved that he is one of the best actors India has got. He was bloody brilliant. Richa Chaddha was equally brilliant. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Jameel Khan, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Pankaj Tripathy were apt and great in their performance. \"Gangs of Wasseypur\" is one film where everybody's performance was exceptional.\n\nThe movie ends teasing and the audience wants some more of it. Its not the end. It is followed by second part. And it will be definitely awaited eagerly by all who has had the fortune of watching the first part."

The movie is abstract in its kind and the plot is quite raw. Manoj Bajpai steals the dhow with touch of brilliance from Tigmanshu Dhulia. Excellent se bhi upar SUPER excellent movie! Anurag should continue what he does best! The story traces its background to the 'bahubali' era of Bihar and easily narrates the rise of criminals in politics. Richa Chaddha is perfect for the bold role. Every scene in the film has a meaning and it shapes the movie pretty well. the ending could have been better though. Music by Sneha Khanwalkar is very good. specially the 'Womaniya' song. Manoj Tiwari takes the song Jiya ho Bihar ke lala to the next level with his lively voice. Overall a great movie, a genre which should be encouraged in India."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've always heard praise for the Gangs of Wasseypur duology but never got around to actually watching them. But now that I've seen both of the parts, I think it's safe to say that it's one of the better gangster films (or in general) I've seen in a WHILE, especially from India. The story is a gigantic mess, but in a good way. There are uncountable characters, each with his/her own motivations, living in a small world where the notion 'the survival of the fittest' reigns supreme. One might get lost in this giant maze but trust me, it all ties in together perfectly. The plot and storyline in the 2 parts are quite different but are connected in regards to the subject matter. Part 1 deals with Shahid Khan, his exploits, his alliance and subsequent murder at the hands of Ramadhir Singh. His son, Sardar Khan, his own thirst for vengeance and assassination are also explored. The latter lays the foundation for the Part 2, which deals with the repercussions of Sardar's death on Wasseypur and the neighbourhood in an increasingly tense and politically-charged climate. Sardar's son, Faizal Khan, along with a bunch of new characters, is introduced in the second part. Both of the parts are adroitly written and combine the traditionality of Western gangster films with Indian eccentricity. The scenes are quirky and clever, traits which have become hallmarks of Anurag Kashyap, who has managed to direct films of such lengthy runtimes without either of them feeling like a slog. (Part 1&2 are both 2hr 30mins+) This proficiency can be attributed in part to the PHENOMENAL acting. If I'm not hyperbolic enough already, I will go on and say that much of the cast gave their career-best performances. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Manoj Bajpai, Richa Chadha, Jaideep Akhlawat all were stellar. Pankaj Tripathi and Rajkummar Rao were great early-bets and in retrospect, it's not surprising to see how well they acted even in the relative infancy of their careers. Definite highlights, even though Rajkummar has a somewhat insignificant but unforgettable role. Besides that, the cinematography and camerawork are really on-point. The cinematography complements the storyline in a great way, matching the quirky-ness and off-kilter humour of the script. Shots are easy-to-follow but never complacent. They're engaging and portray the tone the films are aiming for perfectly. The cinematography is atmospheric and embodies the rural environment with all its nuances. The gunpowder and cigarette smoke shroud the film in an air of 'trippiness' or psychedelia. Similarly, the music and background score are so damn good. The 70s-80s songs accurately represent the cultural zeitgeist of that time, while also holding relevancy to the movie itself. The scenes are generally in-sync with the tunes at play. Cinema itself is a somewhat major part of the residents of Wasseypur and this gives Part 2 a rather meta vibe, especially with all the pop-culture references peppered all over. Gang-violence, anti-heroism, regional politics and the overarching theme of endless gangster lifestyle are deftly handled in both the films. The eternal saga of pain and suffering at the hands of the powerful and the exploitative is portrayed along with how actions of the latter have ripple effects on society culturally, socially and economically. The desperation from living-at-the-edge is a recurrent theme, which gives a lot of depth to the films. Ultimately, it was quite an experience watching the two films! One might accuse them of being vulgar, socially irresponsible and morally corrupt but that's just the way it is. Gang of Wasseypur series is an unapologetic representation of the insane lives of countless individuals living at the fringes of society. The many components of GOW come together to make a well-oiled machine, that's as uncompromising as it is epic in size."

If any movie got so much popularity, then creators put it into premium section, but this thing is not done with this movie and i am glad to watch a great content without any cost.\n\nPRESENTATION - the way this movie tells the story of past to present is quite good.\n\nGANG BATTLES - not the physical battles, but how the politics had run between gangs is interesting and amazing to watch.\n\nI like, how they create plan, fought mental battles, deal with gun suppliers etc.\n\nREALISTIC - this movie doesn't feel like a movie. While watching it, i felt that this thing was happening in my neighbourhood. In other words, it is so realistic. Creators don't dramatise anything. We can easily connect with characters. The perfect phrase for this movie may be \"down to earth\".\n\nDIALOGUES - i think i don't have to tell anything about dialogues. The dialogues from this movies are so popular. At present, you can found them in every 2nd meme.\n\nSONGS - the thing which i loved most about this movie is its song. They are so amazing and perfectly attached to visuals. Seriously, now i am unable to express my feelings about songs.\n\nACTING - in field of Acting, everyone gives their best except some characters. I mean, what would you expect from a trio of pankaj tripathi, manoj bajpayee, nawazuddin siddaqui.\n\nSARDAR KHAN - i love this character. From acting, design, dialogues, story, attitude, to its development of this character is amazing. Specially the design, i never expected to see a bald version of manoj in badass form.\n\nCHARACTER DEVELOPMENT - this thing is also done well. Each and every character got its time perfectly according to their roles.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY - this thing is not so good in this movie, but at the end of the movie, when sardar khan was coming out of the car - this scene changed my opinion about its cinematography.\n\nNegatives\n\nWRONG THINGS - i know that this is only a movie. But, children or even adults nowadays including me are easily influenced by this kind of movies. This movie promotes many immortal and illegal activities, like gang war, Objectified women, murders, misuse of power etc.\n\nSEQUENCE - i noticed many times that, the sequence of this movie is bit broken in some areas. You can easily recognise them. I mean, when i expect to see that scene for long, suddenly they fade out the screen and started a new scene.\n\nNARRATION - the narration of the movie is useful for understanding the story. But sometimes, it was extended for a long time which becomes boring to me.\n\nSARDAR KHAN - there are so many opportunities, where sardar khan can be easily murdered, but for extending the movie or for building a climax, creators leave that thing. But while watching movie, this thing will raise question in your mind.\n\nWOMAN - in so may scenes, this movie demoralized women which is a wrong thing. But on the other hand, it is also an aspect of realistic approach. Still they showed this so many times which can give Negative motivation to the viewers.\n\nENDING - no doubt that ending was amazing. But if you watch movie carefully from the start, you can easily predict the ending soon. There is no such big twist in the story."

The entire story is set in a very restricted locality (in and around Wasseypur and Dhanbad, except brief Varanasi sequences) and in specific periods of time but the themes it handles are thorougly universal in both time and space.\n\nIt may be argued that violence is aestheticized to an adamant degree but it is for granted that it is never gratuitous.

I think this is a magnificent system, a microcosm of the entire history of modern India. After the end of British colonial rule, India acquired the entire system left over by Britain, but lacked the ability to implement it. Under the background, the rise and fall of the three generations of family vengeance show the reality of the entire India."

From Shahid Khan to Sardar Khan to Sultan, you actually end up fearing them all - the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Manoj Bajpai is amazing as Sardar (he really got into the character) and the narration (by one of the gang members) adds a lot of flavor to the entire flow of the movie.\n\nSiddiqui's role is brief in the first part and I have a feeling he will play a major role in the remaining part of this epic. He is already looking good. Tigmanshu as Ramadheer Singh is terrific, his expressions too good.\n\nApart from this, the movie is informative - it very subtly tells the audience all about the way Indian coal mafia has progressed over the years, the gang wars, the politics. Obviously there is a lot of slang. I have not seen a Hindi movie with so crude a language ever, absolutely not recommended for family viewing and children/teenagers.\n\nThe camera angles, especially the final sequence is superb."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Gang of Wasseypur\" (2012) is regarded by many from the Bollywood film tradition as one of the best films ever made. But for a Western audience and standpoint, the film is simply horrible and atrocious. The only fleeting qualities seem to be its obvious production value, coming-of-age idea, and execution in a few actors' performances.\n\nMoreover, the film is brutally sexually and violently perverted to such a severe extent that even the songs in the film are horrifically explicit, particularly in the first half of the film. As this is a crime film, one should expect both plenty of violence and harsh use of language. But this is just plain unnecessary to the point of embarrassment.\n\nJust like this is true of so many other \"heralded masterpieces\" from Bollywood such as \"Airlift\" (2016) and Drishyam (2013), the atrocious nature of the film is that its characters possess no sense of humanity; they are simply stripped of any form of empathy, charm or overall character. In addition to that, the film is horribly edited, wasting more than 5 hours of the viewer's life. The editing is plainly inefficient, random and even unprofessional at times.\n\nAs I am experiencing seeing increasing numbers of heralded Bollywood masterpieces, only to find them to be disastrous by Western standards, I must admit to find this form of \"film making\" quite pathetic for non-domestic audiences. With few exceptions, I seem to find most Bollywood films both embarrassing and atrocious."

        "review_detailed_main": "Recently watched these movie on DVD & not disappointed at all. Just cursing myself , why I didn't watch it on Big Screen ? How Could I missed it? These is the story of Sardar Khan & his sons, their revenge. These movie is made into two parts & both the parts are equally good but still I would like to give extra marks to second part because of one actor Navazuddin Siddique, What an actor these guy is!\n\nThese story revolves around small village in Bihar name Wassypur where main business of people is to work in coal mines or do coal trading. The first part start with gunfire in the house where in the background the music of famous tele serial 'kyoki Sas bhi kabhi bahu thi' is playing, Which is totally unique for any bollywood movie. Then starts the story of Sardar Khan in the flashback. This role is very well played by Manoj bajpai, one of the jewel in bollywood. How Sardar khan become the local don from ordinary coal worker. His tussle with Tigamnsu Dhulia to take the charge of local town. His relation with his wife then his affair with another girl who later become his second wife. These all stories of him captured well by director. the language used in the movie is very authentic which speaks locally in the area of wassypur.\n\nAnother interesting part in the movie is love story between of Nawazuddin & Huma Qureshi which I loved the most. you should watch the scene where Huma Qureshi goes to meet him in jail. All the character in the movie is so important that you can't think any others actors in that roles. To name a few are Rajkumar Rao, Richa Chadda, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Reema Sen, Vineetkumar Singh.\n\nAnurag Kashyap is one of my favorite director he either makes a best movie or worst movie so these is one of the best movie. Don't miss it..."

Really some person could feel that we all are over-hyped that movie, but when you love main-stream cinema and also love to see actors like Manoj Bajpayee, Irrfan Khan, Naseeruddin Shah and Nana Patekar on Big screen and then you got a movie like this, then really you will over shout for that review. Even I could say that its my first review on IMDb and I just got time for writing a review just because of madness GANGS OF WASSEYPUR created over me. And just to give some revert to brilliancy of Mr. Manoj Bajpayee created over the scree. Thank You Sir, for making my day. Go fir it otherwise you will miss something for sure. Thanks Nishant Gupta"

        "review_detailed_main": "GOW is one of the most standout Hindi movies of 2012 directed by Anurag Kashyup. The five hour long movie was released in two parts and every moment of the movie is worth watching. Pepped up with experimental music and quirky dialogues the movie is jam-packed with brilliant but not so mainstream actors. The movie is set in the Dhanbad's Wasseypur, a place rich of black diamond and plagued with rivalry between two Muslim operated gangs stretched across generations. The move beautifully captures the mafia-politician-police nexus in then Bihar, the Bollywood loving junta of Wasseypur and is loaded with songs that you will keep on humming for days. While Manoj Vajpayee's awe will keep you glued to the screen it is Nawazuddin Siddiqui who leapt across the heaven for me. The characters in the film are complex and well-developed and have nothing in common except narcissism and disregard for law. Cinematography is absolutely brilliant and the shot where the coal dust is all that is in the air you will feel as if you are sniffing it under your nostrils. When Jean-Luc Godard said that all you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun, he was probably not wrong; the movie is full of desi guns and village belles where shootouts take place at every nook and corner of the town. The screenplay is steady and doesn't break the environment it creates from the starting. This is a tale of revenge, blood-money and insanity which will leave a spot on your brain for the years to come."

On to the review then; There are two different dubs for this film in English, the initial one i watched on VHS is much better then the one on DVD. The voices match the characters and bring across emotions very well in the VHS dub. In the DVD dub the voices seem alien to the characters personalities, this may be due to the fact that I'm used to seeing the film with the old dub."

This movie has its own sense of comedy, drama, violence and it wont disappoint you. Dialogues as well as music is there to support the screenplay and no more. Direction is articulate and has its own baritone. Divulging parts of stories to justify my points will just be wrong.

Acting by all especially Nawaz and Manoj is great but the latter was much better in Satya...Manoj's best film and performance would always be in Satya and no takeaway in case of this flick...Direction and dialogues are soul of the film...The accent and brutality shown is so real that there is no flaw in this aspect at all...Overall, I went gaga over this film when I watched it for the first time and had not seen Satya... Still would say a superb movie which is different from the regular cinema that Bollywood churns our everyday...Highly Recommended!!"

After seeing this I thought that where the today's Bollywood actors stand in front of the actors of this movie. Expressions of the actors and effects used are very realistic. Also this movie tells a very long story and thus entertains more than other movies. Many actors of the movie are seeing for the first time on a major film but have done a job far better than today's actors. This is real cinema. I do not like today's Bollywood films but this movie has blown my mind. This is the Indian cinema at its best. Crude language and expressions are used at the right time and complete the character the actor is trying to portray. This should be nominated for the Oscar. Not suitable for children and family viewing but is highly recommended for everyone else."

        "review_detailed_main": "Anurag Kashyap has done it once again. For those, who thought \"DevD\" was worthy of the TOI rating of 5/5. GOW deserves a rating of 100/100. A movie can't be bigger than this, bigger not in terms of budget, but in terms of ambitions. I was completely blown away by this epic saga and have ran out of vocabulary when it comes to praise this movie.\n\nThe story starts with a bang. Indian villages of British era were never so authentic since the last time they were shown in Gandhi(1982). Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat) sets the pace of a gory battle that will eventually be continued till the next 60 years. Ramadhir Singh(Tigmanshu Dhulia) gets every nuances rights of his character of a Bhumihar landlord. There is not much story, to be honest, but it's the screenplay that overpowers everything, it gives us characters that will etched in one's memory days after leaving the theater. The sets, locations, dialect, accent literally takes you to Bihar. Whether it's 1941's Bengal or 2004's Jharkhand, the essence of the movie remains hardcore Bihari. However, this isn't completely a grim movie about the then prevalent anarchy in the state. The movie also showers us with some colorful characteristic of the state, such as, Mithun worshiping or the innocent love affairs(Danish's love at first sight and Faisal's interactions with Mohsina). The way they looked into each other's eyes with \"salaam- e-ishq\" playing in background to the way entire scene at the pond when he touches her hand are a delight to watch. Nawazuddin Siddiqui shines in his short role though it is evident he is going to be at center-stage in part II. There are numerous sequences that will remains etched in your memory for a long time, especially most of the scenes with Richa Chadhha(playing Bajpai's wife).Reema Sen showed village sensuality in a way never seen before.\n\nThe music of this movie is strange, as it not exactly a bollywood music, which allows people to go to bathroom or to go for a smoke. Here each song is an integral part of the movie. All songs are short and takes the story forward. However the best part of the music was the use of old songs in the narrative, e.g., \"Kasam paida karne wale ki\" title song. You have to watch it to believe it the way it was shown in the film.\n\nThere is no point writing the story here as this is not a story driven movie, This is a character driven movie and characters with powerful actors. Kahsyap has calculative selected his cast as every actor has given a marvelous performance. However I felt bad for Yashpal Sharma, he should have been given a proper character and now let's talk about the Amitabh of this Trishul, even though Waheeeda, Sanjeev, Shashi and Hema played such beautiful characters, the film would have been nothing sans Bachchan. Same goes for Amitabh of this movie, Manoj Bajpai. I have no adjectives to describe his performance. His role was the strongest and he didn't let his director down but then, he always have been a terrific actor, it's the directors who fail to give him a strong role. I still remember his \"maa'm, maa'm\" from \"Kaun\", which I think one of his most underrated performances. The way he has been shown in the climax will give goosebumps to every person sitting in the theater, the song \"Jiya ho bihar ke lala\" comes at this juncture and it is one of the finest climaxes ever in the history of Indian cinema. Overall, GOW is a movie so damn brilliant, it needs to be seen in order to be believed."

Music will be a exception here the work of Sneha Khanwalkar is truly exceptional.\n\nThis movie should be considered as a milestone in Indian cinema, as well as in Anurag Carrier. From here Anurag will always struggle to meets this standard in future. Talent and effort of many actors like Richa Chadda,Pankaj Tripathi, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Jaideep Ahlawat is payed off in this movie.\n\nA huge expectation is build for the second part, looking forward to watch the character of Piyush Mishra, Timangshu, Nawazuddin in it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gangs of Wasseypur: Spread across 6 decades, 'Gangs of Wasseypur' (GOW) is a revenge saga narrated as raw as possible with violence, gore, filthy dialogs. So are my readers already wondering why I would give it 5 on 5? As a movie lover, the reason is that, it is indeed raw, on-your-face, violent, gory and laden with filth and betrayal. How else is a Mafia-revenge saga supposed to be? To have attempted to make a movie with such a subject is worth praise, and to have made it in a way that the Tarantinos of the world will get a run for their money is another thing all together. GOW premiered in the Director's fortnight at Cannes this year and the movie is a proof that Indian cinema is not just running around the trees and the 'Khan's, Kapoor's and Kleavage'. The movie starts in the current era and takes us 60 years back to the British era, where the Coal mafia is born and sets the background for the movie. Money, Power and Sex are three vices which have always existed, and the characters in the movie are driven by these. Born of these vices are corruption, greed, lust and revenge. The movie showcases the birth of Coal mafia in pre-Independence and its growth post Independence, Scrap trade, trade unions in the free India and how the hunger for Power and Money has corroded our society. The story of Wasseypur is not a far reality from the rest of the country. The characters of the movie are etched to perfection, be it the men in the movie - Sultana Daku, Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat), Ramadhir Singh(Tigmanshu Dhulia), Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai), Faizal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) or the women - Najma (Richa Chadda) and Durga (Reemma Sen). They are not graceful and their tongue is laden with filth. But what else is expected out of a society of people who live in blood and gore! Hats off to all these actors to have pulled of their roles to such perfection. When you see the movie you see Sardar Khan and not Manoj Bajpai, which is a great achievement since he is the only most familiar face of Bollywood in the movie. It surprised me to see his washboard abs, which otherwise is such a selling point for our Khans and Kapoors, was never mentioned in the promos of the movie. The dialogs and the background score of the movie just enhances the movie watching experience. Some of my favourites were mouthed by Najma, Sultan and Sardar Khan. The scene which cuts into India's Independence is one of my favourites in the movie (Won't say what it is here, pls watch the movie to experience it for yourself). Sneha Khanwalkar's music just blends with the movie like salt in water. My favourite tracks are 'Hunter', 'Womeniya' and 'Bihar ke lala'. The surprise package of the movie was Tigmanshu Dhulia, who has given us movies like 'Haasil', 'Sahib, Biwi aur Gangstar' and 'Paan Singh Tomar', showcasing his acting talent. His look is menacing and the scene where he beats up his son is so believable. I am sure more movies are going to be coming his way and would love to see more of such thrilling performances from him. And lastly what can I say which is already not being said about Anurag Kashyap - The Man who had the guts to show us that Devdas, Paro and Chandramukhi were all driven by lust! He indeed is a gifted director who has the vision to put on screen, what I call the 'celebration of Revenge' in Indian cinema in a never-seen-before way. Take a bow Anurag, 'Kasam Paida karne wale ki', you are making Indian Cinema and movie lovers like me swell in pride."

I hardly doubt anyone other than Anurag Kashyap can pull off such a remarkable gangster story spanning generations across 3 families!! Absolutely brilliant film thats worth watching!!"

The script is intricately woven (with no bizarre unbelievable twists we frequently see in our movies). The acting is top-notch. The cinematography, costumes, ambience, vision, presentation, conviction are all right up there. Every scene, every emotion is well thought out. The character development is fabulous, although you don't see every character's reaction to every event, when you see the character next you can clearly see how she/he has evolved through the preceding events. What marvelous scripting and editing.\n\nThe music, oh my god, it grows on you. It is an acquired taste, but once it engulfs you, you are trapped for good.\n\nThis movie has so much depth, I've watched it multiple times. And still each time I watch it again, I find something new to admire and enjoy. A big thank you to all those who stayed committed to make it. It's a lifetime treasure.\n\nIf you've seen this movie, watch it again, today, or on the weekend, both parts end-to-end. You'll definitely have a good time. Now I'll go cherish the final sequence again."

He has done full justice to his role, his character is dark and devious, at the same time he's romantic and funny, Nawazuddin plays it perfectly.\n\nPiyush Mishra is superb in both the parts.\n\nTigmanshu Dhulia (Ramadhir Singh) is marvelous, I didn't even realise that it's his debut film.\n\nRicha Chadda was fab in part one but doesn't have much to do in part two.\n\nReemma Sen and Huma Qureshi have done a nice job.\n\nZeishan Quadri (Definite) has played his role very nicely.\n\nAditya Kumar (Perpendicular) is superb.\n\nJaideep Ahlawat (Shahid Khan) in part one had done a very nice work.\n\nPankaj Tripathi, Raj Kumar Yadav, Vineet Kumar, Satya Anand, Vipin Sharma and Anurita Jha have played their roles perfectly.\n\nPart one gives some very nice comic relief, Part two also has many 'lol' scenes. Actually I haven't laughed so much even in comedy movies of recent times.\n\nAnurag Kashyap proves that he's an outstanding director. He should definitely get opportunities to make big budget films.\n\nThe sound is awesome and the music is superb especially in part one, Hunter, Bihar Ke Lala, O Womaniya & Tain Tain To To are my favorites from part one and Chhi Cha Ledar, Kala Rey & Electric Piya from part two.\n\nI'll rate it 9/10.

A story which is said to be 80% real and 20% fiction, traces the Wasseypur mafia from pre-independence days, particularly focuses on one lineage which is at war with the established mafia of the town and jostles for supremacy. Other than Manoj Bajpai in first part and Nawaz in the second, particularly impressive were Richa Chadda as the gangster wife Nagma, the scene where she drives away the police searching for jail-breaking Sardar Khan with pitch perfect accent and aggression, debudant Tigmangshu Dhulia as the politiican Ramadhir Singh was cool and 'Definite' Zeishan Kadri is strikingly . The desi-bidesi tunes, moments of confusion and dialogues put in ample doses of humour amongst the blood, gore, deceit and ruthlessness of the gun wielding gangs. Use of the Godfather tune was also notable akin to the plot's resemblance with the iconic film. Nawaz plays a waiter when Manoj Vajpeyee was the main man in Shool and 13 years later he got to play his son and the lead in Part 2, just goes to show the struggle one has to go through on way up if from outside Bolly families. Anurag Kashyap's magnum opus rightfully made its way straight into IMDB Top 250. 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gangs of Wasseypur is a 2012 Hindi crime movie directed and co- written by Indian movie-maker Anurag Kashyap starring veteran Indian actor Manoj Bajpai in the lead role. Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur is a crime saga that revolves around a three-generation long sanguinary rivalry between two disputing Muslim clans: the 'Khans' and the 'Qureshis'. However, this bloody battle is not religious but strictly territorial in nature as the two clans indulge in incessant fights seeking carte blanche to run their respective crime syndicates in Wasseypur. It's worth mentioning that the events and circumstances depicted in Gangs of Wasseypur are fictionalized accounts of the real life events that occurred in the district of Wasseypur during the pre and post-independence India.\n\nDespite a taut narrative, Gangs of Wasseypur occasionally suffers from redundancy in its plot that often reflects in its expletive-driven, harangue-like dialogue. Another thing that can be disconcerting to a seasoned movie viewer is Gangs of Wasseypur's obvious similarity to Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather Trilogy. Now, as much as it may sound like a disparaging remark for Gangs of Wasseypur, in reality it's a testament to the timelessness and universality of Coppola's masterful crime saga that continues to inspire movie-makers worldwide even after so many decades. Anurag Kashyap has indeed succeeded in leaving a mark with his rustic adaptation.\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is that the name 'Gangs of Wasseypur' bears a striking similarity to Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York. The similarity is obviously not limited to the name, for the battle scenes filmed in Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur match and at times surpass the gore and grotesquery depicted in Scorsese's larger than life portrayal of gang wars in the nineteenth century New York City. In Gangs of Wasseypur, Kashyap strives to strike the right balance between various cinematic elements that helps the movie touch the lows and highs of cinema, thereby helping it break the stereotype associated with quintessential Bollywood cinema. Gangs of Wasseypur serves to be a highlight-reel of some of the most disturbing sequences ever filmed in Indian cinema depicting shootouts, prison-breaks, brawls, bomb blasts, rallies, kidnappings, rapes, train-robberies, forced marriages, women in labor, lovemaking, killings, and butchery. One interesting facet that makes these scenes really effective is the level of realism and conviction with which they are carried forward in the movie.\n\nIn Gangs of Wasseypur, Anurag Kashyap presents a grim picture of human decadence: Amongst the hundreds of masculine characters depicted in the movie, one doesn't get to witness a single likable character, for most of them come across as bestial beings desperate to serve their basic instincts of survival, physical love, wealth and power. On the other hand, the women are portrayed as secondary beings who are looked upon by men as materialistic pleasures rather than meaningful pursuits. Manoj Bajpai delivers a tour de force in Gangs of Wasseypur. His portrayal of Sardar Khan ranks right up there with the very best performances in the history of Indian cinema. Sardar is ferocious killer as well as a voracious lover whose feral instincts to kill (his adversaries) are remarkably matched by his play boyish passion to for physical love. It is this balance that helps him keep his composure amidst pervasive insanity and gives him the courage to single- handedly knockout his adversaries. Sardar Khan uses a combination of brute force and acumen to rise to the top of the food chain. Manoj Bajpai musters all his talent and courage to perfectly fit into the shoes of Sardar Khan. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that no other actor could have fit better in the role of a 'Desi Bahubali' than Bajpai himself.\n\nThe rest of the cast gives memorable performances that help bring characters to life with a special mention of Nawazuddin Siddiqui whose underplayed cameo as Sardar Khan's younger son offered a great contrast to Manoj Bajpai's over the top portrayal. Siddiqui's low-key portrayal is also in great contrast to his portrayal of a tough, haughty cop in Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani. It's remarkable that in such a shot period of time he has shown such great versatility as an actor. Siddiqui is expected to have a major role in the second part of Gangs of Wasseypur considering the similarities of his part to Al Pacino's Michael Corleone. Whether Siddiqui will succeed in carving a niche for himself as Pacino had managed with his portrayal in The Godfather I & II is for the time to decide. The cinematography of Gangs of Wasseypur is at par with the best in the world. Kashyap's sense of timing with the use of music is also exemplary. Kashyap expertly introduces occasional bursts of music and comedy to punctuate the slowly augmenting tension tension at different junctures in the movie. Kashyap's use of dark humor to judiciously propagate violence has an uncanny similarity to Quentin Tarantino's style of filmmaking. His choice of music in the movie's final sequence that depicts the brutal killing of one of movie's major characters is bizarre yet remarkably effective.\n\nOverall, Gangs of Wasseypur serves to be a unique cinematic experience that's not free of its flaws. However, despite its apparent flaws, Gangs of Wasseypur has enough to offer to a keen movie-viewer who would not allow him/her to be overwhelmed by movie's abundance of everything. Gangs of Wasseypur serves be a sanguinary carnival of epic proportions that's surely not meant for the faint-hearted. The movie is an essential viewing for the lovers of Indian cinema, for they will get to see something quite refreshing in Gangs of Wasseypur, and also for those who want to get acquainted with it.\n\n(This review was first published at A Potpourri of Vestiges)"

While the action, drama, and direction is top notch in this movie, the story is fake, and is just the opposite as to what is shown in the movie. The antagonist in movie in real life is the the hero of Dhnabad. There is even a statue of him in Jharia, and protagonist (Shafiq Khan) is actually the villain, who is serving his life term in Hazaribaug Jail.

The swear words are like the actor is himself given the right to add ON_SPOT swears. The story up till 4th generation embedding in just 2.5 hours is actually a achievement in itself. Tigmanshu Dhulia proves that good directors can also be excellent actors. The movie is actually a 5 hour 40 minutes and if it would have been released in one shot,it would have definitely grabbed my attention for sure. Work of both the actresses is outstanding.The sexual crave is given a hidden shadow over violence and betrayal of husband. The whole 1900 period atmosphere is perfectly captured with rustic style of clothes and scenario. The start of the movie is a perfect sarcasm depicting a 2000 based serial into 1800 era show.The famous Indian daily soap build a curious mood and the next immediate scene has a gunshot into the TV.Outstanding direction.The young actors have also done an appreciable work and the part 2 would be equipped with a lot of modern weapons i guess. Cannot wait more for release of Part- 2. Do watch. 9/10 (Just because profit was given more preference than releasing the whole movie"

        "review_detailed_main": "Gangs of wasseypur is a 5 hours long film which is divided in to two parts and to be honest it never felt like it was overlong or unnecessary, Gangs of wasseypur is one of those few films that takes Indian cinema to the international level. There is a lot of influence from other classics which made Gangs of wasseypur a great film, like the influence of Scorsese's style of direction or Tarantino's way of showing minute communication between two characters or the idea of \"no one wins\" might be inspired from 'The Departed'. Films like Goodfellas may have some influence over it but still I think Gangs of wasseypur has done many things better than Goodfellas, the potray of violence with calm music and great acting is done better here, the depiction of the city and buildup is better than most of the films. And most importantly the 5 hours long runtime makes it more versatile towards character development, these great things are very much rare to find in most of the films, only a single film comes to my mind which surpassed it is a Brazilian film City of god and its obvious because the idea of making Gangs of wasseypur came from the film City of god which is in itself a great film. Talking about the acting, its outstanding, probably the best casting possible with great actors like Manoj Bajpayee, Pankaj Tripathy, nawazuddin siddiqui to name a few, the way they acted with great expressions, great delivery of dialogues and body language is unmatched till now. Its one the fewest films where you can sense the real feeling of the city, everything feels real and groundbreaking in every aspect. So finally I conclude myself and its offcourse highly recommended.\n\nMy Ratings - 9.8/10."

Definitely the best movie of Indian cinema. Manoj Vajpai should definitely get the best actors award for this movie. This movie show that you don't need celebrities/Superstars to compose a hit movie but you need great actors to make it a success. This movie underlines the fact that there is no shortage of acting talent in India but their utilization and appreciation is required."

It's one long movie split in two.\n\nAt that length one could imagine it's way too long and the story stretches itself thin. I'd argue that it's actually not long enough and should be a series. When you cram 7 generations into 5 hours it's not hard to see why everything gets glossed over. The movie should either have been short and more focused on one story, or long and be released as a series.\n\nThere's one scene in the film where a guard is killed, completely silent I might add, by putting a towel over his head, seemingly suffocating him.\n\nThat scene describes the whole film as that's about how much thought went into every character, every plot and every subplot it has.\n\nCharacters and plots points never get explored, fleshed out or any kind of 2nd dimension to them. Most of the dozens of characters are only there to be on screen, never have any use and then be disposed of anyway.\n\nCrime empires are built in minutes (with only two or three henchmen) and crumble down in even less time.\n\nNothing in this film, nothing at all, has any significance or carries any weight whatsoever. I can't find a single saving grace to any of it."

No exotic locations, no overtly or skimpily dressed stars, no so called \"superstars\", this movie is a sure treat to watch i.e. of course of your above 18. We Indians and of course the stars should come out of their mindsets of making \"blockbusters\" which in most cases make least or no sense to the viewers.

And this movie perfectly touches those spots. Acting, direction, screenplay, background score, dialogues everything feels raw and real. 5 hours of runtime would pass like nothing the film's gonna keep you hooked up till the very \"BLOODY\" end.

An entire life can be extrapolated from almost every character who appears over the course of the film, and several of them could easily have entire movies in which their storyline is the center. Yet at no point is there an issue of diffuse focus, or of misplaced importance. The performances, across the board, are magnificent, with special credit to be paid to Khan family matriarch Richa Chaddha, and her second son (and star of the second part of the film) played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, whose work and character arc in \"Gangs of Wasseypur\" defy superlative. Everything is exactly as it should be, storywise, and the total is an astonishing feat, worthy of discussion alongside Coppola's first two \"Godfather\" films, or Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in America.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Having grown up watching Bollywood my entire life, I always thought that the films in the genre had a basic methodology to them. I really enjoyed the cycles of marriage, dancing, singing and heartbreak, but ultimately, found the films very formulaic. Don't get me wrong - I love Bollywood, and certain iterations of those movies can really knock it out of the park (ie, Munna Bhai MBBS, PK, Taare Zameen Par, etc.), but after seeing so much of the same stuff, I really felt there had been a limit to what South Asian films can offer. Gangs of Wasseypur completely turns that notion on its head and helped expose me to what Indian cinema can really be.\n\nGangs of Wasseypur takes the viewer on a generation-spanning saga of a broken crime family in the Dhanbad, East India. The film specifically follows the life and children of Sardar Khan, a Robin Hood-type character whose journey only leads to violence and regret for those he associates himself with. The most triumphant aspect of this film must be the direction. The use of music, pacing, and editing provides for a non-stop experience that keeps the viewer glued to the screen at all times. For a running time of around five hours, Gangs of Wasseypur, even when the two parts combine together, feels like it could be much longer. It whips through its action and suspense with such fervor that the audience barely gets the chance to catch its breath before the next one. Aside from the sometimes scattered script and unclear character motivations, Gangs of Wasseypur needs to be viewed by any fan of excellent storytelling."

        "review_detailed_main": "This review might be biased because I am a great fan of Anurag Kashyap's movies. Having said that, I do not think people would disagree with the admiration shown. Gangs of Wasseypur is Kashyap's take on Indian godfather. If you are an international at heart, you need to know the local nuances to understand the comic timing, the intensity, the issues, the reactions of characters. However, even an unfamiliar would be taken through the streets of Wasseypur really smoothly.\n\nSardar Khan essayed by Manoj Bajpayee, and his wife Richa Chaddha have played their part nicely. From setting up of his empire around Wasseypur to expanding his business and later on transferring the legacy to his sons, Bajpayee has eased into the character.\n\nThere is no typical bollywood masala dance numbers, yet the background scores are simply apt for the story. The real plus about this movie is the way the characters get developed and mature over the course of the movie. That is something which people rarely notice yet decides the pace and the coherence of the movie.\n\nThis movie is certainly one to watch, and will invariably lead one into the next part. Both the movies offer 6 hour of serious entertainment and a crash course into the old mafia raj of pre 1990 India.\n\nI rate this movie 8 out of 10 for the aforementioned credits."

        "review_detailed_main": "Animosity is a great equalizer; the feeling doesn't discriminate between caste, religion or economic background. Two enemies are men on a mission and anything or anyone else in their way is collateral damage.\n\n\"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer\", Sardar Khan (played by Manoj Bajpai) lives by this philosophy seeking revenge from his closest enemy Ramadhir Singh (played by Tigmanshu Dhulia), a vicious politician and chief of a large coal mafia based in the coal capital of India, Dhanbad. The movie starts with the elimination of Faisal Khan and his family in 2004 and backtracks to 1941 Wasseypur. The animosity between Sardar Khan and Ramadhir Singh dates back to the 1950's when Shahid Khan, Sardar Khan's father, who works for the coal mafia leader Ramadhir Singh is killed by him. Sardar Khan then vows not give his arch enemy an easy death but finish his strength and then his life gradually. \"Teri Keh ke Loonga\" is how he proclaims he will seek his revenge \u2013 To screw his life like man from the front and not stab him in the back like a coward.\n\nThe rest of the movie revolves around both minor and major encounters between the two protagonists. The confrontations are both sinister and hilarious between these equally dangerous men. Anurag Kashyap has brilliantly delivered these difficult scenes with utmost simplicity that sometimes you can miss the subtle hints. Songs are well placed and in the background, Hunter & Womaniya are my personal favourites. The swearing and cuss words are never out of place and go with the local lingo.\n\nThis is out & out a Manoj Bajpai movie; he is brilliant in simple scenes, from fighting and killing a muscleman in the middle of a market, to where he seduces his second wife Reema Sen while she is washing clothes. He is playful and sinister at the same time. Tigmanshu Dhulia (well known as director of the recent hit Paan Singh Tomar) as the coal mafia leader delivers an impactful performance with minimum dialogues and maximum expressions. The surprise package in this one is Richa Chadda, (Dolly from Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye), playing the character of Manoj Bajpai's first wife is as naughty and as mysterious as her husband's character, at times swearing more than him. The supporting cast is brilliant and every character is a natural from the train driver in 1941 to the silent assassin, Yadavjee, who keeps making his appearance at important junctures in the movie. The man to look out for in Gangs of Wasseypur 2 is Nawazuddin Siddiqui (the no nonsense intelligence officer Khan in Kahaani), playing the role of Sardar Khan's younger son Faisal khan leaves a mark albeit a brief role in this part. Yashpal Sharma does an unforgettable cameo as an item boy on the yesteryears song Salam-e-Isq from Muqaddar ka Sikander.\n\nI had been waiting to watch this movie after such rave reviews and finally got a chance to see it last night. Watching a movie with such high expectations a lot of times backfires like the country-made revolvers which are used by the gangsters and as they say in the movie \"Katte ka pipe fat ke flower ho jaata hai\". But this one was like a slow poison, gradually making its impact as it starts and so subtle that by the time you realize you are totally hooked on and attached to the characters. The climax leaves you hungry for more and I am desperate for the second part to be released.\n\nA secret: Don't walk out of the cinema hall when the credits are rolling. If you are patient and stay till the end, you will be treated to the trailer of Gangs of Wasseypur 2."

        "review_detailed_main": "In an era where mediocrity is sold in the name of entertainment and an average cine-goer is relentlessly served mindless blockbusters, Gangs of Wasseypur is leaps and bounds ahead of its times be it in terms of direction, screenplay, performances or dialogues.\n\nAnurag Kashyap once again stands out with this hard-hitting yet entertaining masterpiece, reaffirming his reputation and this one, in fact, catapults him into another league altogether. He can easily be termed, dare I say, Tarantino of Hindi Cinema. There have been countless movies in world cinema in general, and Bollywood in particular, based on the themes of revenge spanned across generations and gory tales of mining mafia but the panache with which film has been directed means that the viewer is never allowed a loo break. The premise of the movie is violent but it has its share of light moments that perfectly punctuate it without diluting the mood.\n\nThough every one has pitched in with enthralling performances, I was particularly impressed with Manoj Bajpayi portraying Sardar Khan, Tigmanshu Dhulia portraying Ramadhir Singh and Richa Chadda playing the wife of Sardar Khan. The dialogues are superbly penned and hailing from the heartland where the film is based, I was amazed by the details of mannerisms (or ill-mannerisms) and accent perfectly depicted in the movie.\n\nThe background score is riveting and perfectly timed and so are the songs and music. Kudos to Sneha Kalwalkar for bringing out the folklore of Bihar so magnificently.\n\nIf there is anything about the movie that I would change, it would be its length. The run time could have been shorter with a little bit of editing but even with this length, the film does not let your mind wander.\n\nLooking forward to the second part for an epic finale. The trailer at the end of credits sure promises it to be one."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is hands-down one of the best movies of the decade, not just from Indian cinema, but from all over the world. IMDb has merged it into one, but it's actually a 2 part saga of crime, loyalty, family, relationships and most importantly revenge.\n\nThe story is stretched across three generations and starts with a disagreement between the Pahtan's and Qureshi's. Both these sects of Wasseypur already had a tough disagreements in the past, but Shahid Khan, a Pathan, masquerading himself as a Qureshi bandit boils the tension to a whole new level and Shahid Khan is forced to leave Wasseypur. Shahid moves to Dhanbad, where he meets a coal mine owner called Ramadhir Singh. Shahid plans to move up the ladder by killing Ramadhir Singh and taking his place, but to his surprise Ramadhir gets to know about this and haves him murdered.\n\nWhat begins is a vicious tale of revenge that leads to three generations of hatred and violence.\n\nThere have been revenge movies before, but the one that can come close to GOW is Kill Bill. I can't decide which one is better at this point, but much like GOW it was 2-part revenge story where the motive was to eliminate one person.\n\nActing in the movie was flawless all around. Manoj Bajpayee was perhaps the one who was the most interesting. However, Nawazudding Siddiqqui, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Richa Chadda and so many other actors give spectacular performances.\n\nAnurag Kashyap was able to deliver such a brilliant film, and I feel this movie still hasn't receive the recognition it deserves.\n\nDon't ignore this masterpiece just because it comes from an Industry notorious for creating happy-go-lucky dance sequences. It's not a film for the fainthearted, but this new generation of cinema from Bollywood needs to be appreciated."

        "review_detailed_main": ". The movie travels you back to the time as even the details of the way houses and gullies used to be at that time looks of that era. The film takes time to pick up the pace initially especially till the time the central character of Sardar Khan played by talented Manoj Bajpayee enters . He doesn't shine as the hero of the movie but he is an ordinary man with enough guts to take up the mighty dhoti clad politician cum businessman Ramadhar Singh played by the ace director Tigmanshu Dhulia. The initial 30-45 minutes are more about building the plot of the story than jumping directly into the theme. The son revenge over his father death is never a revelation in the bollywood mainstream but the tight script laden with many one liners which make you feel that this movie is so close to reality and thats where the film scores an advantage. The chemistry between Sardar Khan and his wife Nagma, played by the tall Punjabi girl from Delhi, Richa Chaddha is blunt. They love , they hate , they abuse and they need each other. Thats the reality of many young couples in everyday life, isn't it. The film makes you think hard on drawing the line of morality as every character in the movie has shades of Grey. Whether its the another dominant Muslim faction of the butchers , or the Khan clan of Sardar Khan or the corrupt politician, they all are opportunistic and are hungry to reign their supremacy. The film literally travels with time and Sardar Khan moves from Dhanbad to Wasseypur , a small town near the coal district and forms his mighty gang which is more powerful than the butchers and the politician. The violence strikes many times but it never makes you close your eyes , instead it makes you think that many bloodbaths happen with a cool and calm mind and not in fit or anger. Sardar Khan's character is serious about the revenge of his father's murder but is also equally serious about his mistress played by the Bengali beauty Reema Sen. One is left hard to understand if Sardar Khan is using the lady to satisfy his lust or the lady is using him to satisfy her lust and greed. Nagma, played by Richa Chaddha is a strong and outspoken women who doesn't bow to go against her husband even when her husband doesn't live with her anymore. Howver , at the same time she doesn't spare him either and hurls abuses at him on his greed for sex and womanizing. The film binds the audience with fast storytelling in the middle and doesn't give time to predict the next scenes. One style of filmmaking is that never give enough time to audience to think what will come next and you have won the hearts of the audience. The two young sons of Sardar Khan are like poles apart in their living but the traces of their father's mentality is preserved. While one is more crazy , smoking cigarettes and pots ; the other is slightly peace maker who proposes to marry the girl from the leader of the butcher family in order to get united. The script is good , the dialogs are sharp , story telling is structured , movement is fast , songs and lyrics are unorthodox of any typical bollywood film but what works the most in the movie is the characters. All the songs have become a rage whether its Hunter, womaniya or jiya ho Bihar ke lala. In fact , I have heard these songs as caller tunes of many people whom I call, which reflects the mass acceptance of the songs with a difference. The characters, I would say are the heart of the movie; whether its a cameo by the guy who dances on the old Hindi movie hit \"Kasam paida Karney wale Ki\" , the guy who is singing \"salame ishe meri jaan\" in both the male and female voice during the Nikah of Sardar Khan's son or the Ray Ban girl who preaches in chaste bihari accent to Sardar Khan's son to catch hold of a girl's hand only after taking her permission. The lead actress or the \"Womaniya\" of the film played by Richa Chaddha ( if you remember , she played the role of a spoiled girl who is after Abhay Deol in Oye Lucky Lucky Oye) is terrific as Nagma . Its not easy to fit under a role of a woman which demands boldness not in terms of skin exposure but in terms of the skin of the character and she has done it a perfect 10. Piyush Mishra always comes good and here is no exception. Nawazuddin Shaikh who plays as one of the son of Sardar Khan is also good and the in the next part \"Gangs of Wasseypur II\" he will be seen in a more crazy character. Not to forget to mention the last scene of the movie, where Sardar Khan is attacked by his enemies in his car. I don't want to mention any spoiler hence would not go beyond this on the film's story line. The movie is simply binding,amazing as the violence and murder makes you not only shiver but also laugh at times. The characters act violently as if its like any other daily work for them. The movie is inspired by bits and pieces of some real stories from the small place Wasseypur , but still you cant take credit away from a tight script writing. I think that \"Gangs of Wasseypur \" is going to open gates to for many such reality struck movies. we will get to see some really good movies from the talented filmmakers who would define the new \"Gangs of Bollywood\""

What makes this movie a masterpiece ?, everything about it. The characters are so unforgettable, intense and funny at the same time. Anurag Kashyap credits Sasikumar's \"Subramanya Puram\" as his inspiration but for me the obvious inspiration seems to be martin Scorsese's \"gangs of New York\" . Both the names sounds similar, both the story plot are revolving around revenge and both the story lines show the changes that happened in the respective city or places over years of time. Where this movie excels is in its understanding and capturing of the geography, socio political situations and conveying it to the audience so interestingly. From costumes to architecture to songs, the authenticity and aesthetics is undeniable. Bollywood's directors must learn how to use music in movies from this movie. The way the music blends in this scenes is just so amazing, i wonder why Sneha khanwalkar is not making more music in bollywood movies. The performances in this movie is exceptional, Manoj Bajpayee, Himanshu Dhulia, Nawazuddin Siddique, Richa chadda, Vineeth, and everyone gives exceptional and career best performances. I can talk about this movie for hours, but let me just stop here and say, its a masterpiece.\n\n\"gangs of Wasseypur : part two\" another masterpiece.\n\nMany people seems to have a issue in still figuring out which is a better movie, godfather part 1 or part 2. I have a similar situation going on about gangs of Wasseypur part 1 and 2, i cant properly answer which is better. There are few movies that tell stories of such interesting and compelling characters from their birth to death and gives an amazing character study. I cant praise this movie enough and how much i love it. The performances, the songs, the writing, the dialogues, the background music, i like everything about this movie. I personally don't think Anurag Kashyap can make a movie that will surpass this. But i also wish he does something like that and surprise me completely. Nothing much to say, its a masterpiece. Watch it, if you haven't watched it already."

        "review_detailed_main": "Explosive, Rollicking & Hard Hitting ......... are the right adjectives which can be associated after watching Mr. Anurag Kashyap's gun blazing, gob smacking bihari gangster opera named \"Gangs of Wasseypur\". Not many films in bollywood can claim to be real , dark and deep yet entertaining to the core but Gangs of Wasseypur is gonna jolt the viewer from inside with its real and gut wrenching depiction of an infamous land known for its dangerous coal mafia and sinister gang battles. Film sets it up to be fire brand from the very first scene when a gang armed to the teeth with bombs and machine guns blast their way into the palace-fortress of the reigning don, Faizal Khan and from that very first scene film takes the viewer back to pre-independence era where the story actually sets up.\n\nShahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat) is a Pathan who is fond of theatricals and his cunning greed triggers him to loot the British trains in the name of a fallen infamous dacoit Sultana Daku. Shahid Khan is eventually murdered by the young owner of the coal mines, Ramadhir Singh, setting off a power struggle between the two clans that lasts till the final reel. Quentin Tarantino once said in an interview - \"Violence is the purest form of emotion.... it has no moralities or politics attached to it\". Gangs of Wasseypur also pays homage to his lines and turns out to be a blatantly violent film. The reality with which violence has been depicted in the movie makes it a heart pounding and an authentic piece of work. There is never a dull moment in the film as its funny and entertaining to the core some of the scenes are so funny that it will literally delight the viewer.\n\nThe director has to be given full marks for covering a span of 50 years in a single film with very beautifully presenting the changing times by showing the film posters and using old classic songs in the background of scenes and letting the viewer to think and wonder about the time period. Piyush Mishra as Sutradhaar of the film very cleverly narrates the story and changing times. GOW is so smartly paced and articulately presented that even due to its long running time the viewer will be engaged and will be left craving to see more till the last reel.\n\nTalking about the performances, Manoj Bajpayee delivers a winning act as a fiery, dangerous, casanova bihari gangster whose only motive is to avenge his father's death. He has actually elevated the whole movie by leaps and bounds, his performance mesmerizes and delivers shock and delight in equal measures. Richa Chadha is actually a revelation as Sardar Khan's wife, she is actually a fire cracker as Nagma in the film her scenes with Manoj Bajpayee are one of the high points of the film. Piyush Mishra is a treat to watch in a restrained performance as Sardar Khan's uncle.Tigmanshu Dhulia surprises as a corrupt Politician Ramadhir Singh he proves that not only he is an ace director but a fantastic actor also. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is excellent as Faizal Khan , Huma Qureshi is looking very beautiful and is fantastic in one of a scene where she first confronts Faizal Khan for making advances on her and then very sweetly gives in after wards. We will be seeing more of Nawazuddin and Huma in the second part later this year.\n\nMoving onto the technical part, the music of the film is a masterstroke of a soundtrack kudos to Sneha Khanwalkar for making raw, folkish songs interlaced with western beats. Everybody are rooting for Jiya Tu and Hunter Song well yes they both are brilliant tracks but my favorite is Keh Ke Lunga.. this venomous song brilliantly sung by Amit Trivedi and Sneha Khanwalkar sets the mood of the film right from the word go.Womaniya is naughty as hell and talks about the feminine brilliance. Film is very beautifully shot courtesy Rajeev Ravi's consummate camera-work his camera always seems to be in the right spot to capture the action. Dialogues are fire and very desi full of expletives which makes the film very authentic and real. Screenwriters Anurag Kashyap, Zeishan Quadri, Akhilesh Jaiswal and Sachin Ladia has to be given full marks for writing pacy and fantastic screenplay and story. Last but not the least Director Anurag Kashyap's penchant for deep, dark and daring makes this film a class act. He created a brand of its own with real and hard hitting films like Black Friday, Gulaal , No Smoking and Dev D previously but Gangs of Wasseypur actually breaks the convention and clich\u00e9s of Indian cinema and reinvents the mainstream and commercial cinema.\n\nLastly the final thoughts to culminate this review will be that please don't afford to miss this one. This blood feud vendetta saga shocks, entertains and mesmerizes."

Though the movie is a fiction, but the scenes are so real that audience is made to believe that Wasseypur is another name for crime. The adaptation of the language of the region, the attire is presented beautifully. You are so involved in the movie that you curse the director for ending it even after 2 hours and 40 minutes. Though most of the things were taken care of, still there were some plot holes which catch the eye of viewer. Otherwise it is a wonderful entertainer. I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggest great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended."

Brilliant dialogues, delivered with great panache. Another feather in the hat of Anurag Kashyap who has given great movies, such as Paanch, Dev D, Gulal, Black Friday, etc. A really gripping story line, told at a brilliant pace, enough to keep you at the edge of you seat, and also ensuring that you don't either get bored or fall of the edge with excitement. Definitely not a movie to watch with your family if you are conservative. But it is a real entertainer. Hats Off to the entire crew of GoW, and eagerly waiting for release of GoW 2 in India. :)"

As it is based on true story the mindset of the people of wasseypur is very raw. Some parts make you feel how can a person be so ghastly. The epic to show the small time thugs become such a big gangster is unique. My only concern is the movie is too fast, however some wonderful acting and inch perfect detailing stills the show. For me this the best movie of 2012 till date"

This wonderfully crafts out motivations and characteristics of each family member, especially between the sons of Sardar, who will all play pivotal roles in the sequel, since the very first scene here would have shown each of them under different camps, and teasing us with just how allegiances would play out with family members now standing under different banners. Part of the engagement now would be to develop the narrative to reach the inevitable, and with the ensemble set up, the possibilities are endless."

        "review_detailed_main": "The reason why GANGS OF WASSEYPUR will not immediately take its rightful place in the pantheon of Hindi cinema as one of the most daring, visionary, innovative and masterful films that Bollywood has ever produced, is because it is too long (at 2 hours 40 minutes) for kids looking for a fun way to while away a couple of hours, too gory for adults looking for \"wholesome family entertainment\", too complex even for movie critics who have to chew their pens all through the film, struggling to come up with catchy phrases to describe the film with, a film whose plot defies explanation, whose characters defy categorization, a film whose very existence, proves without a doubt, that Anurag Kashyap is not only a genius, but a mad, psychotic genius at that.\n\nGANGS OF WASSEYPUR is Anurag Kashyap's gift to the torrent-crazy cinema buffs of India. This film deserves (and requires) an audience prepared to give it the time and attention it needs, an audience which has gone in for the experience and nothing more, an audience which has gone in without moral inhibitions and an audience which can appreciate Kashyap's shattering of certain cinematic traditions and embracing of others, which makes the film such a delightful watch.\n\nIt would be incongruous, having called the plot too complex to explain, if I tried to do just that (i.e. explain), and indeed the task exceeds my ability. The massive, epic behemoth of a screenplay details the decades-long blood feud between Sardar Singh (Manoj Bajpai) and Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia), making detours into the workings of the coal mafia of Dhanbad, train-robbers, badland politics, romance, seduction and infidelity. These detours have been criticized by many critics, calling it the reason why the film is self-indulgent, overlong and needlessly complex. But it is those little moments, not really important in progressing the plot (and in the hands of a more commercial-minded director, would probably have been snipped) but magical in exposition of character, like a slow-mo dream sequence where two people reciprocate their mutual attraction by putting on matching Ray-Bans, or another scene where Sardar and his mates humiliate Ramadhir and his son in a police station, and then gleefully walk into jail as punishment (which jail they later break out of).\n\nIt has to be admitted, perhaps, that the editing scissors may have been sharpened in some places, but there is not much that can be cut off, which would not decrease the overall impact of the film. The film is a gargantuan experience, an epic in the truest sense of the term, an ambitious chronicle of the dusty hinterland of India over the period of six decades. And what's more, unlike most epics, not for one moment, did I realize how long the film was. It is that rare thing, a gripping epic thriller.\n\nThe acting is spectacularly good, whether it be Richa Chadda as Sardar's long-suffering feisty wife, Reemma Sen as Durga the seductress, Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Sardar's Michael Corleone-esque son, or Piyush Mishra as Sardar's uncle. But the meatiest two roles in the film, played by Bajpai and Dhulia, are transcendent. Dhulia stuns as the powerful mine owner-to-politician, spitting out expletives with a quiet venomous voice, so that waves of hate seem to emanating from the big screen. And what to say about the erstwhile Mumbai ka Don, Bhiku Mhatre? With one of his most powerful roles in recent times, Manoj Bajpai makes every second of his screen time count, running the gamut of emotions with the ease of a maestro, from lust to rage. His eyes say it all.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes departments are phenomenal here. Full marks to Sneha Khanwalkar's exquisite and innovative soundtrack, with songs like Hunter and Keh Ke Lunga (the movie's theme song, so to say), which break every tradition in Bollywood music, and complement the visuals beautifully. The production design by Wasiq Khan is also flawless, capturing the colours and textures of India's Hindi belt from the 1930s to the 80s. The mise en scene is spot on in every frame of the film, from the blood-spattered Kasai mohalla of the Qureshis to the white Ambassador of Ramadhir Singh. Kudos also the exquisite cinematography. Kashyap and his DOP Rajeev Ravi (No Smoking) create a restless roving camera, which swoops up and down and in and out in a delightful array of moves, some of which I have no idea how they did. The opening scene where a house is riddled with bullets and hand grenades, men poking rifles through holes in the doors and firing in every direction, is shocking in the immediacy of the violence. You are not just watching the scene, you are in it.\n\nThe film is filled with cinematic homages from a Disco Dancer-era Mithun impersonator to the last scene of the film, which is uncannily similar to the scene from The Godfather where Sonny Corleone gets assassinated. The shadow of The Godfather looms large over this film, many characters fitting the moulds of Vito Corleone, Tom Hagen or Michael Corleone. There is even a blood-thirsty Virgil Sollozzo-type among the multitude of characters in the film. But unlike Sarkar, GANGS OF WASSEYPUR is not a Godfather remake. This is a film unique to India, a story of an Indian town in the lawless badlands. As a cinematic experience, it stands tall beside Coppola's classic and calls out to be considered an equal.\n\nAt last, we have a Bollywood film (and make no mistake, this is a masala potboiler at its very best), that can flick the best of world cinema in the nuts. Now that is as good a reason to see the film as any. Long live the King of Alternative Bollywood, Anurag Kashyap!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed the movie which takes off a bit like the Doordarshan documentary of the yore which is made tolerable only by the rasping narration of that genius Piyush Mishra. The historical narrative was really unnecessary and could have been dramatically played out in a shorter frame. It not only prolonged the movie but also delayed the development of the main plot, speaking of which I was a tad disappointed. A movie is an audio visual narration of a story. It needs to be different from a television serial. GOW's progress is more of a series of interesting episodes rather than a firm plot. It's another matter that Kashyap has managed to pull it off but at the end of it all one does start wondering about what one has just watched. There is a heavy emphasis on blood and gore and even heavier on profanities under the garb of realism. Oh yes, it had the audience freaking out especially when it's the female character mouthing them. Of late there have been a spate of movies, all relating to the Indo Gangetic Plain, which have freely used the vernacular color to the language more as a shock value rather than depiction of common conversation. I am certainly not a prude but I do shudder to think of what would be the end product if the Punjabi movie makers were to follow suit. Poor Santa and Banta are like soap water to this strong refresher course in abuses. But there's a sequel! The second part, of which a long trailer is shown after the end credits, promises to raise the bar further. And that also brings me to the concept of two part movies. It would be great fun if a saga is played out in different time periods but then each part has to be complete in itself. GOW fails here. Just when you thought things were getting interesting you are left dangling with a promise for more. The extended climax was needless and not in sync with story line that you were following. Maybe redemption follows in the next part. So what makes the movie work? For one it remains faithful to the milieu it is woven around. The spoken language, never mind the ear scorching expletives, does immense credit to the script writer. There is complete irreverence to the gross violence which is offset by the quirky and earthy humor. Extensively shot on location, the background of small towns, ordinary faces caught in extraordinary circumstances and racy dialogs combine to form an interesting potpourri. Mercifully the politicians and the gangsters have not been caricatured. The protagonists are the ordinary people, loving husbands and carnal adventurers who seek to justify every action as divinely decreed. And that sets Anurag Kashyap apart as leading the pack of parallel cinema makers. He manages to combine high drama and recognizable realism. The other makers of gangster sagas in Bollywood (read Ram Gopal Verma) have never been able to get over their obsession with the Godfather series so I am particularly delighted at the prospect of developing our own cult series and I do hope it goes beyond the revenge theme. The performances are power packed without exception. Manoj Bajpayee sizzles as the revenge seeking ordinary driver turned gang lord and his understated approach to the role is near perfect. Tigmanshu Dhulia dons the actor's mantle to portray the character based on Surya Deo Singh and acquits himself as the calculating Mafiosi pretty effectively. The honors however must go to Richa Chadda for her feisty portrayal of Manoj Bajpayee's strong headed wife who reluctantly accepts his philandering ways. She brought the house down when she exhorts him to eat well lest he \"under performs\" on his nocturnal trysts. Classic one liners like this keep the viewers interest alive just when the play begins to drag a little. I have to spare a few lines for Piyush Mishra. Maybe it's a little premature to say so but for once I am going to stick my neck out and dare to compare him with the all round mad genius of Kishore Kumar. This man is extraordinary. A writer, singer and an actor to boot !! I first saw, nay experienced his genius in Gulaal and was completely taken in by the force of his talent. GOW only further strengthens my belief that we are witnessing the unfolding of a legend. Like the great Kishore, he too does not respect any boundaries to his creative abilities. Just take time out to read his lyrics (for Gulaal as well as GOW) and you will see what I mean. There have been attempts to compare Kashyap with Tarantino which I would think is an insult to our boy. The only movie that makes Tarantino worthy is \"Inglorious Bastards\". But I have to admire him for the music selection for his films. And that is where he is comparable to our laddie. The music of GOW, so rustic in the Bhojpuri flavor, is a delight. I wonder if you have ever heard names like Sneha Khanwalkar, the Musahar of Sundarpur, Ranjeet Baal Party & Manish Tiwari. They are the guys who bring the tradition of minstrels of Bihar & UP alive. While Piyush Mishra transports you right back to the 50s with his soulful ballad the catchy beats of \"Hunter\" and \"O Womaniya\" will have your feet tapping. And then there is the highly unusual \"Bhaiyya\" which is just a rhythmic beat, at best a Bhojpuri trance fusion. Awesome stuff but everyone is going to talk about the risqu\u00e9 song. If you can ignore the double meaning it is going to ring in your ears for a long time to come. I already have the entire album and am a repeat listener. There is so much to like and/or criticize and so less to ignore. Kashyap is going to be liked by some and hated by others but he is never going to be ignored. Way to go !"
