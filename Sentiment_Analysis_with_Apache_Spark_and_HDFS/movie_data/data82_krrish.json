        "review_detailed_main": "Well Krrish is the highly awaited sequel to \"Koi mil gaya\". The wait is finely over.so how does it fare?Does it live up to the hype? well there could be mixed answers to this question.\n\nIts definitely better than the first part. But on the acting point of view it definitely disappoints. the film solely relies on Hrithik Roshan's shoulders and he delivers but this is certainly not his best as an actor though as krrish i cannot think of anybody else but him playing the role , all the other characters are just passable which include the highly talented \"Rekha\" who looks uncomfortable in the role of a grand mother.Priyanka Chopra looks good and is camera friendly though not much of the histrionics on her part.\n\nThe story is quite predictable with hardly any twists.The first half of the film is a mediocre boy meet girl romance with tracing the origins of krishna aka krrish. the music is alright though not as good as rajesh roshan's previous attempts. its only in the second half that film picks up and the special effects come into play.These special effects are good according to bollywood standards. Like any other superhero movie it does have a villain in Naseeruddin Shah.he has played roles as a villain like in \"Mohra\" before but this time hes strictly okay.\n\nThe film has high production values the director has handled the product well.But overall he's confused whether to churn out an out and out sci fi flick or a mix of all genres.The film was Promoted as a Super hero movie though its more of a romantic-super hero type. That thing could be due to the budget constraints it was not made as solely as a science fiction/super hero movie. The special effects look a mix of \"matrix\" ,\"crouching tiger hidden dragon\" and other action flicks . On the whole krrish traces the origins of our very own desi super hero. it could be the first in the series with more to come. I hope the sequel will be more of a super hero type with more CGI and special effects romped in.\n\nGo see krrish if you are a Hrithik Fan. you will not be disappointed.\n\nall an all a popcorn flick with a difference."

Krrish opened almost together with Superman Returns and is already eating a major share of business from the legendary super hero, which is a hint enough to mark the grand arrival of the Indian. World now seems a safe place, along with Superman, Batman and Spiderman, now we have Krrish to save the world from evils. The film invests a lot of time in evolution of a super hero from a common man. But once it arrives, you wish the movie runs for some more time... Krrish could do with some more action. the film ends just when your excitement is on the peak. Hrithik pulls the act very well, and Rakesh Roshan again proves that only he can extract best out of his boy. Though the movie is good, but not as good as its prequel Koi Mil Gaya, where you had 2 things to watch out for..splendid acting by Hrithik and Jadoo... This flick certainly lacks Jadoo... both the lovable alien and the cinematic magic... But I guess arrival of Indian Super hero could not have been better. Bravo and all the best Roshans."

The action sequences are splendid and spectacular; each and every action sequence is wonderfully crafted and some camera angles during the fights are surprisingly awesome. The special effects are surprisingly amazing for its time. The music is very good, though background score can be a bit intrusive at times.

        "review_title": "A critique of the criticisms",
        "review_detailed_main": "I have been lurking on this section for some time now, with a few raised eyebrows at some of the comments that have been passed here. I think some are just wholly unjustified and inaccurate.\n\nI have seen Krrish twice now. It is an unabashed popcorn entertainer. You're typical Hollywood special effects summer blockbuster, only that it has a unique Indian soul and the quintessential Bollywood elements. It is an accomplished blend of Indian popular storytelling , western technology and Asian action and it's historic success in India, proves how successful this fusion is.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most Hollywood film, where technology and action takes precedence, here special effects are minimally and virtuously(often seamlessly) used and most of the emphasis is on the emotional journey of the protagonist, who is reborn as the superhero, only towards the end, shifting to sci-fi action and concluding in a mesmerising ground-air-sea helicopter chase sequence, supported by an awesome and adrenaline-pumping background score.\n\nNow I am going to deal with the common issues made against Krissh:\n\n1. Action and special effects do not compare to Hollywood standards.\n\nYou really do need to define what Hollywood standards are. I have seen many big budget Hollywood special effects extravaganzas and the quality of special effects are variable; they range from good to bad; from shot to shot and from film to film.\n\nKrrish is nothing below \"Hollywood standards\" It has effects work that is on par or better than some Hollywood films, and less than some. What matters most, is do they work on their own terms, and given that masses of people, including international critics have appreciated them, means an emphatic yes.\n\n2. The techniques, effects and stunts are borrowed and/or plagiarised from Hollywood and Asian films; such as Crouching Tiger, House of flying daggers,Paycheck, Matrix.\n\nFirst of all, it would make sense that special effects techniques have been repeated from Hollywood, because the special effects supervisors - are from Hollywood.\n\nIt would make sense that the stunts and martial arts have been repeated from Asian films, because the stunt choreographer - is from Hong Kong.\n\nSecondly, techniques are invented to be reused. There is no need to reinvent the wheel.\n\nA filmmaker has at his utility an entire tool-kit of established techniques. It is how he uses them to actualise his vision that creates originality. In that respect, Rakesh Roshan is not a hack, because while he borrows techniques, he tailors them to his unique vision and lends them an originality of their own.\n\nThe stunts and action scenes have been designed according to Krrish's character and his own quirks, abilities and idiosyncrasies.\n\nIn particular, the final ground-air-sea helicopter chase sequence and the shot where Krrish uses the fountain jet to catapult him(awesome shot) into the air has never been done before. The anime-inspired fight sequence on the island is another spark of creativity. The initial sequence of him running to catch the glider is another very original sequence. Ditto for the Circus fire scene.\n\n3. Krrish is a mundane love story, comedy and drama for most of the film. Not enough superhero elements.\n\nWhen I watched Krrish the first time, I too echoed the same sentiments. I wanted to see more action scenes and superhero elements, not the usual run of the mill romantic comedy. I was disappointed. Then when I watched it the second time, this time without expecting a superhero film, I realised it's not suppose to be a superhero film; it is the beginning of a superhero\n\n4. Krrish is a hybrid of other superheros films and copies plot elements.\n\nSuperhero films are quite a predictable genre and share many similarities. They are the classic tale of good vs evil, where the hero is super-good and the villain is super-evil(often a megalomaniac with designs to take over the world) and the film builds to the final face-off, where good will invariably triumph. Superman follows the exactly the same story arc; so does Batman; so does Spiderman; and yes, so does Krrish.\n\nAnother similarity is that the superhero-ego will often be incognito and not reveal their true identity, except to a select few. You see this in Superman; Spiderman and Batman; so, you also see it in Krrish. Again, because the superhero is mysterious, they become the talk of the world and the the press become obsessed with them and in unveiling their identity. You see this in Superman; Spiderman and Batman; so you see it in Krrish.\n\nKrrish is as original and unoriginal as any superhero film. If you can accept that Superman is not a copy of Spiderman and Spiderman is not a copy of Batman. Then you should be able to accept that Krrish is not a copy of either of them and stands as an original work.\n\n5. Krrish is just the usual Bollywood potboiler, with songs and dances, comedy, melodrama and colours.\n\nSo are 99.9% of Bollywood films. This is the unique Bollywood identity and film-making heritage and make no mistake about it, Krrish is an all-out Bollywood film, made for mass consumption by Bollywood fans.\n\nKrrish is a very commendable and well-made film, an all out-entertainer, with plenty of cool action and special effects, but with it's heart in it's story of Krishna becoming Krrish(played admirably by Hrithik Roshan) It's also a historic milestone in Indian film-making, and will be to Indian cinema, what Superman was to American cinema. Expect the sequel to even bigger.\n\nAn impressive and world-class entry by Bollywood to the fantastic world of sci-fi and fantasy. I look forward to more such films from Bollywood. In fact, as I write , another Bollywood director is in the preproduction phase of a big budget futuristic sci-fi romance set in 2050 India, and not an ordinary love story, it's the love story between a robot and a human!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Krrish draws parallel similarities to many Hollywood movies in terms of scenes and stunts; But The movie is well made and it stands out overall and seems to be paying \"Homage\" to these greats! One would have to be very negative in calling Krrish a rip-off/hackneyed, considering the core story is general showing the genesis of a hero and the destruction of evil. I'd say about 10% of the movie's screenplay has been copied from Hollywood movies such as The Matrix (some fight sequences), Shaolin Soccer (Some fight sequences, volleyball match), Batman Begins (Angry Krrish fighting thugs), Daredevil (Jumping at times), Spiderman (saving kids from burning circus and jumping through a truck with a container attached), Superman I (running past a bus with kids in), Kevin Costner's patented swimming from Waterworld and more importantly PAYCHECK (The lab, the equipment and the concept of seeing the future and trying to change it)!!! The end bit though made many people including me laugh (not meant to) when the computer (From The grandpa era) makes the same sounds used initially to contact the aliens. On the whole .. enough songs not to bore you and enough action and fantasy for your money's worth for the first time in years!!! The background music is on par with Hollywood big budget movies yet it falters when they show the villain .. The Roshans do a very good job overall, All the characters seem three Dee .. 6.5/10!\n\nKrishna Mehra's father was killed in a laboratory fire overseas (minutes after he was born) and his mother died as she could not bear her husband's death. Krishna at age 5 was discovered by his school's headmaster and his grandmother to be able to answer questions that usually search grade twelve 'science majors'. This becomes a problem for some reason for the grandmother and she and Krishna disappear from the eyes of people they know into the wilderness. The boy is so gifted, he has feet that can walk on water and air, he can outrun a horse (reminicent of Shadowfax from LOTR), he can climb mountains and trees faster than apes. The boy turns into a handsome man so innocent and untouched by the outside world that he seems too naive for his age. His only friends are birds, fishes, apes, some village kids, an idiot and all other creatures you can imagine (leave out the poor roaches!). One day he miraculously rescues an angel who fell from the sky onto tree tops because of a parachute accident (Priyanka Chopra), a series of funny incidents follow which include ghost stories and Priya's (Chopra) camp organizer Mr. Komal (Puneet Issar) recording a fever of 104 C. Soon everything is out in the open, Krishna is in Love with Ms. Priya (she isn't) and her holiday ends and she's back in Singapore. Since she and her friend Honey are late, Honey cover's their butt by convincing their boss of a story for their channel 'STAR' which will show the Indian Superboy (??)! Priya unwantingly cajoles Krishna to come to Singapore and ask her hand in Marriage from her mother else she'd be married off elsewhere. Krishna decides to go for it and has an argument with grandma as to why he can't leave? Grandma the wise explains \"Your father was gifted with special powers and was renowned worldwide for his intelligence. He died because of a lab fire caused in the presence of people who exploited his powers for the innocent boy he was. MAMA died in grief. I don't want to loose you too!\" However she gives in and tells him \"Go ... get her\"\n\nPost-Interval, Krishna is in Singapore and what follows is his glamorous and spectacular display of martial arts skills (he picks up by watching for a few seconds) to get some money for a disabled Asian girl's operation. Next he rescues (now wearing a mask not to reveal his identity as grandma said so!) people from a burning circus (again jaw dropping). \"Krrish\" (kid asks name .. 'Krish' comes out) is all over the news and reward is offered. Krishna's friend (asian girl's brother .. Chirs Lee) finds his true identity and is joyous for him. Krissh doesn't want the reward or fame and tells Chris to claim the reward by giving Chris his mask to have enough money to get his sister operated on (a small piece of the mask was extracted from the circus and would be used to match in order to present the S$25,000 award). Meanwhile, Dr. Aryan has almost completed his 20 year dream of building a machine that can see the future (project started by Krishna's father; this was the lab where destruction and death took place). Krish has to discover a truth about his father's past and rescue the world from this power-mongering megalomaniac."

        "review_detailed_main": "The very first Indian movie I saw in its entirety as a kid, was Annamalai, starring Superstar Rajnikanth. Since then I was intrigued by Indian cinema, but never found the patience nor the time to sit through the standard fare of at least 2.5-3hrs of pure spectacle. On and off I caught bits and pieces of movies shown on TV, and the last Bollywood movie I saw mid-way, was Shah Rukh Khan's Asoka, and that's it.\n\nKrrish is a sequel to the blockbuster Koi... Mil Gaya, also directed by Rakesh Roshan, but no worries if you haven't seen the first movie - you'll be brought up to speed in no time, and Krrish will also work if it stood alone. First off, it's a superhero movie combined with science fiction, so that was a plus point to have this movie reintroduce me to Bollywood once again. And it worked. With romance, action, and some comedy thrown into the mix, what can one ask for more for pure entertainment?\n\nThose not familiar with Bollywood movies might balk at the length of Krrish - almost 5 minutes shy of 3 hours, which is quite standard runtime fare (there is a clearly marked \"interval\" in the movie, but it was not utilized here). But I tell you that you won't feel its length, and will actually secretly hope that it continues some more. The first hour dwelled on the introduction of our hero Krishna (Hrithik Roshan), a man born with extraordinary powers, whose grandmother Sonia took upon herself to shield him from a world awaiting to exploit his talent, if discovered. It's like a visit to the Kent farm, except that the whole grandmother- son relationship looked more at home vis-a-vis Spiderman's Aunt May and Peter Parker.\n\nWhen Krishna meets Priya (the gorgeous Priyanka Chopra, Miss World 2000) by chance during her adventure holiday camp, and he becomes smitten with her, moving the movie towards a romance. She's the quintessential Singapore modern career girl, who puts career (or trying to salvage it) before love, and therein complicates matters of the heart when we get to the boy-momentarily-loses-girl bit. Plenty of drama in this area, though it doesn't dwell too long on it, increasing the pace for the action bits.\n\nThose eager to see Krrish, the superhero, will have to wait almost 2 hours before he makes an appearance in full costume. He's like Jet Li's cousin Black Mask with the black outfit and abilities, but with a better looking facial piece to disguise his identity. But with or without costume, we see Krishna's prowess through various stunt and fight choreography enhanced by wirework from one of Hong Kong's stunt masters, Chen Siu-Tung, especially in his \"qing gong\" abilities to glide effortlessly through the air like Chinese martial artists. There's also a showpiece for Hrithik to demonstrate the kung-fu skills picked up, and the fights, if compared with other Bollywood movies, have toned down its cheesy sound effects and credibility issues because of its premise (if a superhero punches you, you'll definitely fly what).\n\nAnd what's a Bollywood flick without song and dance? Yes, our hero sings and dances when romancing his love, from the mountains in India to the skyscrapers in Singapore, but he doesn't do so as his alter-ego Krrish (yup, just let the superhero stick to kicking serious rear). There are 5 beautiful songs in Krrish, and save for the one in the circus, the rest did not involve mass dancing by extras, which kept the focus purely on the leads. And the dance choreography was pretty amazing too, though I was surprised that Hrithik Roshan, given his muscular bulk, could dance so gracefully. Oh, did I mention Priyanka Chopra is gorgeous?\n\nWhile the romance and action bit were interesting, the science fiction bit was unfortunately found wanting. Not that it was bad, but because it was too familiar. Adapting the same plot as Philip K Dick's Paycheck, the sets, premise and plot device looked exactly the same as John Woo's Paycheck movie - we have the evil Dr Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) building a supercomputer which can look into the future, and therefore becoming God himself. The evil lair too looked like Woo's underground lair in M:I2, complete with pigeons (no doves in Singapore).\n\nFor those who want to know more about the local landmarks used - Singapore Expo was used quite a bit, since it's large enough to be filmed at different areas passing off as different venues, even doubling up as Changi Airport's arrival hall entrance with smart editing. The Esplanade was another choice location as the HQ of a conglomerate run by Dr Arya, with National Library's Pod doubling as the penthouse office. There are many scenes with glass windows, which will clue you in on the location of the current setting. Other notable locations are the condos at Kallang, Shenton Way / Raffles Place, Lau Pa Sat (widely publicized during the shoot here), the Singapore River and our offshore islands.\n\nKrrish reminded me that cinema is about the big spectacle, and I encourage anyone who's into song, dance, and especially those interested in seeing local landmarks make their way into movies, to give Krrish a shot. It made Singapore look sexy, and probably showed us a different angle in making an action movie here. While awaiting the arrival of Singer's Man of Steel, watch Krrish!"

Of all the Indian superhero movies made so far, i would say this was perhaps the least worst. People say it is copied and what not (then again we've all come to expect that of most bollywood films), but the fact is that the movie lacked general direction and purpose, thus a lot of the scenes were a drag. In addition, the plot seemed to be non-existent, and the sub plot was very weak. a movie with very general ideas that requires viewers to turn a blind eye to various plot holes. for example, kirsh and his father, despite a whole generation gap, seemed to be living in the same time period. even though i tried my best to watch the whole movie, it got too mind-numbingly boring thus i had to walk out about two thirds of the way through. and off the 4 people i sat down to watch the movie with, only 1 managed to see the whole thing. i found out from them what happens in the end, and by the sounds of things, i am very glad i walked out and saved myself and hour. Overall, this movie robbed me of two hours of my life which i shall never get back. still 3 very generous points awarded for the effort."

Of course, if you've seen Hollywood action movies then you might not be able to sincerely enjoy the action shots of Krrish. Though they are definitely a very new and attracting thing to the crowds of people engrossed in Hindi movies, the action will seem slightly artificial to those who aren't. Still, the movie does bring out the acting talents of both Hrithik and Priyanka. The movie has a very fresh look to it and the colors, sceneries and costumes not only suite the story but also the characters.\n\nThis movie proves that the Roshans are willing to take risks and Hrithik beautifully brings about the critical points of the two different characters that he plays. They have evidently put in a whole lot of effort and they deserve to be applauded.\n\nIf you haven't seen Krrish then I suggest you go and do so but, remember to keep an open mind and an accepting attitude when and if you do go to see it. It is an enriching experience that makes you feel proud to be an Indian."

In second half story of Rohit, Krishna becomes Krrish and story between Priayanka and Krishna going together and it confuses sometimes.\n\nRakesh Roshan also did not gives more detail on character of Krrish and his powers.What powers he possess and what are weakness and also no details on character of Rohit and his wife.Why Rohit does not possess that powers which his son gets.\n\nWell there are some good points also in movie like twist of rohit is live and also how krishna becomes accidental hero in circus fire. Action is very less but it is good.\n\nHrithik is main actor in whole movie and he done superb job but Priyanka disappoints and therefore first half seems very slow.\n\nAll and all the movie which can be watched at least onetime and maximum only one time. It is good but we want more Krrish in Krrish than Krishna."

But sometimes second thoughts are handy. The second half of the story is fun to watch. The hype of the Indian superhero is worth all its claims!!\n\nHrithik is a treat to watch in the second half. But Priyanka Chopra? She doesn't fit into the category of sweet, innocent girl which she tries to be in the beginning. \"Just imagine\", bahadur, played by Hemant Pandey had good comic timing!!\n\nThe film starts off with Rohit junior i.e. Krishna showcasing his talent as a painter. Later, realization of the fact that Krishna is a whizkid after the IQ test. Rekha being a protective grandma, takes him away from the eyes of the cruel, selfish word.\n\nAlthough which part of the world they were staying, they kept it a hush - hush secret affair with the audience also!! Not fair, at least they could have told us!!\n\nKrishna grows up in the armor of nature. Birds and animals are his compatriots, no wonder he dances like kangaroo!! Good logic!! Transitions are wonderful, like the one where Krishna's tear turns out into the Dragon head, establishing Singapore. Amazing display of stunts, Superman, you better Return!!\n\nThere is a surprise element in the film, which shows that it has a better thought of screenplay!! Unlike other superheroes, here Krishna, Christianizes his own name Krrish!!!\n\n\"When it comes to Hrithik, Roshan senior is very demanding\", I thought of this line because the original choice of the actress was Aishwarya. Think people as where was this line used. Piyush Shah did an excellent job in the department of cinematography!! I must say, for a change it's a refreshing Hindi film sequel!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Krrish's script writer (or whoever conceptualized the character of Krrish) watched lots of super man and sci-fi foreign movies and turned Krrish, the hero and the movie a mixture of all. Sample these:\n\nKrrish dresses like Zorro (the mask, the leather overcoat in 30 degree hot Singapore). - Krrish runs in the air and jump across and over like Incredible Hulk. - Krrish can jump over/ across city landmarks like Spiderman (eg, when he sneaks into Dr Arya's lab.) - Krrish runs as fast as Dash Incredible of the Incredibles. (eg, where he avoids bullets from Dr Arya) - Krrish can fight like a Kung Fu warrior (when he fights Dr Arya's guards on an island) or like Jackie Chan (eg, when he fights motorcycle riders. (The lead, Hrithik trained for 1 month+ under the famous Tony Cheng of Hong Kong.) - Krrish can, of course, sing like an Indian hero. - Krrish's father Rohit builds a computer that can see future like Precogs of Minority Report. He works on intangible keyboards like in that movie. Rohit is kept in suspended animation by Dr Arya as the convicts in Minority Report. - Krrish's father Rohit can read like autistic Raymond in Rain Man (Rohit finishes Dr Arya's book in minutes.) - Krrish's father Rohit meets with a left-behind alien (as in ET, the Hollywood movie which stole the idea, some credibly claim, from India's Satyajit Ray.)\n\n\nCut the dance sequence, reduce the length to 90-120 minutes. The movie may be accepted by global audience and I would rate it 7/10.\n\nAs an aside, Singapore government invested in the movie which was half shot in Singapore. Krrish is/will be a case study for business schools (Indian Institute of Management-Indore, Hongkong University, Harvard Business School.)"

Indian films are longer than Hollywood/European films, but it didn't feel long at all. Must have been entertaining! It did not matter at all that the film makers had borrowed ideas from other films(Flying Daggers, ET, Dr.Who, whatever). The film was very Indian and didn't feel like a copy of anything. I loved the music and dances, the dance in the circus was wonderful!\n\nThe actor who played Krrish felt quite right for the role. I have seen him in KKKB, but didn't think much about him then, was too fascinated by Sharukh. This is my first film critic ever! Becoming addicted to Indian films make me do strange things!!"

The songs were great and was pictured beautifully, especially in the first half in the mountains. The special effects were mind-blowing for an Indian film and the stunts were great! This film is good for children and adults alike. I really recommend this film to anyone. There was bits of the film which dragged on a bit, and really wasn't needed, but there were more good bits then bad. One bit i loved was the twist at the end.. but you'll have to watch the film to find out!"

With \"Khoon Bhari Mang,\" he introduced the concept of cosmetic surgery, idea of extra terrestrials in Koi Mil Gaya and superhero theme in \"Krish\" , which is also a sequel to \"Koi Mil Gaya.\" Technically \"Krish\" supersedes \"Koi Mil Gaya\" in terms of production values, sets and overall the trick photography. Story-wise too the film gets interesting especially in the second half with much of the excitement. The first half is however a bit dragging missing the innocence of \"Koi Mil Gaya.\" Overall, the film is impressive in the technical aspects like photography and special effects which is seldom seen in Hindi movies which makes it Rakesh Roshan's best effort though it contains the ordinary clich\u00e9s of Hindi Movies like the regular villains and improbabilities.\n\nRating: 3 stars out of 4"

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, filled with the usually bollywood song and dance, and these didn't really stand out for me, totally skippable, though the Circus dance was somewhat bearable. Hrithik has a few fun moves in a couple of the other songs as well.\n\nI found while some points in the movie contained some very nice cinematography, and some flair in style with the occasional humorous bit (two brightly dressed Indian women (beautiful actresses as well) arguing in an elevator with the random average looking dude in-between them trying to follow what's going on... just priceless, couldn't help but laugh at that.\n\nThe costume change was innovative, and a improvement, and the whole hair thing seemed to work out, since, it totally could have been Krishna's buddy.\n\nI just found the beginning to be horribly weak, overacted (but that's normal) and over dramatized (also normal) Krishna still seemed a bit to childish, and i'm not sure if it's just Hritihiks acting, or a bad interpretation of the character.. why set him up smart, only to have him act like a little kid throughout the movie... (though there were points I could feel some brilliance coming through, sortuv...) It wasn't until perhaps the last half hour... suddenly everything started to blow my mind... like it got so crazy with effects and everything.... maybe the whole last half... but just the action bits, and the flashbacks... it just kinda worked, all the special effects were cheesy yet awesome, and it seemed to steal from just about every major super hero/action movie. X-men, Batman (pick one) Superman (again pick one) Matrix, also, Anime in general .... The jungle scene where he fights the island security was right out of Naturo, or ... any anime... the older the more sense it makes... with the blurry background, and random moves, and then the stop.... PERFECT! i nearly peed my pants it was so awesome... at that point you just can't take the rest of the movie seriously, because everything that happens, it just *awesome* all kinds of random special effects, and power display and illogical hostage situation... (seems like the bad guy's taunt him with things only Krishna would want... except... why would they do that unless they knew it was him? ) UGH The Lay's chips in multiple scenes was a nice touch.. or some kind of advertising deal... not sure which... also, the Black Eyed Peas poster in the office at work...\n\nI kept seeing plot holes, and perhaps this is all better for a thread... basically: The movie is too long, and boring up to the intermission, and even then, it's kinda bad, but it becomes a action/special effects fest at the end, and it's just too fun to miss... it's what i was waiting for, the entire movie... made me happier than when I saw the Main Hoon Na final fight scene (which is worth a see, it's just so ridiculously bad, it's awesomely good!) Thank you Rakesh Roshan for bringing something different into Bollywood, it may be a crappy movie, but it looks professional, and flashy, and it has just enough plot a nd action to make me happy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Krrish is an Indian superhero film which makes for interesting viewing in the light of such mixed Hollywood outings as Daredevil, Spiderman, X-Men etc. Hidden by his mother from the enemies of his late, genius father, hero Krishna has inherited enhanced superpowers granted to his dad by kindly aliens in the first installment of the saga. Swept off his feet by a visiting female journalist in his remote retreat, at length he reluctantly returns to Singapore only to discover that elements of the past tragedy may not be what they seem. Soon he is forced to don a mask to hide his real identity and battles against a technological conspiracy which has at its heart a personal imperative.\n\nOverlong and entertaining, Krrish has many of the merits and faults of Indian popular cinema, while still providing a novel experience for fans of the western superhero genre. Most interestingly, the Indian superhero has few of the neuroses and persecution complexes which mark out his western counterparts, never viewing his superhuman nature as a curse for instance. His special talents seem part of nature and not a dubious mutation of it. The first half of the film, consisting of a slow moving romance as Krrish, living with his overprotective auntie, discovers his heart and his destiny, has one or two decent moments but one longs for more outright drama. Notable scenes include the first meeting with his co star as he romances her, Tarzan-like, descending down a tree together in a prolonged arboreal embrace after a hang glider crash above. But these are meager highlights in what proves a slight and generally unmemorable opening act.\n\nThings pick up considerably however after the half time intermission as, once installed in Singapore, Krrish moves into a different gear entirely. In the film's best and most excitingly choreographed sequence, the hero first dons his improvised mask to rescue victims trapped inside a burning circus tent while later, in another impressive moment, he leapfrogs across boats on the river to reach his enemies. Most of the wire-work based stunts in the film are well done and some - such as the moment when he slides his motor cycle along a warehouse floor to unseat several other riders, are exciting and new. Krrish's super powers mainly consist of Dr Doolittle-like communication powers with animals, super strength and speed, but there is no denying that in the requisite black mask, with streaming hair and Matrix mac he looks very cool when required. Ultimately though it has to be admitted that the film is not a complete success; the central conceit of a computer that can 'foretell the future' for instance is a clumsy one and, while Krrish is a great action figure, the film itself seems uncertain on which elements of his character to concentrate on, which leads to some loss of focus. But a decent enough effort all the same."

Also, I did not know this was a sequel. So it was a surprise when the film takes this sudden weird twist. The best thing to say about this film, is that it is a mix of many different genres and this sometimes works and sometimes does not - but if you go in expecting a lot, you will not like it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Krrish is a unique movie that combines many elements and genres. Reviewing this film is no easy task; reviewing it objectively is even harder. This is because Krrish breaks many of the expectations of a western moviegoer. It's action is unusual, its acting is often exaggerated, not to mention that its in a foreign language! Getting a good perspective on the film is hard when it doesn't look anything like the movie one was looking for. So, let me just get my bias out on the table early on in this review. I loved it! I haven't laughed that hard in any action movie ever. I haven't seen fights that good in any comedy ever. Nor have I ever seen music videos like those in any sci-fi super hero flick. I love the crazy place this movie has found in terms of genre. This film moves easily from pop music video to manga-style action to touching drama to thought provoking sci-fi. It's just great.\n\nHowever, the bizarre amount of slapstick comedy, product placement/general commercialism, and constant switching of genre may very well put some western viewers off. This movie is not your usual super hero flick. Batman this is not.\n\nIt is, however, an excellent movie that combines the core elements of the super hero genre with romance, comedy, and sci-fi, and does this quite effectively, thanks to the good dialogue, great choreography and effects, and great acting and dancing by Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra.\n\nI was thoroughly entertained and would recommend this film to just about anyone who is willing to suspend disbelief, sit back, and enjoy the show."

But \"Krrish\" is so sappy and so one dimensional that even the most ardent fans of Hrithik, such as myself, found it difficult to sit through the overly sentimentalized movie. I wanted to wipe the perpetual smile off of his face and the almost infantile portrayal of the super hero was as flat as a day old chappati. The songs and dances will be forgotten as soon as you exit the theatre. And Priyanka Chopra is not someone who lights up the screen with her acting abilities. Nasiruddin Shah was having fun with his over the top villain role and not much else. The dialogue was so bland and cheesy and the stunts were from Matrix 101. That was the biggest disappoint. Hrithik just does not come off as a super hero and more's the pity. If there is a sequel to this, please Rakesh Roshan, hire a qualified script writer and give a better grip to the story with more shades of grey to the characters. I hope to see Hrithik soon in a better written film. He is a good actor wasted in substandard films. Maybe he should do a couple of films with Ram Gopal Verma to wipe out his goodtwoshoes image."

To my pleasant surprise, the film is remarkably watchable, due mainly to the 'fun and fantasy' element which Roshan Sr. gets right.\n\nPlotwise, the film is not much different from other superhero films, but then one doesn't watch these film for plot or character. Hrithik Roshan is quite good as Krishna/Krrish, though one wishes they had injected a bit more psychological depth into Krishna- he is a unilateral character who only seems to operate in \"nice\" mode. Naseeruddin Shah is expectedly satisfactory, as is Rekha who delivers most of the films moments of pathos. Priyanks Chopra is perhaps the least impressive of the lot. She isn't the 'typical heroine' here, but her delivery comes off as mechanical in several scenes. She needs to can the plaintive crying from here on out. Plus those attempts at imitating Juhi Chawla's cutie pie facial expressions don't gel well with her duplicitous persona. If they were going to cast her as a deceiver, they should have gone the whole hog and made her a last-minute redeemer.\n\nThe special effects are quite good and the technical team deserves full recognition for putting together a film that is visually awe-inspiring. The major flaw of the film are its songs, which are neither particularly memorable nor necessary to the film. But hey, even superheroes should get to sing and dance (and dance he does, extraordinarily in \"Dil Na Diya\")."

        "review_detailed_main": "Finally a superhero of our own...Krrish has arrived! The anticipation for this film was immense, especially after the success of Koi Mil Gaya, but unfortunately for me it did not live up to the hype.\n\nRakesh Roshan is an excellent story teller - Khoon Bhari Mang, Karan Arjun, Koyla, Kaho Na Pyar Hai, Koi Mil Gaya but there's always a level of 'unrealistic' in his films! Krrish is not Rakesh's finest work - that mantle piece would certainly go to Koi Mil Gaya, but Krrish comes off nicely from here and makes you wait anxiously for the next version - Krrish 3!\n\nThe film is a little slow, and does not contain much of the superhero action as you expect once you watch the trailer.\n\nHrithik Roshan, as he was with Koi Mil Gaya, is the soul of Krrish and plays the role of both father and son with supreme ease! The simple truth is that his role as Rohit (an older version now) is far more demanding than his role as Krrishna (minus the stunts). Hrithik is fantastic in every scene, and his chemistry with Priyanka is pleasant. The way he slides into the role of Krrish so simply yet effectively shows that this actor is on top of his game.\n\nThis is far from Priyanka Chopra's best work, but then again the role doesn't require her to be at her best, but she comes across annoying at times (maybe that was required), but on the whole she does well. Naseeruddin Shah has always been a fantastic actor, but his role as Dr Arya doesn't quite come across that well. I know Rakesh wanted a more senior actor to play the villain role, but perhaps someone like Anupam Kher would have done a better job.\n\nThe music of the film is decent with my favourites being Koi Tumsa Nahin and Main Hoon Woh Aasman, but the background theme music by Salim-Sulaiman is fantastic and sets the tone well.\n\nOverall Krrish is slightly overrated, but once you watch Krrish 3, you realise why it's quite slow...it was simply a build up to the big show!"

I am not in mood to write full fledge review so will write main points.\n\nRakesh Roshan tries to make this flick mix of 'Superhero' and 'Love Story' and thats where the muvy flatters I have to rethink the movie name while watching whether its name is 'Krrish-Love story of a Superhero' or 'Krrish' Cauz this muvy takes ur almost 2 hrs out of 3 hours in establishing Hrithik-Priyanka love story While the future vision idea was lift up from John Woo's 'Paycheck' but even that doesnot support this mediocre flick cauz that idea is only around for sometime in movie while most of the time movie wanders around Hrithik-Priyanka love story.\n\nNow the actions.There was nothing like never seen before for those who have seen 'Matrix' and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' But looking at budget and all i can say that was good attempt.\n\nSuperhero flicks needs more to be at point rather than every now n then going into emotional themes. This movie is made for the kids and will be liked mainly by the kids. And inspite of being E.T ripoff Koi Mil Gaya was much better product The biggest disappointment is Rakesh Roshan's direction who tries to mix mag things\n\nNow music.Music is big letdown as we know already.However if u have heard it few times before it will not hamper muvy progress However RR should take care of better music next time.\n\nActing-Inspite of being good footage Priyanka hardly leaves an impression.Sometimes she looks amazing,sometimes horrible And her friend not only looks horrible but she acts horrible too Hritik's friend whose name is perhaps Hemant Pandey is good Nasruddin Shah overacts and a villain who could have send a chill in blood makes a laughable material by his news act and all. The only actor who leaves most impression after Hrithik is offcourse Rekha.She makes you believe however short her role is written she can act gracefully.\n\nAnd,i will end on a positive rating due to two reasons.First cause of attempt of 'Superhero' flick which will open doors for more such flicks in bollywood cause of its commercial success.\n\nSecond and most strong point is Hrithik's sterling act.He is the heart and soul of the movie. And he is the only reason to watch this flick which is a forgettable and kiddish affair.\n\n3/5"

I didn't have very high expectations, but after watching it, I was blown away.\n\nKrrish is a film about India's first superhero. It starts with a young man named Krishna, who lives in rural India with his grandmother. Krishna has several unique abilities, including super-strength, super-speed, enhanced intelligence and levitation. One day, Krishna meets and falls in love with a young woman named Priya. After she goes home to Singapore, Krishna follows and hopes to ask Priya to marry him. In Singapore, he finds reasons to uses his powers to help mankind, including fighting a mad scientist named Dr. Arya. He becomes Krrish, the icon of millions of people.\n\nKrrish is just an awesome movie. It has plenty of action, romance, humor and super-heroics. On top of all of that, I saw the movie as an up-close look at modern Indian culture. All in all, I thought this movie was great and Bollywood rocks.\n\nIf you love superhero movies you with love this movie.\n\nThe movie has since been removed from Youtube. I hope I can find it again."

Hrithik Roshan looks good as always but as far as performance and acting goes he is still a kid... a kid encouraged and crowned by the Indian media... but it doest makes any difference.. if you want to see some Hollywood stolen special effects (and that too in poor performance), some idiotic dialogues and childish acting by Hrithik Roshan and want to waste some hours and in the end scratch your head and shout.. then you can watch it..otherwise let the children watch it and dream about being krrish... Brithik has done a good job in Dhoom 2 (he was the only one to do a good job) and I think he must focus more on such movies than being a clown like Krrish... this ain't a superhit but it is all the hype and publicity ...which is bad for bollywood itself... from the view of critics... in the end... good movie for children to watch but if this one gets any award (best actor/story/movie), then I got ONE word for this crap ...

No man, don't even think about making the third part for this film. And what's up with the script, character artists and everything? Mr. Rakesh Roshan must take few lessons on writing a powerful screenplay and get rid of lame language. The big problem with the thing is that the Roshans have managed to make a 2006 movie with recipe, that worked only 11 years ago. They've failed to realize they're not making Karan Arjun.

Special effects were great and extremely well done. If you haven't seen a bollywood film before, this is an excellent one to start with. You don't necessarily have to have seen Koi Mil Gaya to understand and appreciate Krrish but it does help with some things.\n\nThe cinema I saw this in was packed full and everyone in the audience loved it, so much so they were cheering for the good guys and booing at the villains and giving huge applause at the end.

Producing a good quality product and probably the first mega-hit SEQUEL with a steady increasing pace, that goes from 0-500mph by the time the movie is over requires planning, control and execution. RR delivers big time.\n\nHrithik takes RR's vision and makes it even better by performing at the highest level. If we are talking about a SuperStar phenomenon after the Big B, with a combination of Personality, Built, Charisma and Consistency, IMHO Hrithik will be IT in the years to come. The improvements needed would be a little more aggressiveness in angry roles.\n\nKRRISH does begin where Koi Mil Gaya ended...and as the movie progresses does seal itself as a true sequel. When you walk out in the end, you feel justice is served to KMG.\n\nThe humor in the first half, the sequence of events, the songs (which are part of the movie, rather than being stuffed into the movie) \"Chori chori...\", \"Aao Suanoon Pyar ki..\" and \"Dil Na Diya..\" (what an amazing dance number by HK in the 2nd half) are refreshing. Action scenes do have the signature of HongKong Martial arts master Siu-Tung Ching, a little less in the 1st half and it takes quite a bit to introduce the character Krrish, which comes into existence only 15-20mins after the interval. The action is increasingly more than you can imagine in the 2nd half. The special effects are first rate.\n\nN.Shah is just amazing as Dr. Arya and it would have been nice to see more of him but would have made it unnecessary. If Rekha and Hrithik deliver the most emotional performances throughout the film, Hemant Pandey, Puneet Issar, Priyanka & friends provide the comic relief in the first half. Sharat Saxena is menacing with his looks. APSingh is the perfect B****yBoss and the Chinese guy Gin Xia for his brief stunts\n\nOverall - Great Entertainer and yes I'd like a sequel to Krrish :-)\n\nSome Dings at KRRISH - The first child actor who plays Krishna is quite irritating (thanks to only a 5 min role), Introduciton of the character Krrish could've been a bit sooner in the film, The films length (the last song could've been cut even if it gets under your skin over time due to its softness and awesome picturization)."

Hritik Roshan shows why his ilk, all the sons of former bollywood superstars, are no match for the khans. i hope all that waxing and steroids have paid off. personally though id prefer a Bachchan in a superhero role because at least they look nominally Indian. Naseeruddin shah is completely out of place. Rekha's talents are also wasted.\n\noverall, i hope u guys don't fork out the $10 per ticket we have to here in America to watch this garbage."

In fact, they did quite the opposite; I cherished the film. Bollywood rarely has sequels; the Roshans set the record in Bollywood by making the first Bollywoood sequel to their film, Koi...Mil Gaya, which happens to be the first sci-fi Bollywood film. They follow it up with the first Bollywood superhero flick shot for the first time, if I'm not wrong,in the foreign land of Singapore. Altogther, the father-son duo have set 4 records in Bollywood: the first idea of a sequel, the first sci-fi Bollywood film, the first Bollywood superhero flick and the first-time Bollywood shoot in Singapore, courtesy of the Singapore Tourism Board.\n\nHrithik is undoubted the star of the film, he steals from the very blend Priyanka Chopra but villain Naseerudin Shah and Veteran Rekha hold their own territories. Hrithik has a great body but I wish he will stop smiling too much throughout the film as he does not exactly have the best smile in Bollywood.\n\nBesides heroine Priyanka, the music, of which only 'Ek Ladki' and the theme music stand out, is a buss.\n\nFor those criticizing fellow Indians out there who lash out at the film 'inoriginality' and the 'imitation of Hollywood', they ought to be proud that India can at least churn out a special effects galore with believable superhero and an original Indian-type sentimental background story, ignoring the superhero stuff."

He is loud and garish and all his movements are overstated and exaggerated. He loves the camera and every shot looks like it has been framed for a modeling assignment. Not to mention that IN NEARLY EVERY SCENE THE WIND IS BLOWING INTO HIS WILD MANLY LOCKS GIVING ME THE FEELING THAT HE IS A PROSTITUTE AND THE MOVIE AND THE DIRECTORS ARE HIS PIMPS SHOWING HIM OFF THE WORLD. His presence on screen is overbearing and unpleasant in many sequences. Add to that he takes every opportunity to break into dance using exaggerated movements and dances too expressively as if he were a choreographer and not a star. I Don't KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING WHEN THEY SAY HE IS A GOOD ACTOR EVEN YOU AND I CAN ACT LIKE A SPASTIC ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SPASTICS BEHAVE IN MANY WAYS AND ALL YOU DO IS TO BEHAVE WEIRDLY AND BAM YOU ARE A SPASTIC, TO ACT AND SPEAK AS NORMAL PEOLE DO IS THE REAL CHALLENGE.\n\nTheir TAKE\n\nWe love Hritik and we don't care if he can't act he looks great and the more we see of him to the better. He looks cool with his black coat and his black mask and as long as he continues to look good we will continue to worship him. Not to mention cheer every time he gives another one of his classy poses.\n\nMY OPINION\n\nThe COMPUTER ANIMATION IS THE BEST IN Indian CINEMA but its overused and you get the feeling that a child has been handled a new toy and he wants to carry it around wherever he goes. So we have totally unnecessary instances of the graphics being used specially in a long chase sequence, a couple of songs, and motorbike fight scene. HOWEVER EVEN THE BEST IN Indian CINEMA HARDLY COMPARES TO A B GRADE Hollywood FLICK.\n\nTheir TAKE\n\nDid that guy just kick a bike that went and rammed into 3 4 other bikes, hell we love it. Did you see we had one Hritik dancing and now we have another one dancing on the building. That's 2 Hritiks side by side. We totally love this movie. We haven't seen graphics of this quality ever in a Hindi film and the more we get the better. I'm so excited let me whistle.\n\nPoints where we agree....\n\nOUR OPINION\n\nThe songs in the first half were fine (though not good and definitely not even as good as KMG) but the ones in the second half were irritating just when we see the action has started and we finally begin to see some fast movement in the plot and some good action and romantic sequences, suddenly we have to see our superhero dancing around like a stray rubber band to ordinary lacklustre songs. Why are scenes even involving Hritik talking have 50% of the screen having Singapore sprawling scenery.\n\nOUR OPINION\n\nSome scenes were really good such as the airport robbery scene, the show fighting scene, the initial comic scenes.\n\nI will deny this later but the romantic scenes were expertly handled, I've never been in love but I guess any village boy who is shown love by a city hottie will act in a similar way to Krissh. Also I got acquainted to girls very late in life (18), the awkwardness and excitement one feels when one makes his first friend who is a girl is something I can identify with (thanks J and Shilpa ).\n\nWE LOVE NASEERUDIN\n\nHis comic intercepts and menacing tone were perfect for the film and this is one villain who will stand out in for a long time. For me he was clearly the best thing in the movie.\n\nFINE BY ME BUT BAD FOR THEM\n\nWHAT WITH THE F@#$ING English WHY THE HELL MUST ALL THE CREDITS BE IN English 95% OF THE PEOPLE IN THE THEATER CANNOT READ ENGISH AND 90 % CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT. WE HAD WORLDS LIKE ASTRONOMY, FUTURE, ISLAND, At least 25 DIFFERENT English WORDS. In the beginning of the movie Hritik breaks into an English monologue to show of the priyanka WHY THE F^%# CANT WE HAVE Hindi SUBTITLES my friend asked me what it meant. I could see the dazed look on the audiences faces Also I had a guy ask me what is the meaning of future, isn't bhavishya an understandable word.\n\nMust stop............review already to long must summon powers .........yes I've stopped more comments...on to the summary.\n\nMay not have been a great movie for me but who cares besides me. THE AUDIENCE IN BHAVANGAR LOVED IT.\n\nANY MOVIE THAT PLEASES IT TARGET AUDIENCE IS A GREAT FILM.\n\nWatch it if you love Hritik or if you share the tastes of the small city moviegoer.\n\n+'s a few good scenes including romantic ones, best graphics in Indian cinema, Priyanka Chopra, Naseeruddin Shah.\n\n+/-'s overdone, overbearing Hritik, overused graphics, inspired even original parts not exciting.\n\n-'s to much English including credits (more abusing), bad acting by the rest of the crew even Rekha looked straight out of a 70s film, ordinary songs especially in the second half.\n\nTotal 3.5/10 for me 10/10 for the public"

The plot is good and the evil bad guy is good. the plot had an unexpected twist that added to the movie. The girls, however, were definitely Bollywood \"blondes\"...they really didn't have to be that gorgeous and THAT stupid, did they? the first part of the movie really had some fun to it and was lighthearted and had wonderful scenery. the second part was also great, but didn't show enough of Singapore. this was all in all, a great sequel to Koi Mil Gaya."

        "review_detailed_main": "Krrish is the sequel to the 2003 Bollywood sci-fi film Koi Mil Gaya. If you didn't know that well now you do so go watch it to understand everything from this film, thou even without watching it you shouldn't be very lost to be honest.\n\nKrrish like it's predecessor has an amazing cast with the addition of Priyanka Chopra as Krrish's love interest. Hritik Roshan once again does a superb job portraying both Rohit and Rohit's son Krrish. Priyanka does a similarly good job at her character Priya. Priya is nothing like Nisha as while being very beautiful(it's Priyanka Chopra/Mrs World after all) she is rather easily influenced by her friend Honey, to use Krrish's feelings for her in order to drag him to Singapore to act in their television series and save their careers at the same time. While that sounds horrible it does get better as Priya slowly starts to fall for Krrish, she eventually realizes this and tells Honey that she now has real legitimate feelings for Krrish. Unfortunately Krrish has already walked off after hearing the first bit of the conversation where they mention having used his feelings for her to rescue their jobs. Don't worry though as Priya ends up fixing up the mistakes she made and everything turns out good in the end. All in all each actor did a splendid job playing their respective characters!\n\nNow for storyline, the storyline continues from where Koi Mil Gaya's ends but a couple years later (the in between time is covered at the start of the film by the narrator) after Nisha(Preity Zinta) has unfortunately passed away to due heartbreak at believing her husband Rohit lost. Rohit's mother Sonia Mehra(Rekha) is left raising Rohit's and Nisha's son Krrish. Unlike his father Krrish is born very smart and capable of incredible physical feats due to Jadoo's powers being passed down from Rohit to him. Sonia try's to hide him away from the world but it only works for so long... let me not say anymore before I spoil it but all in all a brilliantly continued storyline that will captivate the watcher and leave them wanting more. (A lot of reviewers have said there is not enough action/superhero scenes but remember this film is more a start of his superhero character/an origin story, plus a romance.)\n\nNow onto the special effects, they were perfect for the film and fit the style of the movie as well as the characters without overdoing it and making the film just a bunch of flashy special effects one after another. The way Rajesh Roshan has done it is perfectly suited to the movie and film series.\n\nFinally to the music and dance scenes, it wouldn't be a Bollywood film without these. But while many Bollywood movies have songs that aren't so great or scenes that add nothing to the film, Krrish's dance scenes are all amazingly choreographed and continue the telling of the story and the characters. The songs themselves are all really great and afterwards had me rewinding just to replay and listen to some of the songs again!\n\nTo wrap things off, this is a really well done film with an amazing cast, special effects, songs and dances and accomplishes everything it set out to accomplish.\n\nA well earned 10/10 from me!"

And its not until mosty of the film has passed that you get to see some serious action. Enter the villain of the story. and a whole Matrix style plot evolves. Pryanka's acting is average and annoying at times. Hritik is fairly OK and Rekha is the only one that really shines out. Nasserudin's villain is a bit too comical at times and could have been done better no where near the frightening mogambo of Mr India (played by the great Amrish Puri) All in all not bad but nothing to shout about average sequel."

Some parts were so corny that gave me goosebumps.

However, this one advantage has not been put to use by the makers of Krrish. Though a sequel to Koi Mil Gaya, it tries to begin a new on several fronts and the lame screenplay never really gets off the ground, except towards the last 15-20 minutes of the film, and by then it's too late.\n\nWhat Koi Mil Gaya was to ET meets Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Krrish is to Superman meets Spiderman (with some Matrix action thrown in). But Koi Mil Gaya was an extremely well crafted entertainer with a crackerjack screenplay and deft direction by Rakesh Roshan, breaking the conventional hero mould and establishing that a great performance which is not necessarily heroic in true Indian tradition (but has heroism written all over in terms of originality and clever inspiration from other successful works) is bound to work. Krrish is not what one would expect from the same maker. It's not even a patch on the prequel, and wastes away valuable screen time establishing itself and its eponymous hero. Yes, this is a superhero film, and yes, some action sequences have a Matrix hangover and the special effects are worthy, well executed by any set world standard, but it's the writing which is very poor and lets the entire film down.\n\nKrrish does not match up to the prequel nor does it live up to the huge hype which has been created."

That may sound like a no-duh-ism, but I think some of you may go thinking, \" Well, this is really a super-hero movie with some songs in it.\". Sorry. It's not quite like that. The music in Krrish is its very skeleton and if you just don't dig that kind of thing, the meat hanging off of it is just not going to be enough for you. Maybe you should just go see Superman Returns...but I thought it sucked, so don't come asking me for a refund. Besides, if Peter Parker started singing and dancing you'd hate Spiderman too...\n\nDo you love Bollywood films? Then I think Krrish just might be your kind of movie. It has truly great songs by Rajesh Roshan; some of the best Bollywood songs ever. Amazing singing and dancing in creative musical sequences with fabulous cinematography and great sprinkles of special effects magic. Krrish is packed to the brim with all of the flowers, romance and warm fuzzy feelings that accompany the greatest Indian films. If you like Koi Mil Gaya you must see this. Its a great follow up and there's some amazing surprises and twists waiting for you...\n\nHave you never seen a Bollywood film? or have you seen Bollywood films and were not so sure about them? Go see this movie. You've never seen a Bollywood film? WIth all this talk of flowers and dancing would you be surprised if I told you Krrish is a super-hero movie with a very serious tone and some shockingly dark twists? It is. The juxtaposition of the sweet video-like song sequences with the frenetic wire-fu leaping and bum-kicking of the action sequences is really quite entertaining. You've seen Bollywood films but were not too sure how to feel about them? Krrish is wonderfully Indian, but more accessible to western audiences than some Bollywood films. While it is 3 1/2 hours long it moves at a brisk pace. The music and action sequences are perfectly placed within the film to create a whooshing flow. The fight scenes are really brilliant and considering Superman Returns had zero fight scenes Krrish is the place you will want to go for some bone jarring, villain juggling, super powered fists of fury this summer!"

        "review_detailed_main": "A runaway hit in India, where its homegrown title superhero \"Krrish\" will likely out-gross the much-touted \"Superman Returns\" import, Rakesh Roshan's sequel to his madly successful sci-fi extravaganza \"Koi ... mil gaya\" pilfers \"ideas\" from multiple Hollywood comicbook sagas with beaming insouciance. Not content to walk on water, swing through forests at supersonic speed, and demolish a cricket field with a single ball, Krishna (reigning heartthrob Hrithik Roshan) also sings and dances divinely as romance decidedly trumps deeds of derring-do for most of the pic's 172 minutes. Enjoyable, daffily improbable escapist romp further expands Bollywood's pop genre repertoire.\n\nFearing the discovery and exploitation of her very \"special\" young grandson Krishna, Sonia (Rekha) whisks the boy off to the hinterlands. There, the plump little geek develops into a gorgeous hunk who communes with animals and smiles contentedly at all creation. When a beautiful career woman named Priya (Priyanka Chopra) drops, Jane-like, into his life via a parachute, Krishna disappears into the trees to play childish tricks on her and her friends, occasioning numerous duets as the couple frolics through the jungle.\n\nBut Priya works for a media company, and, when her job is threatened, she lures Krishna to Singapore, ostensibly to meet her mother but in reality to peddle her newfound \"superboy\" discovery. Before he goes, however, Sonia tells Krishna that his father was betrayed by an evil scientist, triggering flashbacks to \"Koi ... mil gaya\" and to Krishna's dad, who looks exactly like him (not too surprisingly, since Hrithik played his progenitor in the previous film).\n\nKrishna promises his grandmother that he'll hide his extraordinary lights under a bushel. Not until more than half-way through the film does Krishna's alter-ego, Krrish, finally materialize, his zigzag half-mask and shiny black coat disguising him even less effectively than Clark Kent's dorky homburg and glasses. After a big musical number, a three-ring Bombay circus showstopper, Krrish appears on cue to save children trapped in a burning tent -- performing a death-defying rescue that may be the only thing that could top the just-wrapped song.\n\nThesping is engaging, aside from Miss World 2000 Chopra's vapid posing (though, to be fair, it is hard to maintain any tonal continuity while changing costumes more frequently than one changes expressions). Rekha brings depth to her role as the nurturing grandmother, and Naseeruddin Shah, as the power-mad corporate scientist Dr. Arya, has great fun chewing up the futuristic scenery."

He falls in love with a tourist girl, Priya. After some 40 minutes of time waste, she goes back to her place(Singapore). She calls him and asks him to come there. After a heated argument, he convinces her. We are told of his past then. The story starts only in the second half. Still there's just a bit of plotline, almost non existent.\n\nStunts were wierd. Not saying they were bad, but unusual. The superpowers of Krishna will put Hollywood superheroes to shame. Whatever he touches turns powerful, that's the only way you can explain how the volleyball he hit cracked a rock.\n\nHritik is a good actor. He was 32 when he did Krrish but he brilliantly captured the innocence of a 20 year old boy. But he whispers a lot. Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah supported brilliantly. Priyanka chopra is diassapointing and Manini Mishra overacted. Hemant pandey is good in his brief role. But everyone is monotonous throughout the film. Also, except Krishna, no character is given any depth.\n\nThere isn't anything in it which we haven't seen a hundred times before. Why would I advice someone to watch it?"

The movie has Action, Comedy, Romance which is a little longer then needed and family drama with revenge. Hritek has given a good performance as usual, Koi Mil Gaya role was more challenging. The Beautiful Priyanka Chopra looks very sexy as usual and delivers a good performance.

        "review_detailed_main": "Who better than Hrithik Roshan to attain the honor of giving India it's first superhero? It clearly shows that Hrithik put in his 200% into this film whether it be his death-defying stunts across the skyscrapers of Singapore, his superb acting, or his superhero physique. You'd think the Roshans couldn't come up with a better storyline than the original, but think again! Krrish has just as intense and moving a story as Koi Mil Gaya. Apart from the breathtaking action, the story has strong emotions and themes making it all the more enjoyable. Where Hollywood superhero movies like Batman, Spiderman, and Superman have villains with an odd, powerful physical strength, Krrish's villain has a power of a different dimension--time. Powerful emotions and an intelligently written script set Krrish apart from your typical Hollywood superhero flick. Priyanka was extremely disappointing and irritating for the first time. Songs are lame."

He is always underestimated by many people but he is more talented than khans of Bollywood and if he does not get Oscars for this movie, it will be ignorance of talent by the world. Watch the movie his actions, his emotions and his acting and dancing skills all Superb even Hollywood Superman can't match his standards. ANd another great thing is some actions he has performed himself and not through computer generated images, only due to him the movie is a super hit blockbuster in India and abroad."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a long-time Superman fan, not South Asian, and loved this movie. It is good both within Bollywood standards as well as on its own in terms of introducing a new concept in Indian cinema. I agree with Effulgent-Warrior's comment's 100% -- to compare it to other genres of movies would be a mistake. In and of itself, it combines a good story, excellent cinematography, solid visual effects, wonderful music and an incredible performance by Hrithik Roshan.\n\nI went into this movie with absolutely no idea of who Hrithik Roshan was or any knowledge of the movie's background (other than that it was about an Indian superhero), and was blown away. The standards are incredibly high across the board, it's a great plot, the performances are solid, and it's a very entertaining experience overall. To dissect it against American standards would be a big mistake. If there's one thing that bothered me it was the blatant product placement, but I know that's a Bollywood standard as much as the music and almost 3 hour length!\n\nHrithik Roshan could easily have a distinguished career in the U.S., able to go up against any American or British action actor in my opinion. He's that good.\n\nIn summary, this is a first-rate film that deserves to be watched. I can't wait for Krrish 2."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must have read about 10 reviews so far in three days and I do not understand the reason for the gloom. I went to watch Krrish after reading a scathing review and I was so surprised! The problem lies in the expectations. Why would you go for Krrish expecting to see Hollywood style special effects? And more pertinent a question is why should you compare? Granted that we in India get to watch movies like M:I:3 and X-Men 3 as soon as they release in the West, must not we realize that taking to such movies and making such movies is a whole lot different? And in comparison, Krrish has more emotional reach than either of the above sequels managed. So I think its a good balance. Hollywood uses its studio power to spend millions on special effects, Indian films don't have that kind of money - exactly the reason why they attempt to tug at your emotions...\n\nYes I loved Krrish.\n\nIts the story of the son of Rohit Mehra, the mentally challenged kid in Koi Mil Gaya, who receives powers from an alien called Jadoo. When the movie opens, Rohit and his wife are dead and their Krishna is a precocious five year old. He is too mature and intelligent for his age. Afraid what to make of this, his grandmother (Rekha) takes him far away to Manali and home schools him. Krishna is friendless. In the absence of human friends, he grows up with nature and has a rapport with its beings.\n\nEnter Priya. Its a case of love at first sight. After a few songs later, he follows her to Singapore where she is a reporter. There circumstances force him to reveal his powers. And consequently he gets embroiled with the bad scientist with the dream of ruling the world, Dr Arya.\n\nKrrish's romance is cute and innocent and the love angle is fresh. The action sequences, though they take a little time appearing on screen, when they appear they are mighty good, for a first attempt at this genre of movie-making. Hrithik Roshan showcases his intensity and screen presence. Even in aggressive moves, he is elegant. He is a fine actor. A pity that he shines only when his father directs him.\n\nPriyanka Chopra doesn't quite seem perfect for the role of Priya. Priya was a role that required someone who looked a bit more natural and wilder. Chopra looks a sophisticate without any rebelliousness in her. Someone like Parveen Babi or Zeenat Aman would have chewed up this role. Rekha as the grandmother doesn't have much to do this time, other than look concerned and sad.\n\nThe background music is good in bursts...there is no consistency. A really good background score would have been an asset. The music is quite old style.\n\nYou must watch this movie without any background clutter of Spidey movies, Batmobile, M:I series and other SFX movies. Be fair, for the west had access to this technology decades before us, even the Chinese are far ahead. Let our film makers come to terms with this (its a toy for them now) only then will they be hungry to get the best of it."

        "review_detailed_main": "When you watch Krrish, you deeply feel the passion, effort and honesty the father-son team invested in the film. Over two years in the making, Krrish is indeed the fruit of labor that manages to reap the sweetness and some true spellbinding moments for its viewers too. The movie is finely structured so that there is no conflict with its prequel 'Koi Mil Gaya' and runs with a fine pace, barring the songs that are a big dampener compared to earlier two Hrithik films, including the mega one 'Kaho Na Pyar Hai'. The director Rakesh Roshan should be applauded for not getting carried away with fatherly love, lest it jeopardize other crucial characters that push the story forward. Priyanka Chopra has a meaty role of almost a parallel length with the superboy. Rekha had her screen moments too. Naseeruddin Shah as the bad man has a good entry point and animating short & crisp monologues of a notorious newsreader. Preity Zinta is surely missed but her exclusion was perhaps essential for the sequel and likewise for the friendly alien 'Jadu'. Once again, the screenplay is skillfully penned by a brigade of writers including Rakesh Roshan and Honey Irani to name a few. Hrithik- Priyanka introduction scene is one of the most stirring love-scenes in the present Hindi cinema, rendered with innocence and 'love is in the air' magical moments. The comedy in the first half is not brash but rather the one with connectivity at the grass roots with the flavor of modernism. The stunts are awe-inspiring and antithesis to pre-release film speculations of a hybrid between a Superman and Spiderman. The expected flights are replaced by giant grasshopper leaps over skyscrapers and the clich\u00e9d cape is also dropped for a reversible black long cloak; not very impressive, but effective. The cinematography is top notch capturing Kullu Manali and Singapore in exciting and adventurous frames as the playground for our superhero, who is also the man of the moment; Hrithik Roshan. The overnight superstar of 'Kaho Na Pyar Hai' has once again warranted his stardom amongst the equals a.k.a. the Khans. A sane head over strong shoulders, jutting almost superhuman jumbo biceps, the man of steel has put tantamount pains in his character portrayal projected with realism and conviction. Why watch Krrish? In a nutshell, Hrithik Roshan! But to give devil his due, watch Krrish because it boasts of great acting, tight screenplay, seductive cinematography, enthralling stunts, effective story telling, bull's-eye direction and because you loved 'Koi Mil Gaya' and Hindi Cinema is ready for sequels! Phir Hera Pheri, Darna Zaroori Hai\u0085many more to follow"

Krrish will be enjoyed by kids and family audiences because of no vulgar scenes. Though Hollywood is just mimicking most of the scripts from Hollywood, the existence of Indian culture hasn't completely vanished away. This is why most NRI and other Asian audiences tend to like a movie like this. As a matter of fact, the stunts of Hritik might influence the children as most children did after watching \"shaktimaan\". The hard work of Rakesh Roshan is seen by the strong character such as Krishna (hritik) and Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah). These two characters are like a spirit of this movie. The rest character is well on their places."

This is a sequel to Rakesh Roshan's Koi Mil Gaya... This movie shows us what happens to Rohit (Hrithik in Koi Mil Gaya) after the alien Jadoo leaves bestowing powers to him. The young Hrithik(Krishna) is grown in a remote village due to Rekha's fear of losing grandson due to his gifted strengths and power which passed on from his father, Rekha's son. Priyanka entrance. After a little romance/drama he visits Singapore to bring the heroine back to India. He vows to his grandma that he will not use his powers and get recognized. But circumstances compel him to do so and Krishna becomes Krrish. Rest is all about the super-human stunts and high-tech computer labs and eventually an expected finish with the death of the bad guy. This is an awesome movie for Hrithik fans and kids. Bollywood has made a strong entry into super-human films. This film will not let anyone down except for music lovers who like simply watching songs. Songs do not appeal the first time but couple of the numbers are actually good. Kudos to the Roshans for making Krrish. People who have seen Superman, Spiderman, Pay check, Minority report will have a deja vu feeling but at the same time it is wrong of us to expect a complete original film in an era where a new film is released every day."

I would recommend those people to make a movie first and then understand how difficult it is..... All directors cannot be steven spielbergs and I think Rakesh Roshan has done a good job .

So as Rajesh Roshan He was also best. His direction was perfect and to the task. It is quite difficult to make a movie in which a child aged 6 years to a man aged 60 years can sit together and view it. Just Perfect and Fabulous.

The film is superb in its genre, particularly in the context of Bollywood which is having its first Super Hero film. Hrithik is unbelievable, story does not have loose ends and Naseer adds class to the film. The film is fun, engaging and stunts fit well in the story. Good work by Rakesh & Hrithik."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was very well done and the songs and dances were amazing! Hrithik Roshan is such a loose dancer! So Flexible. But Priyanka Chopra disappointed me. Her role was just like every other superhero's lover role, helpless and and over acter, and overreactor. She shouldn't have been in the role. I don't blame her for the acting she did. It's the script writers that need to be blamed. She doesn't deserve to be blamed at all. But she could have made suggestions and not stood back. The best role was played by Nasserudin Shah for his villainous role as the power crazy, time maniac. He really scared me when he did his \"breaking news\" quotes. He just seemed so calm yet violent. He acted like Nana Patekar. He just scared the heck out of me, but at the same time, he would just stay calm and just say, \" That's true if he's gone, how will I ever control time?\" He is just about the scariest villain I've seen, next to Amrish Puri. All in all, the movie was good, but, sadly, not better than the prequel."

And the other thing that makes me crazy is that Krrish was a very fantastic film and overall I had seen it two times in cinema even though it cost $10 per ticket , I tell you it's more than worth it...Now, I'll always watch the DVD...I'll be able and don't mind watching it a million times again and again... Hrithik really acted out that character very wonderfully and is the first Indian Super Hero... He really makes a Blast off performances in all the songs. I believe that Hrithik had done a brilliant job and this movie is a Biggest Blockbuster Movie. I really hope and pray that this movie will win. Even though,there are some negatives mind set peoples out there,whatever BUT overall...The truth and the fact is that Krrish is the BIGGEST BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE...I wish Hrithik Roshan and Rakesh Roshan , All The Best... And for the people around the world...Krrish is a movie that u can't miss out...It's a WASTE WHO NEVER WATCH IT..."

Starring Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra, Naseeruddin Shah, Rekha, Manini Mishra, Archana Puran Singh and Sharat Saxena, this movie portrayed the best storytelling of a superhero. A second installment of Koi mil Gaya, is a complete package of action, thrill and mystery. The charming chemistry of Hrithik and Priyanka is not disappointing.

This film has the potential to imagine and think out-of-the-box. The big budget movie is an excellent and intriguing plot which has the powerful ability to leave an indelible mark on the watchers. Before watching movie, take a look at the synopsis to make a fair decision.\n\nBelow is the synopsis.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nKrishna (Hrithik Roshan) was endowed by his father with magical abilities at birth.

Dr. Arya is the only person standing between him and his dangerous fantasies.\n\nSongs:\n\nThe music composer Rajesh Roshan has given the future generation an all-time chartbuster hit song. From Dil Na Diya to Pyaar ki Kahaani, all the songs are timeless priceless gifts for everyone to sing and dance.\n\nThe melodious voices of Shreya Ghoshal, Sonu Nigam, Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik and Rafaqat Ali will force you to add all the songs in your along playlist. The calming and emotional lyrics of the songs can refresh your moods.\n\nActing performance\n\nThe acting of all the actors and actresses are flawless and commendable.

        "review_detailed_main": "Krrish is neither as bad as some people claim through simple and generic nitpicks nor as good as some people hype it up. But the movie is good enough to be enjoyable throughout its entire running length. Krrish is a very light hearted movie that one can see with his family and not take too seriously. The story is easily predictable. They might have ripped off too many Hollywood movies and may have also flooded the scenes with different sponsor brand names but despite all those flaws, there is a lot of enjoyable content. Hrithik Roshan's acting is never to be doubted, especially after Lakshya (this movie is no lakshya though) and he does deliver a superb performance. Just don't go expecting something ground breaking because it is not, even though it may be a landmark by Bollywood standards."

Yes, it has a lot of silly mistakes, but that doesn't take away the fact that it's one of the best superhero movies ever made.\n\nEven its sequel couldn't touch its legacy, I don't think any other Indian movie will.\n\nI absolutely love this movie and it deserves all the success it has got, especially in the time of its release!"

And who says music is not that great, songs are so melodious and again the picturization was too good. One can easily watch this movie mulitple times just to see Hrithik and his super hero style. Some of the stunts like jumping over the river,monkeying between the trees fighting with Chinese mafia were awesome. Rekha's makeup was over board to make her look older. which was unnecessary. Amazingly, Priyanka Chopra manages to look okay with Hrithik. Other actors and Naserudin were good. In the first part there is a old filmi style comedy, which some how appeals. There is a comedy, emotions, love, values and an awesome and clean entertainment for the whole family."

Only after watching the film they realized that.\n\nKrrish was an instant hit not only because it was a sequel to an already superhit film, but the fact that Indian audience got to witness probably its first proper looking superhero film on the big screen. The plot was also believable considering it inherits from its prequel hence krishna's powers were quite well justified."

I haven't laughed so much in my life, and I don't mean that in a negative way. Myself, my friends and the several hundred Koreans there, were in absolute hysterics from beginning to end. I am sure that it wasn't the directors intention to make us laugh, but laugh we did and I thank him for it.\n\nThe Korean audience were applauding the fight sequences and at the end of the movie, there was a huge cheer and round of genuine applause for a really entertaining night.\n\nGreat stuff...go and see it."

(i'm trying not to spoil the story here).\n\noverall, i'd say the last 45 minutes or so was the best part of the movie, when it got more into what he had to do and away from the lovey dovey stuff which, considering the characters they wrote for those girls, was extremely disappointing and given the heightened intelligence Krishna is supposed to be endowed with, almost unbelievable.\n\ni'm glad i saw it and came away with a new respect for hrithik as an actor..\n\ni do think the cover shots for the DVD and the movie menu might have been partly inspired by takeshi kaneshiro in \"Returner\"...anyone else know what i'm talking about?!"

It was amazing and if you are a person that watch the movie just for graphics, then this movie exceeds expectation. The fight scenes are well prepared, the singing were in context and not just a bunch of people singing and dancing around trees for now reason.\n\nI love the blend of cultures in this movie and I love the way Krrish was a superhero but at the same time, he is human. He is NOTHING like Superman or any of the English superhero that I grew up with. Krrish is more of the people's hero.\n\nAgain this movie was a great watch and I think after sending this, I really should watch it again.\n\nCheers all! K"
