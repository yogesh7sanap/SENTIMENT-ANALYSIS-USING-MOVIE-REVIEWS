        "review_detailed_main": "All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.\n\n\"Return of the King\" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.\n\nThe cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.\n\nNow that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.\n\nA masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nMy only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.\n\nDespite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.\n\nThe score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.\n\nThe acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.\n\nAll in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.\n\nAt this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.\n\nThis is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.\n\nThese were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.\n\nSorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.\n\nMy rating: 10/10"

In part two, there was action, battles and magnificent special effects.\n\nBut what does part 3 have? More of the same. It had to be made, to complete the story and Peter Jackson did a great job. But especially the last hour was almost boring. After the twentieth happy-ending-swelling-music-scene, I was almost begging for the end. Still, I loved it, but maybe that was more because of the first two movies, or because of the book....."

I have not studied \"The Lord of the Rings\" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.\n\nI can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of."

The cast are superb (if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain), the cinematography stunning and the pace, even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books (as I have for many years) I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure, wonderous, unadulterated piece of epic, EPIC cinema. I'm sure I will love it forever."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.\n\nWe all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise.\n\nThat all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created.\n\nThe 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words.\n\nIf one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out).\n\nAs a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson."

But that is mostly due to the great special effects .\n\nThe point i rated this movie a 7 is because of the stupid story mistakes Peter putted in his movie. Especially the ghost army is a huge, huge mistake. Everybody who readed the book knows the ghost army does not take part in the huge fight, but only conquers the pirate's fleet, so Aragorn and his men can sail to the battle. The orcs think they get some backup when they see the black sails, but then are overrun by Aragorn, not the ghosts.\n\nLike the thing above there are more things which i do not like. Like the snowboarding Legolas in the battle for Helm's Deep (not this movie, but still). Legolas is indeed quite handy on his feet, but snowboarding on a shield?\n\nThese are just the things which made me personally think Peter could have come up with a much better movie of one of the best story's ever written."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been an avid LOTR fan for almost ten years now. I love love love love the books, but I really hated this movie.\n\nWhat Jackson did (and I'm surprised Phillipa or Christopher didn't call him out on it) was cut all the really important ending bits for sake of having disgustingly overblown battle sequences that made me want to kill myself. An hour is too long to be in battle, in a movie, I'm sorry. The CGI was amazing, and the deaths were good and all, but it didn't really help the story along. All it did was sit there. And we aren't even going to get into how much I hate Orlando Bloom.\n\nThe fact that the scenes in the houses of healing were cut just pisses me off. Faramire and Eowyn deserved more than a glance during Aragorn's OMG SPIFFY coronation. They were the the link between Gondor and Rohan. They were actually quite major characters, and they were totally glossed over for the sake of some Oliphants falling over. Butchery? Yes, yes it is.\n\nAnd the endings. The endings weren't long enough. I know what you're thinking, \"but... the ending dragged on and on with no sign of an end in sight until it actually ended\", but seriously folks, don't give me that BS unless you've read the books as many times as I have (if you have, then by all means, give me that BS many people have read them more times then I have, but those people would agree with me) when Peter Jackson decided to use his \"artistic\" license to completely forget about half of the stuff in the books, he cheated people out of some seriously amazing story telling. The scouring of the Shire is what the whole trilogy is supposed to be about. It's about how Frodo leaves hating how much the hobbits take for granted in life, and then coming back, and helping to save them from something they have never before had the displeasure of meeting, and that is slavery. And then when they won their freedom back, they loved their heroes, and they celebrated them, and they were happy again, and they (hopefully) wouldn't take so much for granted again in the future.\n\nOkay, I'm getting myself upset, and I'll shut up. But seriously, all this movie is for is watching people run around and stab things. Not interesting to me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit \"Chronological\" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.\n\nWhich of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood \u0096 and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.\n\nFrodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.\n\nThe heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.\n\nThe casting and acting are superb.\n\nThe film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.\n\nReturn of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism \u0096 both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.\n\nEven more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK."

        "review_detailed_main": "Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.\n\nReturn of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.\n\nThe storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.\n\nThis is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)\n\nThe worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . ."

The acting as it has been is brilliant again. Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers.\n\nAs I said, the acting is again first rate from the entire cast. And it was nice to see Andy Serkis getting his face on screen as Smeagol, before his transformation into Gollum.\n\nBy the end of the movie, there were more than a few tears as the boat left the Grey Havens, as the movie ended on a quiet emotional note, after the epic battles before.\n\nI could happily have sat through this again and again. Well done to everyone, both in front and behind the cameras for such a brilliant work, but of course special mention has to go to Peter Jackson. He deserves every award he's received for this.\n\nOne last point. If you only seen the theatrical release, then go get the extended version of this film. It's even better!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and certainly doesn't disappoint like some other trilogies *coughMatrixcough*. The three films had their principal shooting all done at the same time, which lowers their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the films.\n\nThe special effects, first of all, are excellent. While there's a few little things (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and occasional lighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or simple scene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with filmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on DVD, there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive screen.\n\nThe filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital smoothing and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer. There are a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on, getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are some beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are quite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to look into real estate purchases now.\n\nSound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any production. This is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound appropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering on painful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and it's rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof of the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard Shore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the series.\n\nPerformances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles perfectly, and came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed to be stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of the movie, almost Max Payne-style, and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen, the ever-wise white wizard, had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered well; my only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings leading to scene changes. Orlando Bloom, favorite of young teenage girls everywhere, had a few more action sequences (which got cheers from the aforementioned girls) which were quite well pulled off, but his acting wasn't much tested by this film. John Rhys-Davies continued with Gimli's joking performance; he's really too amusing to take seriously, but does a good job at it.\n\nFor the old Tolkien fans, this movie stays quite close to the book, although they did have to omit some portions, most notably the taking and retaking of the Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith. Hopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD. Shelob's attack was left until this film, and much of the time spent in Mordor was shortened for the sake of pacing, and it was a good decision.\n\nMy favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The incredible scope of the battle, with the special effects, sounds, and many close-ups of pieces of the action, make for an exciting scene. The visual effects especially are stunning; the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the action, and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide shots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field of battle, and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a backdrop. It's worth your movie-going dollar simply to watch this on a large screen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas Tirith, so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene, and it keeps it from being dreary or heavy-handed.\n\nOverall, this is a movie well worth watching, and even paying to see in a theatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children, as there are some scary images, and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in what will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly great date movie, either...this is a real, bring-your-friends big movie. Five out of five decapitated orcs (and trust me, there were a lot more than that)."

Peter Jackson took on the most demanding project imaginable and created a series that will be remembered forever. He respected Tolkien's literature and stuck so incredibly close to the source material and translated it so effortlessly in such grand fashion. I highly recommend the extended editions, as they devote more time to building Middle Earth and developing their incredible characters ever further. 20 years later and the series still looks incredible, especially in 4K. What Jackson did here could never be replicated; he created the best trilogy ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Man, and you thought Titanic was cheesy?! When I first saw this film on the big screen, the multiple endings bothered me only a little. Now that I saw it for the second time, they simply outraged me. Best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture of the year all went this way. This time: not deserved. The Return of the King ends five times. FIVE TIMES!! I don't give a good goddamn if it was that way in the books too. I never read them. And that gives me a good position to rate this as a film and not a screen adaptation.\n\nEvery single time Elijah Wood laughs in this movie (in the entire trilogy actually), I almost throw up. Couldn't they make it any more cheesier?! Especially stomach turning is the scene at the end of the RotK, where they all laugh and hug by Frodo's bed. OF COURSE in slow motion to add a little more sappiness. Plus the scene where their journey has ended and they all sit in the pub and sk\u00e5l their pints together.. check out the expression on Wood's face. So cheesy I laughed my a** off.\n\nThe most worrying thing about all of this is that without the cheesiness and the multiple endings, this would've really been a great movie. I don't love them, but I do like these films. And it was such a tasteless display of drama from the academy to pretty much dismiss the two previous movies and award the last and most tasteless one in spades. It made the whole thing feel like the \"Russell Crowe-syndrome\", as I like to call it. They didn't award him the statue for The Insider, but instead for Gladiator the next year, because they probably felt so guilty. Maximus after all was clearly a more easier role than Wigand and didn't deserve the award as much.\n\nI can see why so many love this film and embrace it, but people, eleven Oscars? No.\n\n** / *****"

        "review_title": "Shocked by disappointment",
        "review_detailed_main": "I loved the first two LOTR films, and was keyed up almost beyond endurance to see ROTK the first week it opened. When the film was over, I was stunned by the depth of disappointment I was feeling. In fact, I went back and watched the movie again a few days later; I could not believe that it really had been as bad as I'd experienced. The fault must have been mine, I thought; I'd been too wound up to really take it in. With a cooler head, I'd be able to enjoy it and the magic would work again, as it had with the previous two movies. Alas, no. The movie was just as bad as I'd thought, and it somehow managed to posthumously poison my pleasure in the other two movies as well. I've never been able to enjoy any of them since.\n\nI came to really hate Peter Jackson, especially after watching all the \"making of\" interviews on the dvds. I believe he is an undisciplined, self-indulgent egomaniac, and these characteristics progressively took over as the film series continued. Fellowship of the Ring was the best of the lot, and I feel it's because it was a gamble. Now that the series is over, people forget that before FOTR premiered, there was no guarantee that the film would be a success. LOTR was a notoriously difficult book to adapt, and many worried that it couldn't be done. In that atmosphere, Jackson and his co-writers were at their most deferential to the original Tolkien text, and almost humble in their approach to such a daunting task.\n\nAfter FOTR was a big success, they became more confident in their own skills, and felt bold enough to try a little rewriting for The Two Towers, even while assuring fans that it was only a little strategic reorganizing, and the original story would be preserved in ROTK. By that point, however, Jackson was so deluded by the sycophantic flattery that surrounded him on all sides, he was convinced that the fans would adoringly accept anything he filmed, simply because it was the product of such a genius. ROTK could not contain both Tolkien's story and Jackson's ego, and guess which won in the end? The story flopped all over the place, with Saruman's storyline simply chopped off and left unresolved, while Jackson wasted time indulging in invented scenes back in Rohan, when the story should have moved decisively to Gondor. That, however, was not the part of the story that interested him, so we had to have more loving photography of carved dark wood beams and animal-skin rugs, plus a vastly overdrawn love connection between Eowyn and Aragorn. When Jackson finally had to tear himself away from this romantic Viking paradise and turn to Gondor, he revenged himself on the story by turning Gondor into a sterile, dead cement city, full of cowards and idiots.\n\nWorst of all, I felt that by ROTK Jackson was even getting sloppy on what had been a trademark of the films until then - set design and scale. For a scene where Gandalf and Pippin are on a balcony, looking towards Minas Morgul, he had both actors on the same set, with Pippin merely kneeling at the balcony, while Gandalf towered over him. However, the brain can quite clearly calculate that the scale of the balcony in relation to the bodies of both characters is wrong - in FOTR, Jackson would have built a larger-scale model of the balcony for Pippin, to keep up the illusion that he was a smaller figure in a setting made for people of Gandalf's size. This time, he couldn't be bothered, as if he felt that he'd paid his dues being accurate in the first two movies, and now he should be free to play around and have fun.\n\nThat was amply demonstrated with the stupid green goblins, the endless battle scenes, the noise, the shaking camera, and the labored \"humour\" in every Gimli scene. What annoyed me the most, however, was that Jackson seemed to have no grasp of what Tolkien thought was important. In the movie, only the \"stars\" are able to act (and yes, that includes the Hobbits), whereas Tolkien showed that nobility, courage and heroism are EVERYONE's business. In the books, the individual soldiers of Gondor had personalities, felt connected to the greater cause, and debated how best they could do their duty. In Jackson's movies, Aragorn and Gandalf do all the fighting, while crowds of women blubber helplessly and soldiers blunder about uselessly. This is why his removal of the Scouring of the Shire was both execrable and inevitable. Jackson can't recognize any drama in ordinary people in ordinary settings facing crisis and either failing or rising to the occasion - to him, the Shire is just dumb peasants who were too stupid not to leave home for adventure, and there's nothing more to be expected of them. Tolkien's whole theme was that adventure and crisis are NOT the sole property of noble heroes, but that it can touch anyone, and how we react when it does is as important as Aragorn's struggle with Sauron or Denethor's descent into madness."

There have never been motion pictures of the magnitude undertaken by co-writer/director Peter Jackson and his production team. The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy will endure forever as one of the most bold and audacious enterprises in the history of cinema. It is, quite simply, a seminal event. Other projects (for example, a movie filmed in space) are already being considered and may someday be attempted. They may challenge LOTR's logistical complexities (or, at the very least, present a comparable set of obstacles), but it is unlikely the numbers of people involved or the sheer duration of the creative process will ever equal this effort.\n\nJackson & Company have made believers out of millions of readers who doubted the works would ever enjoy respectable translation into a more \"mainstream\" media. They have changed the way production models are approached for large-scale projects. They have forged what may well be the premiere visual effects house in the business (WETA Digital). They have raised the bar for all filmmakers to follow, and reminded millions of jaded moviegoers of one simple truth: Love, attention, and genuine dedication to (and appreciation of) one's material can overcome inconceivable obstacles, and always...always shows on-screen.\n\nAnd now it's over.\n\nWith the longest running time of any film in the cycle (early indications suggest next year's extended DVD cut will clock in at over 4 hours long), RotK is an all-out assault on the senses. There are times when it is simply impossible to take it all in: Armies of hundreds of thousands clash beneath towering war beasts as deadly, dragon-like bird-things strafe hapless victims on the ground. Mountainsides erupt with pyroclastic fury as lava flows labour to engulf our heroes. This film is off the hook, gloriously so.\n\nIn tone and \"feel\", RotK rests comfortably between Fellowship of the Ring's penchant for character-centric drama, and The Two Towers' colder, more mechanical \"war movie\" approach. What we end up with, is, in essence, an emotionally charged war movie sprawling in scale yet intimate in heart, its effects are frequently overpowering."

Of course opinions will vary wildly (and probably mostly contrary to mine), but for me this was just not sufficiently entertaining to justify its length. Well, the story is familiar, and that probably undermines the film for me (and I am not in awe of Tolkein's work anyhow), but just because Tolkein went over the top there was no need for Peter Jackson to follow. I would have probably liked the film better if it were not so long and repetitive (how many battle scenes can one watch before tiring of them). Sometimes more is less!"

After a while though my mind started to wander and after another hour I couldn't really care less about what happened to the characters.\n\nWhat is it that makes me so indifferent to these characters? I believe the whole thing boils down to Jackson's storytelling. At his best when he can wield his mighty camera over vast landscapes, showing off weird and wonderful creatures and humongous armies. He seems a lot less comfortable when dealing with human (hobbit, dwarfish, elfish) interaction on a smaller level. Unfortunately this somewhat spills over too the battle-scenes as well, and any enjoyment is purely on the visual side. Yes, the spectacle is certainly great - but it is still JUST spectacle.\n\nAnother problem is that the actors are for the most part delivering speeches rather than having conversations. It makes the whole thing stale and the characters less life-like.\n\nOn a positive note Jackson and his editors have improved the flow between the different story lines since the last film. The effects are mostly top-notch as is the production-design.\n\nUnfortunately it is let down by a director who seems to be bellowing, \"look what I can do\" to at all times. This \"more is more\"-style served him well in his earlier work but it's just a bit too shallow to do a justice to a story of this scale.\n\nAll in all not horrible, but certainly not the film to end all films...\n\n5/10"

        "review_title": "The problem with imagination",
        "review_detailed_main": "Overall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson, and movie fans alike in order to espouse the \"true\" value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good story-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures.\n\nThe problem with imagination is that it is an individual event, a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art, Fiction, Fantasy, and any degree of Story-telling agree (willingly or no) to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings, each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice, self-confidence, and faith (spiritual, one could argue) to thrust the contents of one's subjective reality into (to borrow from Douglas Adams) the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act, the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill O'Reilly, this concept of personal creation, what Tolkien called Sub-Creation, is the essence of modern human existence, and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us.\n\nTherefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have maligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right, with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for \"mediocre writing\" or \"atrocious film-making\" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions.\n\nTolkien was an enormously talented, intelligent, and imaginative man, one whose stories, though unpolished by experience, still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories and placed it in a visual medium, a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkien's story is imperfect; of course Jackson's movies aren't as full as we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage to capture our imagination, to move us, to take genuine truth and isolate it in a world outside our ken, a place where we see ourselves better against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so masterfully, with the intuitive grasp that is termed \"genius.\" Tolkien would have had much at issue with Jackson's movies, where plot incongruities, lapsed character development, and visual splendor overshadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book. Jackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book, including a lack of clear character motivation, extended and largely extraneous dialog, and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien, despite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of his book, would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation, for taking his modern-day mythology and spreading it to as many people as possible. Jackson has taken the beauty, the scope, the complexity, the richness, and the loss that permeate Middle-Earth and shared those leitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic \"niggling\" would have prevented any such attempt (even Jackson's), but in the end, his heritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films.\n\nI do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any other. Indeed, continue to express the direst and bleakest of your frustrations with the creative power of others, as it may lead you to actually do some creation yourself. Remember though, that the great evils of history, from Satan to Hitler to Sauron, are never capable of creation -- only twisting, mutilating, mocking, deforming, and misapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to offer, especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of Tolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the Secondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it.\n\nThis movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains incredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes (and yes, events may deviate in completely separate and dissimilar media) but it asks intelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own creation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic history to the sacrifice of Arwen and the never-completely-won nature of war, Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's tale, with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well. The world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude, as he has created another world and another reality that so many can, do, and will cherish.\n\nOne final word: There are few who would not rather be wandering in a far green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the World."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the last two Lord of the Rings films, the journey of so many heroes has come so far, and it all leads up to this. Darkness falls upon all of Middle-Earth. Huge armies of orcs march upon the kingdoms of men. The One Ring comes closer to its evil master. Could this be the end of the world, or the start of a new beginning? This final chapter in the film series starts off with an incredibly moving sequence: the heartbreaking tale of Gollum's origins. From the on, it picks right back up where the last films left off, chronicling the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they tread in dark and dangerous territory, combating orcs, one giant spider, and ultimately themselves as they approach the threshold of Mount Doom. At the same time, the film presents some of the biggest and most epic scenes ever committed to film: the Battle of Minas Tirith. It is a huge spectacle that fills up the entire screen with thousands and thousands of orcs, men, war machines, lumbering beasts, Nazg\u00fbl, cavalry, massive elephants, and even ghosts. It is a long struggle that fills up most of the movie's runtime, but it's always awe-inspiring. As if that's not enough, the film then brings the battle to the gates of Mordor, for one grand climax. Even in the calm before each battle, the film remains as captivating as its predecessors, thanks to its style and storytelling prowess. If there's anything to truly complain about, it would be the lengthy denouement. Overall, however, the experience of The Return of the King has never failed to invoke feelings of awe.\n\nAt this point, the characters of the film are well-established and intimately familiar, but the film does take its time to explore more of the familiar faces and elaborate on fresh new characters. They all come together to contribute to the multiple conflicts, tying every strand of the plot to one epic climax; it's a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant, and provides satisfying closure all around. Many liberties are taken from the original novels, but for the big screen, it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. Themes of war, corruption, addiction, good and evil, and adventure all prevail.\n\nAs before, this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. All the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles (especially Viggo Mortensen, who stands out more in this film than before, but it is always a pleasure to watch Ian McKellen as Gandalf, along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies). Writing is superb. This production boasts some excellent sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are huge; at its time, it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. Despite aging a bit, the effects are still impressive. Howard Shore's music score is as masterful as ever.\n\nReturn of the King delivers the best possible payoff for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (and it might even outshine the Hobbit saga in the end). Not only does it boast some of the biggest battles, but it is also a film with power and beauty. It has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites (was my number-one favorite for quite a few years), and the Lord of the Rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle, storytelling, and style.\n\nIf you watch the Extended Edition of this film, you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes, which offers a lot of excellent substance. Among the additions, there are longer battle scenes, a scene showing the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue, an extended encounter with the Army of the Dead, a parley with the Mouth of Sauron, and more. I think most of these scenes are really awesome, and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing.\n\n5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"

This is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. The plot is engaging from start to finish, and this moves rather smoothly, with great pacing. This is funny several times, and there is very little of the annoying(and still easily ignored) comic relief. I am thrilled to see Gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. The meld of live-action and CGI elements is perfect. You forget that not everything you're seeing is really there. The effects are impeccable, in general, and the imaginative designs, and boundless creativity are amazing. Creepy and dark, this isn't actually depressing, in spite of many gloomy moments. The battle sequences are intense, well-choreographed and awesome. This has astonishing editing and cinematography, and has a marvelous look. The acting doesn't let you down at any point. There is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this, and it might be too much for children. I recommend this to any fan of the fantasy genre, and, really, everyone who enjoys an appreciation for the medium of film. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lord of the Rings is without doubt the most epic and staggering film undertaking of all time. How Peter Jackson pulled it off I will never know, maybe he used one of Gandalf's enchantments! Rarely throughout the 12 hour epic is there a bad scene or a dull moment, every scene has had so much thought and hard work poured into it. From the writing, to the production crew, to the acting, to the scenery,to the music (oh god I love the music)and just everybody's determination to pull this near impossible feat off, even fantasy haters would have to admit their amazement. Never has a movie given me so many spine tingly moments and scenes of such beauty that they nearly push me to tears. Peter Jackson seemed so blessed with good fortune, (Viggo Mortensens' last minute replacement says it all), it was as if the spirit of Tolkien himself was guiding it along. As I see this as one whole movie, I won't be reviewing just 'The Return of the King'.\n\nI saw the first film 'The Fellowhip of the Ring' when I was 12, and I'm 21 now and I still haven't been more absorbed by a movie in the cinema and I doubt I ever will. The transition from the innocence and lightness of the Shire at the start to the dark epic of the quest later is nothing short of brilliant. I think 'Fellowship' is my favourite of the three, it goes through the most development and felt the most satisfying. The whole mines of Moria sequence is my standout moment of the entire trilogy. To the battle with the cave troll and the escape from the balrog, it is exhilarating, involving and most of all - emotional.\n\n'The Two Towers' has the hardest task of being the middle film, but it more than rises to the challenge. It drops you straight into the action and doesn't hold up. The Rohan sequences are the best bits of the film, culminating in the battle of helms deep which to me is the most personal and intense battle of the trilogy. The creation of Gollum was revolutionary, through CGI and motion capture never has a computerised character seemed so real.\n\n'The Return of the King' delivers the emotional finale we all hoped it would. I remember sitting in the cinema hearing all sorts of sobbing all around me during the climax on mount doom. There are so many stand-out moments in this movie but the one I will mention is the charge of the Rohirrim. This scene actually pushed me to tears on first viewing, not because it was sad but because it was so... awesome. I was so happy when this film won 11 Oscars, it more than deserved it, I was hoping it would win more than 11 but oh well.\n\nAny gripes I have for the trilogy, would be the portrayal of its big bad Sauron, and considering that Sauron is the centre of 'The Lord of the Rings' this is definitely a problem. If there was one thing from the books that is unfilmable it is definitely Sauron. How do you portray a villain that hardly appears and any descriptions of him there are, are so vague and surreal? Is Sauron a big flaming eye or did he have a physical form? This is never made clear in the books and poses a big obstacle for film, where the audience needs to see their villain. Peter Jackson and co do the best they can with the material, and chose to literally portray Sauron as the big flaming eye. However this is not enough to satisfy, especially during the climax of 'Return of the King' where the dark lord is basically a lighthouse! The films make the mistake of bigging Sauron up through the films, and ultimately it fizzles out by the end which is a real shame.\n\nAs you can tell from what I have said, I love 'The Lord of the Rings', and I would say it is my favourite film of all time. No other film has moved me as much as this and given me so many different emotions from fear, to sadness to laughter. I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else playing the characters, it was if they were made for them. The actors all generally had a special relationship with one another and with Peter Jackson (just watch the extras), and that what you are watching on screen is genuine. It was almost to the point that the actors weren't working so hard out of professionalism but out of love and devotion to Mr.Jackson. Hardly any other films can claim they had this kind of magic behind the camera. Honourable mentions will be given to Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Elijah Wood as Frodo, I felt these three literally became the characters they were playing, but of course there are countless others to mention but I don't have time. Howard Shore's score is possibly the best movie score ever, and the films would be nothing without it.\n\nUltimately say what you will hardcore Tolkien fans about the films, you cannot deny that they did so much for Tolkiens' greatest work and made it one of the most recognisable stories in the world. If you have somehow not seen these films, first of all slap yourself and secondly go buy the extended editions as these are the true versions of the films and include many great scenes that were cut - especially 'The Return of the King' which had many vital scenes cut aka. Saruman's last hoorah and Gandalf confronting the Witch King. Peter Jackson I salute you, and New Zealand!"

I like to think of the entire trilogy as one long movie-filmed simultaneously but obviously having had to be released over three parts to be profitable at the box office. Much like Tolkien's novel itself, having to be split in three volumes.\n\nThe quality of production and post-production all maintains its standards across the trilogy. I would like to say that although \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" remains my personal favorite of the three, \"The Return of the King\" being the one that finally brought home the clean sweep at the Oscars is very fitting and deserved.\n\nThe reincorporated scenes from the extended editions of all of these movies really helps a lot in fleshing out the world of Middle Earth. I can't imagine going back now to the theatrical cuts. A few scenes here and there do slow down the pacing just a bit, but in a movie as grand and epic as this, it's all for the better to extend our time in this unforgettable fantasy world that Tolkien so vividly described and that Jackson so faithfully brought to life on the big screen."

I enjoyed the first half of the film considerably and was prepared to accept it as a good final installment.\n\nUnfortunately, like \"The Two Towers\", the film moves from the sublime to the ridiculous with the introduction of the battle scene.\n\nI'm afraid I am not a fan of CG animation in live films. While the character of Gollum was well produced, the CG in the battles in lackluster and obvious. It is like being slapped in the face whenever it appears.\n\nEven leaving out the CG however, the biggest insult I find is that the main characters have to do everything. This was a particular problem in \"The Two Towers\", where the three heroes held off a whole army of orcs, but it is also prevalent in the battle in this movie.\n\nSure, I've heard of suspension of disbelief, but it can only go so far.\n\nUnlike most people, I didn't mind the long ending with Sam and Frodo but the film had already been ruined for me before that."

However, if, like the rest of us, you've been closely following the story of 'Middle Earth' where two innocent hobbits are carrying an evil ring of power to its destruction, then you'll be desperate to see how it ends. Although, based on what most people seem to think about the trilogy overall, 'The Return of the King' appears to be most people's favourite (worth noting that mine is 'The Two Towers!').\n\nMaybe it's because the source material (J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy of novels) has already been written that the concluding chapter is so good. Many stories start out with much promise and tend to die off (see the last series of 'Game of Thrones!'). Luckily, this doesn't happen here. Everything and everyone that made the saga great comes together and gives the audience the perfect ending that they deserve.\n\nYes, purists of the book may argue about the odd creative liberty here and there which has been taken when transferring it to the big screen, but, more often than not, everything lands where it should. Re-watching the trilogy today (nearly twenty years after its release) I noticed that some of the special effects in the first film ('Fellowship') didn't look quite so good as they did at the time (i.e. more green screen-ish), yet this final chapter seems as perfect as it was in its day.\n\nThere are so many fine performances in 'Return of the King' that it's hard to pick a favourite. In the first two movies I always preferred the human characters, such as Gandalf and Aragorn (and, of course, the computer-generated Gollum in 'The Two Towers'). Yet now, I really felt more of a connection to the two hobbits - Frodo and Sam. Following their journey I really did get a sense of how much they'd suffered here - a rare feat nowadays when so many on-screen heroes seem to be able to absorb inhuman amounts of punishment with barely a ruffled head of hair (and don't get me started on Disney's 'Star Wars' trilogy).\n\nAs I said before, you really need to watch the first film to know if you'll truly enjoy its conclusion and, if you do, then 'Return of the King' will certainly not disappoint. It has everything from great character-acting, to excellent special effects and a perfect setting and direction. Not since the ORIGINAL 'Star Wars' trilogy has a set of films come together so spectacularly."

Once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes, sets, scenery, models, CGI effects and Howard Shore's epic score to create a convincing depiction of Middle Earth.\n\nOnce again the cast delivers expert performances. John Noble joins the cast as Denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and repugnant character. Three of the performances in the film were particularly memorable for me. Bernard Hill once again brings authority to the role of King Theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. Miranda Otto brings strength to the role of Eowyn and makes the character's best moments unforgettable. Ian McKellen once again brought his commanding presence as Gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together.\n\nThis film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking Tolkien's work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. The famous battle at Minas Tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best fantasy battle ever filmed. As with the first two films, I found the added scenes for the extended addition interesting, but they didn't add much above and beyond the already great theatre cut."

Director Peter Jackson has achieved the impossible, to make this trilogy and make it so that Tolkien fans will be pleased with it in comparison to the book. The special effects are amazingly good, the actors (Sean Astin who play Samwise Gamgee particularly) are fabulous in their roles and the plot is unflawed, representing the book perfectly. There are parts left out but this was always to be expected. Peter Jackson, on first editing the film had a 6 hour long film that he was happy with. Now, although us Lord of the Rings fans may have been more than happy to sit through that, I don't think others would have been! So inevitably pieces and lines from the book have been taken out. But what we are left with is a film that works perfectly and is a masterpiece. Undoubtedly there will be plenty of extra footage on the extended DVD and so we'll just have to wait for that to see the film in its entirety. It's, arguably and in my own opinion, the best of the three films and one that fans and just movie-goers will love. It's got action, romance and an ending that leaves us satisfied and wanting to see it again and again. Go and see it now!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of \"Lord of the Rings\" reaches its pinnacle in \"Return of the King.\" The stellar cast, mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie, which is not only the last of the \"Lord of the Rings\" films, but the best.\n\nFrodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realises his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...\n\nMeanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \\Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...\n\nThe \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.\n\nPeter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in \"Two Towers\" and \"Fellowship of the Ring,\" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In \"Return of the King,\" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.\n\nBut if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.\n\nElijah Wood gives an unparallelled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the \"strong\" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.\n\nBut all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the \"I'm going to take care of you\" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.\n\nPerhaps the most striking thing about \"Return of the King\" is the final fourth of the film. While the \"multiple endings\" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.\n\n\"Return of the King\" brings the epic \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the \"Lord\" films -- and that's saying something."

Most trilogies that exist have the problem of the third being the weakest in the bunch. Not with this trilogy, though, this film is incredible on all levels.\n\nThis film's drama and overall epicness is something I have simply not seen since its release. Not many films can so effortlessly blend fantasy and serious dramatic plot elements that sell the film's overall message.\n\nNot to forget the amazing display of acting that the whole cast put together. This is one aspect of the movie that does not appear to be getting enough credit. EVERYONE sells every scene and contributes to the film's immersion.\n\nThe Return of the King holds the record, in a tie, for the most academy awards ever won and I cannot think of another film more deserving of this honor. The world-building displayed by Peter Jackson, coupled with the cast and crew, has not been matched outside of this series."

This is what happens in this part: Sam screams at Gollum, Frodo defends Gollum, Gollum speaks to himself, Frodo is in mortal danger and Sam saves him. They've been doing the very same thing over and over again since the beginning of The Two Towers.\n\nThen the other part: also a replay of The Two Towers, I'm afraid. Orcs attack a human stronghold and the humans barely survive. The battle is even the same: everything is almost lost and then re-enforcements arrive saving the day.\n\nIt's also quite obvious that Viggo Mortenssen was a very bad choice for a pivotal part in this movie. His acting is wooden and his courageous speech before the battle is so powerless, mainly because of his wimpy voice and his foreign accent doesn't help either.\n\nThe ending starts about half an hour before the credits and just keeps going on and on. Aragon is crowned king and that should have been it. But no, they need to sugar coat everyone's exit till it almost made me throw up.\n\nOk, the source material does dictate how it ends (although the ending of the book was better), but it could've been made better by just ending after the coronation.\n\nSo 3 out 3 movies that were only half interesting. So, maybe time for a new cut with only the interesting parts (about three hours for the whole lot would do)."

This story is fantasy that isn't quite convincing. I didn't feel that you got to know the characters at all which made you feel distant from what was happening. I'm not a particular fan of this genre, but it can be effective if it convinces you that you are there and that it is real. I would watch this film, purely as something to fill a couple of hours. Long movies are always hard to keep at a good standard the whole way through and often drop down in your ratings, within the last half hour. This is why I give it a 5, because it really is in the middle. Nothing very bad, just nothing to shout about."

        "review_detailed_main": "Finally, after a series of magical books by J.R.R. Tolkien, and after the first two movies in a series that redefined cinema, \"The Lord of the Rings\" series finally comes to a close, with \"The Return of the King\". I'm so pleased to be saying the following words. This movie is not just the best in this magical series, but it's also mostly one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. The final story picks up where \"The Two Towers\" left off, where Frodo and Sam are still traveling to Mordor, while Gollum might set them in a trap to capture the ring at last. Then, Gandalf and the gang are still trying to defeat the wrath of Sauron, and finally be able to destroy this deadly ring. Thanks to the incredible masterful directing by Peter Jackson, and thousands of artists and technicians, they all help us dig deeper into this magical world that, only at the movies, we can be able to escape to. The performances are just brilliant and electrifying to watch on screen. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are just brilliant, continuing their roles as Frodo and Sam, and they still have a lot of heart and soul into their on-screen friendship. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen improves once again with fine and brilliant performances. But out of all that, it's Andy Serkis that should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2003, for his work as Gollum. Serkis has portrayed such a brilliant character, and the visual enhancements made to create him was all quite super. From an opening flashback involving Smeagol (a.k.a. Gollum) that's super thrilling, to a final setback, Gollum is by far the best character in this movie. Although this movie is set during a long 200 minute run-time, I was just distracted for what this movie had to offer, that I didn't care about how long it was. It has everything you'd expect to see. It's got heartbreak, action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and magic. The special effects are exhilarating, from beginning to end, and it made me wanting for more. The beautiful art direction and costumes made me feel like I escaped to a more beautiful place. The cinematography is challenging in such perfection, and the original score is really with a treat. I also adored the wonderful sound effects, and the memorable film editing. The love stories are touching, the friendship scenes are heartwarming, the fight scenes are groundbreaking, and the finale blends with a perfect mix of heartbreak and hope. I could tell you a thousand reasons why this movie is excellent. This is a movie that loves movies. It's a movie that keeps you wanting for more. All this movie needed was a talented director, a brilliant cast, groundbreaking special effects, incredible art direction, amazing music, and an inspirational storyline. This is such a crowning achievement in cinema. It's one of my all-time favorite movies, and I'm glad this movie won the Best Picture Oscar in 2003. \"LOTR: The Return of the King\", in my review, \"an epic and groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece\"."

However, none of the other characters in the remaining part of the fellowship suffered no more than 3 seconds of any kind of acting at a time, as nearly all the dialogue from the book is erased. And at the ending sequence, when Frodo wakes up, the cheerful scenes drag on forever, when Peter Jackson could have saved it by cutting off half the slow motion and instead, showing the last parts of the book with the burning & enslavement of the shire, and the uprising that followed. All in all, it was a good movie. Cinematic, epic, and, above all, bloody."

It's hard to deny the great panorama the movie generated, the 1000 minute-long battle scene, the over sized elephants. but the clich\u00e9, flat dialogs that should be the spine of the movie, turned out to be an arthritis, that made me, as an audience, gasped and itched like I just saw one of those lifetime-channel original movie. There was no real great dramatic acting, all actors seem weary and only put on one emotion, and unlike the excellent first part of LOTR, where they have frodo, an average-joe hobbit turned into the ultimate ring bearer, puzzled and over bared by this new-found strenuous job he now has, the drama is alive by other characters struggle to convince frodo and themselves to defeat their own fear to fight for humanity. I like to see more of that than the battle scenes, and this I thought was a huge loss. And lest us not forget the gazillion endings return of the king has."

And then in the next 3 and a half hours, I was proved wrong!\n\nThis was the best conclusion to a great trilogy. I never imagined that they could make it bigger and better than the last two. The previous movies were just picnic. Not only the action sequences but also the emotions run high. The battle scenes were really great. But I was more concerned about the people we knew from the last two films who were in it.\n\nYou really get that feeling of \"The Return\". Unlike the first two, this movie is stylish. The elements are more elegant, the story more bold, the score more experienced and bold and the dangers more troublesome. As Frodo and Sam march towards Mount Doom, the movie gets more darker and hope really seems to fade away. One thing I learned in this movie is: Never give up. No matter what happens you have to finish the task because your cause is important.\n\nFor me and all the LOTR fans, this is not a movie. What we thought of as an action movie-of-the-week turned out to be an important lesson on hope, friendship, conquering your fears and love. It's a cinematic achievement that will never be defeated. This really is the king of all movies and the 11 golden statues prove it. Go for it (Only if you have seen the first two movies)\n\n10/10"

There rules Denethor (John Noble) , father of the deceased Boromir (Sean Bean) , and Faramir (David Wenham) . While Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must choose between his two lovers , Eowyn (Miranda Otto) and Arwen(Liv Tyler) . Later on , Aragorn , Legolas (Orlando Jones) , and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) travel to the creepy caves inhabited by the Army of the Dead .\n\nThis sensational epic adventure is plenty of action , impressive battles , spectacular drama and being pretty entertaining . The movie packs a real sense of wonder and stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown feats of the various protagonists and winding up in overlong battles and a stunning finale . It contains incredible array of technical visual effects by Weta Digital and Weta Workship , among others companies . Sensational cinematography by Andrew Lesnie and spectacular as well as sensitive musical score by Howard Shore , winning deservedly Academy Award . Beautifully realized set design with phenomenal production values . The film provides enough amusement during the three and half hour and stays closer to the novel than any of the former adaptations -mostly animated and in low budget- such as the mediocre effort by Ralph Baski . The motion picture will appeal to Tolkien followers as the neophyte who didn't have seen the previous parts and those unfamiliar with the lengthy literary work . Magnificent direction by Peter Jackson bringing stunningly the imaginary world and mythology of Tolkien to life ."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm writing this review as I watch Fellowship again right now. I was 12 when Fellowship first released in the cinema, and LOTR defined my life ever since for many years, and the trilogy has remained my favourite movies, with no others that come close. They made me cry in the cinema, and in every viewing since. I can put on even a brief portion of the films, and the feelings come rushing back. Everything about these three movies is perfect, in my opinion, especially the amazing music that is so perfectly crafted that I can't think of a better movie soundtrack. The only OST that matches it is the Halo game soundtrack. Both the Halo and LOTR franchise began in the same year (2001), and were the two major pillars of my life since childhood.\n\nIt's crazy to think that this trilogy began almost 20 years ago. I wonder if anything will ever touch LOTR. I suspect it will remain the all-time pinnacle of cinema, at least for the sheer love of them it has inspired in its vast fanbase.\n\nI think that the extended editions are indispensable and feel much more complete than the original cinematic releases. They are definitely worth watching in one sitting, back-to-back, which will take from wake til sleep, with breaks in between for second breakfast, elevenses, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, supper.\n\nAlthough I think Return of the King is the greatest possible ending to the greatest trilogy ever made, I still feel Fellowship of the Ring, where it all began, is the most rewatchable and comfy of the three. It has an air of enticing, dark and foreboding mystery that always captivates me. And that ending... what a cliff-hanger. I still remember the excitement it first created in me for the story's continuation, and the year-long wait for The Two Towers to release in the cinema. I would pay good money to see them all in a large and full theatre again.\n\nAnd the video games... I played most of them I think. I still play Battle for Middle Earth, i.e. the Edain mod.\n\nI can't imagine what my life would have been like if the LOTR films had never been created as they were, as they have been that important to me for well over half of my time alive at this point. They played a part in inspiring me to travel, to pursue filmmaking, and most importantly to get me interested in Tolkien's works.\n\nI am so thankful to everyone who were a part of creating them, as they are easily the greatest treasure of cinema."

Such as aragon's character, Viggo Mortensen matchs that style and his emotions were amazing. his fighting style and knowledge makes him a great character and Viggo Mortensen should of good a dozen awards. before this film, i never heard of Viggo Mortensen and now after his role, i regard him as a brilliant actor.\n\nanother character who was amazing was gandalf and without him, this film would feel empty. sir ian meleken (sorry for the spelling mistake), his acting was so believable and amazing. but his secret to this as revealed in a episode of extras, his that he thought of what it would be like to be a wizard and well, that give us the great gandalf we know today! i think this film is the best film i have seen in years and it deserved every award. out of ten, i would give this a MASSIVE TEN! thank you!"

The culmination of this ambitious trilogy is more than fitting; it surpasses the first two films by quite a distance. Almost nothing disappointed or bothered me. All parts of the story were equally interesting. It was sweeping, it was involving, it was beautiful. One of the few thing I would complain about is the villain. Sauron is boring and more or less unseen. He does not feel very threatening. And his army of orcs has been dull since the first film. They're just not very interesting creatures. Fortunately, The Return of the King really makes up for these monsters with a gallery of better ones. Some of them have been present in the other two films, trolls and those flying dragons that the ring wraiths ride on. They're more present here, however. Even better, though, those gigantic elephants, ten times the size of a normal one. Oh, man, those are cool. Star Wars fans might grumble that they were too much like the AT-AT walkers from Empire, and they are. One scene where Legolas, the elf, triumphs over one of them feels like a sped up version of Luke Skywalker's attack. But the very best thing is a giant spider. Everyone knows that there was originally a giant spider on skull island in King Kong, cut from the film because it really disturbed a test audience. Seeing the spider in Return of the King is like having that famous piece of lost footage restored. When all three films are finally out on their special edition DVDs, I'm going to spend a month combing through them to see whether or not the entire series of films isn't just as good as this one, or perhaps as good as many of my younger friends have sworn they were."

Even though he might not have deserved them all this year he had to get his 11 awards just to prove that the jury has taste, and to equal it to Ben Hur and... Titanic...(You see what I mean).

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, it's finally over: Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's mediocre epic concludes with *The Return of the King*, a 3-1/2-hour test of endurance. How many times can a movie show Elijah Wood's big blue eyes welling up with tragic tears? how many times do our heroes single-handedly dispatch thousands of evil creatures apiece during big battles? how many times do we have to endure the jokes from that hairy dwarf? how many times must Howard Shore's repetitive, sappy score rise to deafening levels whenever a minor character lies in a broken heap on the battlefield? how many times must director Jackson waste his wide screen photography with gigantic close-ups of the actors (I haven't seen so many BIG HEADS since the last Academy Awards broadcast)? how many times must we withstand grand, cartoon-animated armies? . . . and how many more times must we watch plot developments that contain virtually no suspense?? (What -- did you think the Dark Lord would win? that any of the main characters of the Fellowship would actually die?)\n\nApparently, many MORE times, because this 3-1/2-hour trudge is but the appetizer to the main course of the \"Extended Edition\", New Line's continuing money-grab that will reveal perhaps a FIVE-HOUR version of this movie alone. (Taken all together, *The Lord of the Rings* -- The Extended Version -- approaches the length of 14 hours, give or take.) Well, as P. T. Barnum once observed, There's a sucker born every minute, and New Line has found the suckers, who are not only willing to pay at the movie theater, but are also only too willing to fork out exorbitant amounts for \"special editions\" of movies that ought to have stood on their own -- AS RELEASED. A simple standard should obtain in a movie theater: what you're seeing on the screen should be what a director wants you to see. \"Extended-edition DVD's\" don't count, and especially should not be taken in consideration in reviews by either professional critics or by amateur reviewers at places like IMDb. I can already hear the defenders of the films demur, \"But these movies would've been too long if Jackson didn't cut them into shorter versions!\" But that's precisely my point. *The Lord of the Rings* remains an unfilmable book: it's too long; it's too unwieldy. As far as an adaptation is concerned, none -- not less -- would be more.\n\nWhich is not to say that there aren't any great filmic moments in *Return of the King*: the lighting of the watch-fires along the mountain ranges is pure cinema; the entire scene with Frodo and Sam fending off a giant spider in a cobwebby cave is terrific, providing the one suspenseful stretch in the entire movie; and Gollum remains a wonderful creation, a rare successful collaboration of technology and old-fashioned creative virtues. Taken as a whole, the movie is better than, say, *The Matrix* or other expensive Hollywood blockbusters of the \"action-adventure\" genre. But to say so is not to say much. The occasional high points don't constitute a comprehensive whole, or make Tolkien's saga any less silly. It's a book about magic rings, wizards, Dark Lords, and dwarfs, for God's sake. In *Return of the King*, there's a scene in Minas Tirith where the citizens watch a sad parade of soldiers go by: but it's comical, because everyone looks like refugees from a Renaissance Faire. It doesn't do to inflate this material to cosmic levels. Claims that Tolkien's fantasy was the greatest book of the 20th Century truly make my head spin: what, was *Ulysses* chopped liver? What was the second greatest book -- Stephen King's *The Stand*?\n\nPardon my long-windedness, but the very subject inspires it. I'll wrap by lamenting that one of the better elements in the first two installments, Christopher Lee as Saruman, was a victim of the cutting room floor. Even fans of this material might agree with me that any number of the scenes with Frodo and Sam blubbering at each other would've been better replaced with a coda to the Saruman plot-line. While others may say, \"Well, he'll be in the Extended-Edition version,\" I'm sure that will be cold comfort to Mr. Lee. At least Saruman was a villain we could sink our teeth into: in *Return*, we must instead settle for that damned Eyeball atop that tower. Granted, in this film the Eyeball has developed the power to sort of roll about, rather like a lighthouse lamp, but it's still a pretty lame villain. Here, perhaps more than anywhere, Jackson reveals the limitations of his source material. In the book, as I recall, Sauron's Eyeball was really more of a psychological entity. Grasping for any straw, Jackson has made the Eyeball a concrete reality, so that we would have SOMETHING to identify as a villain. But don't fret: Sauron's Nose will doubtless turn up in the Extended Edition. In the meantime, sweet dreams, everyone."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the world of high fantasy has not been particularly well-served by cinema. The genre was not even really taken seriously in literature until the 1960s. During the 80s, there was a fad for fantasy movies, but while most of these looked nice and were good enough fun, none of them really had magnificence (although the 1981 Excalibur movie comes pretty close). It was not until the first decade of the 20th century that we saw fantasy cinema's rather delayed coming-of-age.\n\nAs with the first two movies in the trilogy the transition from novel to screenplay is exceptional. There's a lot more action and a lot less dialogue in this one, and yet the plot is still clear and the narrative never feels repetitive. The idea of binding the various story lines together in time \u2013 such as when the Witch-King arises near Frodo and Sam, but the tower of green light is seen miles away by Pippin \u2013 are great for building up the tension. They also really help to establish this vision of Middle Earth as a real place with vast dimensions.\n\nAnd again Jackson proves himself to be an action director with that little extra flair of intelligence. At first glance his work seems very much aimed at those with short attention spans, but there is so much loaded into each and every shot, the camera following an orc as he falls to the ground, or coming to rest upon a woman holding a baby as panic erupts in the city. His horror-tinged imagining of certain scenes is truly unnerving.\n\nThere is some all-round improved acting in this instalment. Perhaps the years wrapped up in the production were taking the necessary toll on the cast. There are some truly heartfelt moments from Bernard Hill and a wonderfully spirited turn from Miranda Otto. For me, Billy Boyd always stood out as the finest of the hobbit performers, and this is the movie where he comes to the forefront, demonstrating great dignity and emotion. The best performance however, as previously, belongs to Ian McKellen as Gandalf. There's something strangely knowing in his final scene.\n\nOne of the unfortunate things about The Return of the King is that it suffers worse than the first two movies from a lack of dignity at certain times. The CGI Gollum is too cutesy and it's hard to believe in him as an antagonist, although funnily enough the glimpse we get of partly-transformed Smeagol biting into a fish with Andy Serkis in prosthetics would have been perfect for the whole thing. Some of the most serious bits become silly. I remember laughing out loud in the cinema when Gandalf says \"So passes Denethor\u0085\" when the man is still pathetically running around in flames.\n\nBut by-and-large, this is an exceptional production, with its most outstanding touches in the way the whole thing has been put together. When the beacons are lit stretching a line across a mountain range, it's done in such a smooth, rhythmic way we are simultaneously impressed by the immense scale, the beauty of the landscape and the sheer brilliance of it as a means of communication. When Pippin's haunting song continues in the background as the men of Gondor ride off to their doom, we feel the depth of what is going on in a way the images alone could not impart. This is the kind of thinking you don't see in those numerous 80s fantasy movies, or in sci-fi's big trilogy, Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings movies put us right within both the excitement and the sadness of the story, for me with greater weight than Tolkien himself achieved. It elevates this above being merely another CGI action flick and grants the fantasy genre a status and stature it has never enjoyed before."

        "review_detailed_main": "In terms of the individual installments of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings epic trilogy, Return of the King may actually be my least favorite (if only by a hair). The character-building isn't needed, like in Fellowship, and the battles are no better than those in Two Towers. The film's length (even the 3.5 hour theatrical cut) borders on prohibitive. Yet, it remains a slam-dunk 10/10 effort. The reason? The emotional payoffs to all the threads set up in those previous two installments.\n\nFor a very basic overview, Return of the King sees the two primary plots of the trilogy reach their apex:\n\n-Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), & Gollum/Smeagle (Andy Serkis) finally reach Mordor--but not before a significant detour along the way and a gut-wrenching decision at the journey's end.\n\n-Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) reclaims his kingly birthright and leads the denizens of Middle Earth in a final battle with Sauron's minions. Along for the ride again are feisty dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) the marksman Elf, and hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) & Pippin (Billy Boyd) doing the best they can to contribute to the cause.\n\nThe overall hallmark of this concluding chapter is the way in which it pays off all the threads set up in the previous two. This one doesn't have to break new ground, and largely doesn't. It just needs to put an amen to perhaps the most incredible book-to-film adaptation of all-time, which it accomplishes with aplomb. What Jackson really understands is how much of a journey the audience has taken alongside the famous fantasy characters (especially true if experienced during the three-year theatrical run). The end of their journey is also the end of \"ours\", in other words.\n\nSpecifically notable here is the last half hour or so of runtime, where the visuals, music, direction, & acting meld together to create some of the most emotionally rousing scenes of the whole trilogy. I have yet to behold these moments without a tear being shed.\n\nOverall, then, Return of the King is a regal ending to Jackson's masterful vision. It may not break much cinematic new ground, but it doesn't have too. It simply does its job: pay off all the previously-established action, adventure, drama, humor, and (most of all) heart."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 2003, Lord of the Rings- Return of the King won top honors at nearly every major Award ceremony, and set a new record for box-office receipts, one that would stand for six years. It blew audiences away with its epic storytelling and scale, surpassing even the previous two entries in the trilogy. It was a truly great film. And now with the extended version, it's even better than before.\n\nThe reason why Return of the King, is so great is threefold. First, it's based on one of the twentieth century's greatest works of literature. Secondly, director Peter Jackson has remained true to source material, leaving as much as possible intact. And lastly, this project saw a near unprecedented infusion of talent and money. From the director, to the extremely large cast, to the effects wizards at WETA, everyone knew what they were doing and gave it their very best. Nothing was held back, no expense spared, and no detail overlooked, and the result is pure awesomeness.\n\nOne of Tolkien's greatest talents as a writer was his ability to fill his worlds with a host of distinct, interesting characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and struggles. Jackson has included nearly all, and through them explores myriad themes. In Aragorn (Vigo Mortenson) we see a man who overcome his self-doubt and accept the mantle of greatness that he was meant to wear. He's also the embodiment of true courage, being brave or perhaps crazy enough to pick up the seeing stone and tell Sauron, \"Here I am, come and get me.\"\n\nIn Frodo (Elijah Wood) the story explores how even the most ordinary of people can accomplish great things, but also how even the purest can be tempted by power and corrupted by evil. One figure who cannot be corrupted however is Samwise Gamgee, who represents perhaps the ultimate example of friendship and loyalty, sharing every hardship, remaining ever vigilant against Gollum's treachery and the ring's corruption, and braving a giant spider and a fortress of orcs to rescue his friend, even after he had turned on him.\n\nEven the relatively minor Characters are well drawn and add to the story. Take Pippin and Merry. They're just a couple of goof-offs, the friends who are just along for the ride. But before the story is done, both will play important roles in the greatest battle of the age. Aeowen for her part embodies both duty to one's people and the the pain of unrequited love. And Legalos and Gimli, though largely relegated to sidekick duty, still show how friendship can transcend racial boundaries and old grudges.\n\nBut the most interesting character of all must surely be Gollum. Twisted physically and mentally, and with a severe case of split personality, he hates his very existence, and he hates the Ring for what it's done to him, but he desires to possess it even more. He's like a schizoid drug addict- a violent yet often hilarious schizoid drug addict. It's amazing how quickly he can go from playful and comical to pure venom. And no-one does a more unsettling conversation with himself. He's murderous, he's repulsive, he's pitiful, and he's one of the most interesting characters in twentieth century literature.\n\nOf course this isn't all internal struggles and character development; it's an epic in the class of The Ten Commandments or Gone with the Wind, but with lots more fighting. And what fighting it is! The combat scenes capture the full intensity and brutality of medieval warfare, of pounding clubs and maces, bodies impaled with spears and arrows, or crushed beneath catapult stones (Within the bounds of PG-13). Yet there's also is the precision, even beauty, of Aragorn's swordsmanship, and Legelos's skill with the bow, their ability to fell an enemy with every swing of the sword or release of an arrow.\n\nAnd then there's the sheer scale of it all. The climactic battle of Pelenor Fields is the largest ever filmed, with dozens of siege engines, more than two-hundred thousand orcs, and a charge by six thousand horsemen. There are few sights that can surpass six thousand armored cavalrymen at full charge, but a counter charge by a line of mumukhiel is surely one of them. Add the piercing shrieks of fell beasts and an army of vengeful dead and you have perhaps the greatest spectacle ever to grace the screen. This may seem hyperbole, or even heretical, but Cecil B. Demile has nothing on Peter Jackson.\n\nI'm also highly impressed with the effects and technical aspects of this movie. The set pieces are among the largest and grandest I've seen, and the models have a nearly unprecedented attention to detail. And there are thousands of weapons, orc masks, and suits of armor, all beautifully \u2013 or gruesomely- done. Few projects can equal this one in the costume and make-up departments. New Zealand's Weta Workshop might just be the new Industrial Light and Magic.\n\nNow obviously all this was already present in the original version. So you may ask if this new version is worth paying to see, especially if you already have the original. My answer: absolutely. There's more humor, exemplified by a side-splitting drinking contest, and more character development, especially with Faramir and Denathor. And there's lots more action, including Gandalf's encounter with the Witch King, a longer fight scene with Gollum, and far more material with the dead men of Dun-Harrow. Jackson has also included important vignettes from the book like the House of Healing scene and negotiations with the Mouth of Sauron. And I particularly enjoyed Christopher Lee's death scene near the beginning.\n\nBottom line, Lord of the Rings, Return of the King is one of the grandest, most exciting, and most inspiring movies you'll ever witness. Try as I might, I can find no fault with it. You owe it to yourself to see this movie, especially in its new and improved state."

No smart military leader would ever have ordered to attack such foe head-on (and still succeed...). You could bet that in each and every new scene, trouble was only about 30 seconds away. Very annoying. Did Aragon ever smile once? Always looked like having a big tummy ache. Any of the others smiling? OK, Gandalf did once, I think. The end was as kitchy as it could be - and incomprehensible, to me at least: Why would Frodo choose to leave the Shire?? It may be in the book or not, I don't care. This just didn't make any sense.^\n\nTechnically of course it was more than state of the art, but even this got me bored eventually. I was glad when this part and the whole series was finally over.\n\nThis project would have been better served in a TV series of say 900 minutes or so. Of course, it would have lost the big-screen \"oversize\" which was nice most of the times. But the movies as long as they were did not do justice to the books. Probably no movie(s) could ever achieve this."

        "review_detailed_main": "The third and final part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is an entry that is once again visually impressive to the point of perfection, but also once again with little substance. Nevertheless, the film is to able better its predecessors in two key areas. It is less monotonous than the first two, and the characterisation is better than in the first two. However, by now better character development is of no use; the story has developed much too far without effectively involving the viewer. It is almost like a pretentious effort to suck in the viewers in the final part who were warded away earlier on by poor character development. Another point worthy of noting is that it is not overlong this time \u0096 that would be an understatement. It is severely overlong. The producers just do not know how to end a film. There are so many points when you think you have reached the closure that the whole last half hour is completely anticlimactic. To look at the films in perspective, they are all of about the same in quality, which is no surprise: they are just different cuts of one long film. All are above average films, as they have interesting technical elements. But they are not successes, because the writing is not up to the standard of the other aspects of the film. Adapting to the screen Tolkein's story was a massive task, and it did require a lot of effort, but what one looks for when assessing a film is was it successful? Film critique for me is about rewarding success \u0096 not how much effort one puts in. It is impossible to deny how much effort the whole cast and crew went to in order to produce this spectacular looking film, but they only ever half-succeeded in capturing the magic of Tolkein's tales."

But, in the third act of the movie, there are 3 major scenes, each of which brought me to complete tears. One of them is the greatest single moment I've ever seen in movies, period. Throughout the movie, it's very evident that it was made by people who clearly adored the source and a great attention to detail can be found throughout.\n\nI've seen complaints that at some points the movie diverges from the source material too much or that it's longer and doesn't pack as much substance. I feel the first point can be validated by artistic liberties, while the second ultimately boils down to personal preferences. Speaking personally, the movie did not feel long. The screenplay justifies the runtime, and makes the movie cohesive. It's the grand finale to the greatest trilogy of all time, and completely cements its legacy for years to come.\n\nNOTE: This review is based off of the special extended editions, and not the theatrical cut."

This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all. This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon, Gimli, and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one. This one has epic battles and great visuals as well. It is also very well acted. Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one. All in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch. I would write more, but I am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than I can."

The only problem it has is that you are so engaged for its entire length that you are worn out and exhausted by the end. In fact it is likely that you had just recently completed the first two films adding onto that exhaustion and to make matters worse it's probably your 50th time doing the marathon. All of this is of course a compliment and not a complaint.\n\nThese films are the ultimate battle of good versus evil. They make no effort to try to explain away why evil is the way it is and instead hammers home the message that sometimes compromise can't and shouldn't be pursued and that it takes strong, brave, and courageous characters working together to put a stop to the spread of evil.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing about this movie I would change.

        "review_detailed_main": "Not surprisingly, a lot of good plot had been removed from the story, and a lot of bad plot inserted. This is hardly news; the same happened to the two predecessors. Much was lost by skipping \"The Scouring of the Shire\". The computer graphics are well-done but rarely convincing, and Gollum's only task is to provide comic relief. Most of the audience seemed to find him quite funny. I was just bored.\n\nTolkien's books told a great story basically about the weakness of men (and other races), and the importance of not fighting alone. The best example being the events on the edge of Mount Doom. Tolkien made a strong point in that nobody is perfect, neither perfectly good nor perfectly evil.\n\nThe film completely ignores this and simplifies things to pure black and white. There's good, and there's evil, with nothing in-between , no shades of grey.\n\nAnd that I think is sad.\n\nAll that being said, the film has a few but important qualities, and that's the great camera work, the excellent acting and the stunning scenery - CG-scenery too.\n\nThe rest of the CG is not that interesting, except for Shelob the spider who really makes up for it. The sound of a whole cinema audience simultaneously gasping in horror as ... Well, I won't spoil for those who haven't read the books. But wow. So, in the end, despite all its flaws, I recommend seeing this film. But go see it now, on the big screen. It won't be worth your time on TV."

        "review_title": "The biggest problem of all is lack of character development ...",
        "review_detailed_main": "I went to see ROTK for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws, want to concentrate on major issues surrounding Jackson's character development.\n\nARAGORN is the first big problem. In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king. He knows who he is, and he has an expectation of that destiny. Likewise in the book he has 'spiritual' awareness. Aragorn is descended, not merely from men, but from Numenor: so he already has in him some of the blood of the Elves. Now Jackson gives all foresight to the Elves - making the men merely, men. But the whole point is that the-man-born-to-be-king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old. Thus, in book II at the river it is Aragorn, not Legolas (as in Jackson's version), who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart. And, more significantly, it is Aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right (Gandalf actually bows to give it to him). Gandalf counsels him not to use it, but Aragorn knows who he is. So he looks in the palantir and shows Sauron the sword. He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills, not as Sauron wills. In so doing he sees the black fleet, and so knows the threat. That's why he takes the path of the dead. And when he goes under the Dimholt he REALLY summons the dead. The exchange in the film between Aragorn and the Geoffrey-Rush-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-look-alike ghost is feeble in the film. In the book Aragorn does not doubt who he is: he calls them, not barters with them.\n\nNow Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson. As a result we're left with a desperately anti-climactic coronation. Why? There's simply been no character development of Aragorn. He's been denuded of a sense of who he is.\n\nSAURON is the next big problem. It's true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the Eye. But he also has personality. In the film, apart from the opening sequence to film I (which was brilliant) all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight. Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why on earth didn't Jackson then develop Sauron from the figure in film I? In the book, we are told of Sauron's gnawing doubt. We hear of reports about 'spies' entering Mordor. We know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of Elendil. None of this is developed in the film. (And the Ring seems to lose power on entering Mordor, not gain it!) Result? There was no sense of elation at the fall of Barad'dur.\n\nNow this is a serious theological error that I suspect Tolkien would have detested. Personify good, and you must also personify evil. Tolkien's epic was all about those forces being personified: and how you discern them. Sauron is a personification of evil. He's not actually the worst - that belongs to Morgoth (of whom the Balrog is a servant). Whilst Tolkien rightly loathed allegory, he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy. The whole point, and if this isn't obvious in the world today then Jackson is even less astute than I imagined, is that evil in many guises takes human form.\n\nOTHERS\n\nThe same lack of characterisation in Aragorn and Sauron goes on with many of the others. Notable exceptions are GANDALF and SARUMAN (both well acted). Jackson made a mistake in cutting Saruman out of III having made so much of him in I and II (more than the book). ARWEN is drippy throughout. EOWYN is changed in the film. Miranda Otto was excellent. But Jackson plays up the love between her and Aragorn so much that we are left wondering how Eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with Arwen. On the subject of Eowyn it's such a shame Jackson didn't do the slaying of the witch-king better. In the book the battlefield pauses - a cloud goes up and everyone in Minas Tirith is happy. It's one of the truly great moments, lost by Jackson. The reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above Shelob's lair so that Sam and Frodo hear that 'No.1. has been done in'.\n\nAs for the HOBBITS . I think this may be a question of preference. Personally I think Sean Astin's acting as SAM is execrable, but some like it. For me, the simple gardener becomes a mini-philosopher and I find his soliloquy both at the end of film II in Osgiliath (to which they never go in the book) and on the mountain (twice) truly toe-curlingly dreadful: pap I'm afraid. And, oh dear, we even veered towards Titanic-music-moments at the end of film I and again on the mountain. BILBO was fine until the end. Yes, we know he ages fast now he's lost the ring, but the Salieri-style prosthetics are poor. Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!). A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing. Argh - this is kindergarten film production.\n\nI expect the film will garner the Oscars ceremony. But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g. the oliphaunt descent by Legolas, the Merrick-style leader of the orcs, and the Army of the dead), the film is not actually very good.\n\nPeter - I'm afraid you've let us, and J.R.R. Tolkien, down."

But do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film? No, they will never do. The siege of Minas Tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. The final battle near Mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. The brilliant array of talents of Weaving, Mortensen, Wood, Tyler, Serkis, Urban, Wenham, Astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. The film has stood the test of time, and any time you see the Sauron fall, you feel elation, pride, joy and great triumph. The Good has won again, and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins, it will reign for ever and ever. The final scene of the film, with the parting of Bilbo and Frodo together with the great elves and Gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears, for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us. Many films may be made on the eternal novel of Mr. Tolkien, but this epic will stand in our memory eternally. The road goes ever on."

Meanwhile, Aragon and friends prepare to stand off against Sauron's army in hopes of distracting them long enough for Frodo to slip by then and destroy the ring. Likelihood for success is low but hope is high...\n\nThis movie is directed by Peter Jackson (Bad Taste) and stars Elijah Wood (The Faculty), Viggo Mortensen (Hidalgo), Ian McKellen (Gods and Monsters), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean), Sean Astin (The Goonies), Cate Blanchett (The Aviator) and Liv Tyler (Armageddon).\n\nThere is nothing that isn't perfect about this movie except you never want it to end. The settings are so beautiful and well filmed. The cast is perfectly selected and demonstrate both their desperation and their will to push forward. The inner struggles within every character is perfectly depicted. The attire, props and use of CGI to create both magic and monsters was awesome. The battle scenes are epic and the ending is absolutely amazing and closes the trilogy perfectly.\n\nOverall this is the greatest fantasy series ever created that is an absolute must see. I would score this a strong 10/10 and consider it an absolute must see."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's just incredible how well Return of the King wraps up the overall Lord of the Rings trilogy. Things expand and branch off in wild directions in The Two Towers, likely making first-time viewers pessimistic it could all come together. But come together it most certainly does, with The Return of the King delivering spectacle, emotion, and large-scale action that few other blockbusters have come close to equaling in the 20 years since its release.\n\nInstead of gushing endlessly about things other people have already gushed about (I agree with all the positive things anyone has said), all I can really add is that the extended editions made me love The Return of the King even more. Even though the theatrical version is still about 200 minutes long, numerous great scenes didn't make the cut. Seeing them back in for a final installment that now spans 4+ hours really makes everything gel better. It made a great film into a fantastic one.\n\nI used to feel like the various endings of The Return of the King took too long. After watching all three movies as effectively one movie - and doing all the extended versions in one go to boot - the ending feels just as well-paced as the rest of the movie. All the scenes in the epilogue feel earned and truly emotional. The longer journey spent with these characters seems to make all the difference, and I feel like generally speaking, the extended versions are probably superior overall (though there's a scene or two here and there that feels superfluous for sure).\n\nAnyway, The Return of the King is fantastic. The whole trilogy is fantastic. I don't know how Peter Jackson and everyone else made such a big trilogy that all works so well. It holds up after 20+ years, and I'm starting to wonder whether it will ever even age at this point."

I myself have read the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien and in light of this can say that this film has to be one of the adaptations in recent times. Peter Jackson, I feel simply could not have done a better job in using the beautiful new zealand landscape to portray Tolkien's vision.\n\nWithout a doubt the speech, roars and sheer numbers of the rohirrim at the pellennor charge in the sunset is truly the greatest sequence of film i have ever seen. People say the ending is too long, I say it was perfect as it gave a heart felt and fitting deneaumont, and ended a truly remarkable trilogy that will not be soon forgotten."

On the other hand, it's definitely better than The Two Towers, which I think is by far the weakest of the three films.\n\nAll in all Return of the King is certainly a good film, but it's too long, the battle scenes somewhat lack intensity and when it's all over you're left with this lingering \"was that it?\". Don't get me wrong, I like the film, but it does feel as something of an anti-climax. Perhaps it's simply not possible to transfer the enormity and intensity of what's meant to take place to film. The battle scenes are a bit dull, they lack intensity and realism, which is too bad because the battle scenes are in many ways the most important part of the film. To make it all worse (at least as I see it), they try to make up for it with slapstick, kill count and silly comments from Gimli, who is again reduced to comic relief, as well as a tendency to focus on the \"really big stuff\" (TM); oliphants, various trolls and the big siege weapons, instead of really following the battle. Also, I find the constant switching between Frodo and Sam and the battles annoying because it breaks up the battle scenes, jerking you out of the action just as it's starting to pull you in. RotK simply doesn't do a good enough job of making you \"feel\" the intensity of battle. Some movies can almost make you smell the blood, RotK doesn't achieve that, in fact there's hardly any blood at all and often just a lot of CGI (I guess the PG13 rating didn't help in that department). CGI has come far, but battle scenes are still vastly better with real people.\n\nAnyway, most of the movie is pretty good, but it never quite achieves \"lift off\" before it touches down on the ground again. As with the Matrix trilogy, the sequels just don't quite live up to the first, although I will say again that I think RotK is a good, although not brilliant, movie, and definitely better than Two Towers. There's no reason not to watch this film and I'm almost certain it won't be as good on DVD as it is on the big screen (mostly because the CGI and FX are so important), so go see it in a cinema while you have the chance. If you say this is the best movie you've ever seen, however (and it's almost a law of nature that some people will whenever a new LotR flick is out), I suggest you see some more movies. (Yes, I find all the LotR fanboys, and -girls, who uncritically love the movies with a zeal unmatched even by the most die-hard religious fundamentalists, extremely annoying)"

In time the film will look dated, but the story and characterisation far surpass that of Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back is the only one of the Star Wars films that is in the same league as LOR.\n\nAs with Two Towers, the Return of the King doesn't recap the story so far, so don't even think of seeing this film if you're unfamiliar with the story. It starts with a flashback to Smeagol and means Andy Serkis gets to appear on the finished print. Frodo, Sam and Smeagol then continue on their quest, whilst the remaining members of the fellowship are briefly reunited at Isengard before taking different paths to Minas Tirith.\n\nThe action is unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time is over 3 hours. As with the previous films the combination of sets, models and cgi brings middle earth to life.\n\nI suspect quite a few of the performers will be in with a chance of Oscar recognition. Miranda Otto is the stand out performer and is outstanding as Eowyn and surely deserves the Best Supporting Actress honour. I'm sure that Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Orlando Bloom will all have their supporters for acting honours and rightly so, as they all put in fine performances. I'm not sure whether Andy Serkis is elligable, but I suspect the success of Smeagol/Gollum owes as much to him as the animators. Bernhard Hill should also be in with a shout for recognition for his performance as King Theoden. My guess is that it'll miss out on the acting awards with the exception of Miranda Otto. It's absolutely certain to take Best Director, Best Picture and a string of technical awards though. My guess is that it will be nominated for about 12 categories and take 8 gongs.\n\nReturn of the King isn't flawless however. Saruman was cut entirely from the theatrical release of the film. We therefore missed out on the final face off between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard. This was certainly filmed and will no doubt be on the extended edition. When the Hobbits return to the Shire it looks remarkably like when they left. No sign that Saruman has arrived back before them and taken over. In the book Merry, Pippin, Sam and Frodo help rally the rest of the Hobbits to retake the Shire, but at some cost to both the hobbits and the environment. Merry, Pippin and Sam become heros to the rest of the hobbits who are largely unaware of Frodo's adventure and exploits. I'm not sure if any of this was shot, but it would be a welcome addition to the extended addition. Personally I would have followed Tolkien and got rid of 7 minutes of Arwen footage and kept Saruman in. Bearing in mind Christopher Lee's passion for the trilogy it is also sad to see him removed from the final episode. I'm quite sure Peter Jackson must have had a few sleepless nights over that decision.\n\nIf Saruman's exclusion was the biggest blunder of the film, Gimli's consignment to comic interlude was also a bit disappointing. I'm not against a bit of light hearted relief every so often, especially in such a long film, but it seemed that every time Gimli appeared on screen it was for light entertainment. The \"That still only counts as one\" line to Legolas was very funny though.\n\nDespite these gripes Peter Jackson can certainly be very proud of the Lord of the Rings. Very few people thought it possible to do justice to the book. He has crafted a film that many people will enjoy for many years."

Elves,orcs,trolls,hobbits,all these make up a charming atmosphere.\n\nThe idea of a Ring that can submit the will of it's bearer is surely unique is recalls all throughout the movie.Also, the love story between Aragorn and the immortal Arwen is the most original one seen in the entire history of movies. The fate of king Debethor reminds us of Greek tragedies and the film contains great moral learnings,most in the words of the wizard Gandalf.\n\nThe fantasy and the charming, sublime atmosphere make me consider this movie the greatest work or art ever created by mankind."

        "review_detailed_main": "In Return of the King - which follows the book (that I have not read, though heard what is in it that is not in the film) as close if not closer than the past two - co-writer/co-producer/director Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's grand tale of the quest to destroy the ring to an end. The story strands follow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with an equal worth in entertainment. Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor unfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and Pippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm of the terrors of Sauron.\n\nThere is much praise that should be given to Jackson and his crew/cast on not just the worth of Return of the King, but to what is now the entire saga of the Lord of the Rings as a whole. Though the film does carry quite a load to it (at three hours and twenty-one minutes it's the longest of the three in theatrical form, and it definitely does go on at least ten to fifteen minutes longer than it should), and expands and deflates on the details of some characters (i.e. Saruman is nowhere in sight in this version, while Arwen gets more than what is from the original work), there are plenty of rousing scenes and sequences, terrific battles, and a grasp on the visual effects as a whole that don't let up. In all, ROTK is on the level with Fellowship and Two Towers, making the parts as good as the whole. This is something that only several other filmmakers can make a claim to, that one film does not bring on a let down from the expectations that preceded it. It's the kind of film I'll want to see again, however it would be very difficult to sit through it in one place. Grade: A (both as a picture in and of itself, and overall on the three epics combined)"

Well, because the characters are already well-established and painted out on the screen by now, and the storyline is all chalked up. So everything was pitched for a homerun, and Peter Jackson did just that with \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\".\n\nThere is such an abundance of action in the movie that you just lean back and enjoy the ride. The battle scenes are massive and well-choreographed, and at times it even feels like you are there on the battlefield amidst men, hobbits and orcs yourself.\n\nNeedless to say that the sets, props and costumes are amazing here, just as they were in the previous two movies.\n\nThe performances of the cast were good, as they had been in the previous movies as well. And it has been a blast to follow the characters and watch them in the quests and endeavors on the screen. And they had an abundance of really great actors and actresses to perform the various roles and bring their characters to life on the scree.\n\nFor me this was a very full and wholeheartedly completion of the trilogy, one that had been so well lined up by Peter Jackson, and it delivered on all accounts.\n\nMy rating for \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" is a solid eight out of ten stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a movie virtuoso, I have seen nearly over hundreds of movies dating back as far as the mid 70's. However, it is sometimes difficult to find a movie out there that is worthy of anyone's 95 minutes of their day. With all the nonsense, exaggerated, repetitive, and culturally degrading pieces of work out in the movies today, I can come to agree with that. However, as many titles that may leave your eyes bleeding, there are some that leave not only your eyes, but your ears begging for more.\n\nIn Summer 2003, I was already impressed by the opening trailers to the icing of the ingenuity cake. I had no idea how much better the presentation really was until I walked into the theaters that Winter, only to be overwhelmed by the beautiful opening music as the title was being presented. 'The Return Of The King', focuses on many life ordeals at the same time keeping it's creative fantasy structure into perspective. Troubles such as betrayal, deception, disloyalty, greed, and malice are all shown in this work, showing how our lives can relate to a world so very different than reality.\n\nNot only did the flowing dialogue allow viewers to validate the setting similar to the medieval ages, but that the soundtrack used in this masterpiece was not only original, but absolutely beautiful and astonishing. The instrumentals along with the vocals throughout numerous scenes in the film, made it so much worth watching. It had almost been as if someone had made a visualization of an epic poem and combined it with an exciting and interest-grabbing plot.\n\nMy recommendation to this film is pretty strong. This film has definitely earned it's 11 academy awards as well as it's box office high. I can clearly say this film, inspired by Tolkien's brilliant novels, is one of the most exquisite and most beautiful pieces of literature turned into a pure illustrated masterpiece.\n\nBravo, Peter Jackson, bravo."

        "review_detailed_main": "Though certainly an improvement upon the second film in this already classic trilogy, I must say I am shocked that of all the incredible films I could name right off the top of my head that could be sitting in the fifth position in IMDb's list of Top 250 Highest Rated Films, this is the one that's sitting there. I know I'm quite tardy in my viewing of this movie, and I've known of its sky-high praise for the four or five years it's been in release, and I thought that even though the subject matter, as I explained in my reviews of the preceding two Lord of the Rings films, is not my cup of tea, I would see what everyone else sees in these movies. I was very fond of the first one, I was grateful when I saw the ending credits of the second one, and though I found myself entertained more than the second one by the third one, I was even more grateful when the final credits arrived. I will start with what I liked: The battle sequences in this film were much better than the ones in its predecessor. I thought the second film's battles were lame and this time around, they had a lot of intensity, and I found myself drawn in. Where I found myself riveted was during the climax, the fate of the ring to be determined on a coarse cliff over molting lava, and everything unexpected happens and all of the present characters in the scene have tension that finally culminates and releases, and I finally truly found myself caring about the ring, even if it doesn't make sense that Shalob can stink Frodo through a supposedly impermeable vest.\n\nBut now, let's get down to brass tacks about the denouement. I have never seen a movie that ends as many times as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After awhile, I was counting the \"final\" scenes. Counting! Then, I found myself shocked that I had given up on counting. Who counts endings to one movie? I cannot stand a badly paced film. I've always thought of directors like Peter Jackson as directors who are particularly good at keeping a brisk pace, no matter how long the movie is. But, not only do his endings lag in this single film, but they are plagued further by two horrible things: 1) Every time one ending closes, it fades out and the screen remains black for several seconds. Then it fades up again, having fooled you and the interest that causes you to stay with a film to the end has left. This happens every-single-time-the-movie-makes-you-think-it's-ending. 2) After awhile, this series of endings becomes intensely contrived and meaningless. We don't need to see most of the things that happen! And if Jackson still wants us to see what happens to these characters, as these things must in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, he should pace it better so that it does not feel stretched, tacked on, or contrived. Perfect way to achieve this: Get rid of the deceptive fade-outs!\n\nI enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and I suppose the last two films had their moments, but all I can say is that I am glad that I'm finished with this trilogy and that I don't have to worry about seeing them ever again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm beginning to agree with the viewers who remarked that this movie is overrated. Overrated, indeed. I have never been a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nI admit, the first movie was visually stunning and used some novel techniques for example, to make characters appear much larger than others as actors moved with the cameras to sustain the illusions. It was really something different that came out at the time, especially considering the number of awful movies produced in the mainstream that year, Lord of the Rings really found a good following in a period of utter cinematic slump (at least among the mainstream and partly in the independent features). I think those idiots at the Academy Awards were dumb to pass up recognizing it for one of the top awards that year, probably best director if nothing else. As the first in the series, I think it was given the best treatment as far as writing, visuals, and editing (which would be the bain of the remaining two in the trilogy), and everything else. Again, it was a refreshing change in mainstream films that year, and certainly one well-deserving of the recognition.\n\nBut the remaining two films, the Two Towers and now, Return of the King, were disappointing for one major reason: there was never enough in the movies (I don't know about the book) to sustain two movies at lengths of three hours or more each (not to mention the additional \"bonus\" footage feature on the DVDs). Someone here must've been so proud of their CGI creations and the time and money spent developing the sets that they must've felt like it was just bad manners to leave most of it on the cutting room floor. There is far too much repetition going on in the remaining too movies that could've easily have been made into one three hour film, rather than two.\n\nThe Two Towers spent an ungodly amount of time with those epic battle scenes between the billions and billions of Uruk soldiers and the few good-willed soldiers lead by Aragon and others. I found myself aching for the movie to be over with, and was sadly disappointed considering my interest in the first one. We are left with a story of fleeting interest: Sam and Frodo on their journey to toss the ring in the fire (though the introduction of Gollum, that ugly little bugger, was quite an interesting part of the story), Aragon and his gang were out to battle the relentless Uruk army, and Merry and Pippin literally got to be tree hugging hobbits. If the filmmakers didn't worry so much about pleasing the audience with epic CGI battle scenes and concentrated on developing each separate story of the various characters in their journies, it probably would've been a much better film. Although, considering that the third movie, 'Return of the King,' contained a nauseating amount of repetition as far as the story, and dragging on time with endless amounts of boring, dreamy dialogue and even more endless battle scenes, I still think it should've been combined into one movie.\n\nNot only endless dialogue of the fortune tellers and soothsayers, but also an ending that never seemed to end. Once again, it was like the filmmakers tried several things and liked every single ending and just stuck every single one in the movie, whether it was relevant or not (such as Sam and his hobbit daughters or the 'Wizard of Oz' ending where Elijah Wood puts on his queerest happy voice as he greets his friends 'round the bedside). The viewer who suggested that they should of ended it after the coronation was right, there was no need to drag on the movie for another half-hour of fade-ins and fade-outs of one happy ending after the next, as they did enough stalling throughout most of the movies, anyways.\n\nReturn of the King is definitely overrated and was hardly deserving of the 'Best Picture' Oscar, nor for every other Oscar it snagged this year, leaving little to be anticipated during the awards knowing that the Lord of the Rings team would win whatever award was announced. The Academy was stupid for not recognizing it with top awards the first time around, and instead, waited for the third anti-climatic cult fest to finally give Jackson and his crew their dues. There were far better movies nominated for Best Picture and nearly every other award this year (save the special effects nominations).\n\nOnce again, though, I do think that Peter Jackson and his crew did good with their efforts to recreate Tolkein's stories cinematically. That kind of undertaking for a trilogy filmed simultaneously over 18 months is quite incredible. I just though that, save for the Fellowhip of the Rings, the filmmakers failed to capitalize on the things that would've made the remaining two films in the trilogy something really great, especially if they weren't so bogged down in special effects and cheesy dialogue."

Denethor doesn't have the best attitude in the world, such as when he tries to burn his own son alive.\n\nThe ending is very long, but it isn't bad.

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't talk about the film as much as I want, I'm afraid I wouldn't get the name rights, the locations or the characters who weren't there from the start, I'm even afraid some events or scenes escaped my attention, but I know I love poetry, and the last twenty minutes reminded of these words from Du Bellay.\n\n\"Happy the man who, journeying far and wide As Jason or Ulysses did, can then Turn homeward, seasoned in the ways of men, And claim his own, and there in peace abide!\"\n\nThis is one of the most famous verses of French Renaissance and I can't think of a movie that captures the innermost joy and relief of homecoming as the third and final installment of the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy did. Even the title carries this regal glory and satisfyingly conclusive nature.\n\nAnd through this \"Return of the King\", Aragorn, to name him, also ends the journey of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Gollum and so many names that, two years earlier, could only -no pun intended- ring a bell among Tolkien's readers. I know they were many of them as we're talking of the most outstanding work of fiction from the second half the 20th century, but I suspect Peter Jackson multiplied the number of fans by a two-digit number, with a cinematic wizardry of Gandalfian proportions. Extending my statement about Jackson in the first film's review, there's indeed more than a hobbit within the New Zealand director.\n\nBut for honesty's sake, and not to spoil my enthusiasm, I must confess I never read Tolkien's books, I've never been into medieval and Fantasy world anyway, although I know the story wasn't intended to venture in the realm of magic and fantasy alone. I enjoyed the first movie because it pushed me into a world daringly unique and imaginative, but so obsessed with its own reality that it almost confined to realism. More than the plot, I cared for the characters, because they seemed \"to have a story before the story\", they were not cardboard heroes or villains; they were archetypal but never at the expense of depth and obscurity.\n\nDespite these strengths, I welcomed the second film with perplexity because the surprise was gone and the entertaining value was inevitably hanging on the set-ups from the first film and the expectation of the third, situations that were no-more or that were yet-to-come. Unlike its two predecessors, the final film is great on its own. Everything has been said about the visual imagery and on that level, with the magnificent shots, battle sequences and that defining image of Gandalf the Grey arriving at Minas Tirith, Jackson really pushed the envelope and broke new grounds in the field of special effects, CGI wouldn't be a curse word anymore. But all the sets of skills in the world wouldn't amount to anything without a story.\n\nIndeed, I was surprised by how moving the final act was. The last thirty minutes of \"The Return of the King\" provided some of the most emotional moments of the last twenty years, something whose resonance transcends the limits of the Fantasy genre. And that's an even greater achievement than special effects, Jackson had created characters who had their own special effect, built over the course of two movies, that equals the lengths of three actually, allowed us to get emotionally involved with them. I compared Gandalf with Obi-Wan in the first opus' review but he doesn't deserve any comparison, he's in a class of his own. The bravery of Aragorn, the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, the torment of Gollum and of course, the friendship between Sam and Frodo could finally culminate.\n\nAnd in this glorious gallery, Sam is perhaps the unsung hero of the film because he suffered no fear or hesitation, he was Frodo's guardian angel with unshakable loyalty from beginning to end, and never let his ego trespass in his sense of duty. Of all the characters, this is the one I had a soft spot on, and from the ending, I have the feeling, this is what the long epilogue was trying to convey as without him, all the battles and desperate efforts would have lead to nowhere\u0085 and forget about the ring, his smile and satisfaction in the end, is perhaps the true emotional reward. Indeed, the Ring was only a plot-driver, the film is about people, who overcome the adversity and come full circle with their own personalities, who seek for the peace of the world, for their own peace's sake.\n\nAnd what a price for peace! What a magnificent journey coming to an end, and what a satisfying ending! The first two films ended with interrogation marks, with an urge to see more, there was excitement, but an excitement pending over the reception of the next opus, undermined by the uncertainty. This film closes the chapter and leaves with overwhelming emotions and inner satisfaction; it is a \"The End\" in the tradition of Hollywood epics. And this glorious finale redeems all the flaws or the little imprecision from the first, all the removed chapters or cut sections.\n\nSpeaking of Hollywood, the film is also known for being the third to get eleven Oscars (including Best Picture) with other classics like \"Ben Hur\" and \"Titanic\" I guess it is the reward of the whole trilogy, whose last opus was the apotheosis, something that proved that cinema had this unique capability to transport you into a world where imagination and reality made one. And Peter Jackson is one name to be chanted by the bards of the \"Lord of the Rings\" Pantheon, for he ensured the popularity of the saga, by translating it into a new language, a new medium. This was a Herculean task that the third hobbit, third wizard, third cinematic genius marvelously accomplished\u0085 for one of the best cinematic thirds ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not just the conclusion of a trilogy; it is a breathtaking culmination of an epic journey that resonates deeply within the human spirit. Peter Jackson's masterful direction and the creative prowess behind this cinematic odyssey bring to life J. R. Tolkien's timeless tale of courage, sacrifice, and the persistent glimmer of hope amid despair.\n\nThe Return of the King envelops the audience in a tapestry of emotion and grandeur. The film's scope is staggering, drawing viewers into the climactic battle for the fate of Middle-earth. The sheer scale of the battles, particularly the Siege of Minas Tirith, is both a technical marvel and a poignant reflection of the struggle between light and darkness. Each clash of swords and every charging cavalry echo the weight of choices made, reminding us that heroism isn't just about valor on the battlefield, but also the relentless fight against the encroaching shadows of despair.\n\nAt its heart, The Return of the King is a profound exploration of friendship and loyalty. The evolving dynamics among Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are a testament to the bonds that can illuminate even the bleakest of paths. Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee is, without question, one of the most moving performances in cinematic history. His unwavering loyalty and heartfelt determination to support Frodo through the darkness encapsulate the very essence of what it means to be a true friend.\n\nThe film also brilliantly weaves in themes of redemption and sacrifice. Characters like Aragorn step into their destinies with stunning grace, while others confront their own demons, exemplifying the notion that true strength often lies in vulnerability. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Aragorn is a masterclass in embodying a reluctant hero, bringing forth an emotional depth that resonates through every moment of conflict and resolution.\n\nThe Return of the King is nothing short of a masterpiece. Each shot is meticulously crafted, showcasing the vast landscapes of Middle-earth-each location imbued with its own unique story and history. Howard Shore's sweeping score elevates every scene, stirring emotions and evoking the gravitas of the moment, leaving audiences breathless as the powerful themes reach their zenith.\n\nAs the film reaches its conclusion, viewers are reminded that even the smallest person can change the course of the future. Frodo's journey culminates in a bittersweet farewell, encapsulating the essence of sacrifice and the cost of carrying an enormous burden-a theme that lingers long after the credits roll.\n\nIn the end, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not just a film; it is an experience that encapsulates the triumph of hope over despair, the power of friendship, and the beauty of sacrifice. It is an artistic achievement that will be celebrated for generations, a poignant reminder that even in our darkest hours, the light of courage and love can lead us home. This film stands as a glorious testament to the resilience of the human spirit, forever etched in the hearts of those who dare to dream of a better world."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is hard to make a fair review based on the shortened version of the movie but I will give it a try.\n\nFirst of all I want to praise the team behind the CGI and especially that of Gollum which is nothing short of perfect. The sound FX crew, costume designers, smiths, makeup artists, sculptors etc are all worthy of praise as well.\n\nUnfortunately, all is not well in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth. Many important characters are ill adapted, ill casted and perverted.\n\nTake Aragorn for instance, who in the book is a tall, proud and weather bitten man with many hard years of life carved into his body and features; a descendant of kings with great claims to make. In the movies he is of average height, narrow of shoulders and weak of limb, judging from how he moves. His face does not carry the slightest trait of a hard life and his manners are soft and his voice is weak.\n\nTake Gimli who in the book is a great dwarven warrior with a passion for hollow halls of stone. In the movies he is perverted into a comic relief character who moves nearly as poorly as a \"real\" dwarf.\n\nTake the Ringwraiths who in the book are imposing figures with dark powers that make their enemies shake with fear. In the movies they are a bunch of sissies who get their asses whooped time and again while actively seeking physical confrontations.\n\nTake the elves, who ought to be timeless and beautiful beyond words. In the movies they look ordinary and nearly ugly at times.\n\nTake the Orcs who ought to be fearful and cruel warriors with their own cultures, languages and conflicts. In the movies, they are killed as easily as bugs and they move as if they were 100 years old and moreover they do not show off any soul or will of their own.\n\nI could go on and on forever with a list of such poor adaptations but will end it here. The point is that fantasy is very much about the individuals who inhabit the world and how some are of greater power and stature than others. This is something which Peter Jackson has not managed to bring to the screen visually at all.\n\nWhat he on the other hand has brought to the screen visually is Sauron himself: the greatest power and fear of Tolkien's Middle Earth compressed into first a mail clad warrior and then a burning vagina revolving on top of Barad D\u00fcr like a search light. Whether to laugh or cry at this adaptation is up to the viewer. It is pretty much the abc of horror that what you can imagine is a lot more scary than what you can actually see. And this brings us to my next point, the aurals:\n\nIt can never be stated too many times how important the aurals are for bringing a world to life and drawing the viewer into it. While the sound effects are very well crafted in Peter Jackson's LOTR, the music is not. In fact, the music is so poorly fitting that it spoils the entire experience. It is too ethereal and carries no dynamics or inspiring rythms and where it tries to do so it is more of a turn off than whatever crap the standard radio station is playing. It is altogether pretentious and the only feeling it successfully conveys is melancholy.\n\nAnother thing that strikes me is how empty the world is. No wild life, no natural beauty but bare mountains, no hamlets or buildings outside of the cities, no roads, hardly any traits of the civilizations of old and no agricultural signs at all except in the Shire. A few cities and the rest is wasteland.\n\nThe movies can be summarized as technical master pieces but ill adapted, ill casted and musically disastrous."

In time, all three of these movies will take their rightful place in film history...oblivion.\n\nI can't understand how people can equate special effects with great film making. There's really nothing positive that I can say about these movies except that the special effects were at first stunning. Soon their repetitiveness led to utter boredom.\n\nI would much rather watch a film about realistic situations that people can actually relate to. But I guess if you spent your entire life playing video games and watching other special effects based movies like these, then these movies would qualify as the greatest ever.\n\nSomeone made the comment that this movie was better than Citizen Kane. Watch this movie as many times as Citizen Kane and see which holds up better. Believe me, this whole trilogy will be a fading memory in ten or twenty years and Citizen Kane will continue to be praised. This is just another case of the 'dumbing down' of the culture. These same people probably can't wait until the next Superbowl so they can watch the commercials.\n\nI generously gave all three movies of this trilogy a 5/10."

What an event it was...\n\nFrom the stunning opening scene (simple yet effective) Peter Jackson plays out all his cards in this final chapter. The epic wars are bigger, meaner, and longer (Helms Deep will now look like a fun afternoon in at playground), and then there's \"that\" climax. Jackson always said that the 3rd part was his favorite and everyone will agree. He puts the most difficult scenes together with nothing but flair & skill, sometimes he goes a bit \"over the top\" which adds some humour and a modern touch. At the actor front, one is in top-form: Bernard Hill. This great actor plays the part of his life. A supporting actor Oscar should be his reward. As said before in other reviews, the music is first rate, as are all the other things: cinematography, art-direction, costumes, editing, CGI-FX.....etcetera.\n\nMy verdict is clear: for 20 years, since I saw Return of the Jedi aged 7, movies are my life. I've been known to be very critic, so when I say that this movie is the best I've ever seen; I'm not exaggerating. The other 2 parts have been at the top of my all time favorites (along with the StarWars saga), but this one tops them all.\n\nI'm glad that as a fan of the book since 1991, I've been able to experience this. A movie to cherish, for the rest of your life."

Peter Jackson will go down as one of the greatest Producer/Director of all time. So many times we see great books series butchered on the big screen, but not this time. This is 2nd best movie series of all time, the only reason its not first is because Star Wars wasn't a book before the movies which made it a little harder to make. But if you are just looking at how well each movie was it is the best series of all time.\n\nIm not gonna go into much detail because I feel like a review on here should just let the person that is reading it know if the movie is good or not. If you have seen the first 2 than get ready to be blown away. Finally you get to see what happens to the ring and all the characters responsible for getting the ring to the place they can destroy it. Will they get there? If they do will they lose anybody else? What happens? Trust me watch this movie, along with all of your questions being answered you will also witness one of the greatest movies ever if not the greatest."

You just don't see grown friends crying in each other's arms anymore! The sharp distinction of good and evil, which doesn't exist in today's movies anymore, was writ large. I also liked the portrayal of the evil Lord Sauron and his hideous Orcs cutting down forests and making weapons in their macabre caverns as a metaphor for the industrial destruction of our modern world.\n\nBut good wins! And this was a magnificent and fitting end to one of the most epic movie franchises ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tolkien's works were adapted for TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi brought the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level as a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart, a bit of humour, heart-thumping action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars: Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, and Liv Tyler.\n\nIn this adrenaline-rushing conclusion of our adventure, the War of the Ring has begun, and Frodo and Sam (who are led by Gollum) continue their dangerous quest to destroy the One Ring. But they are unaware of the trap that was set for them by Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf united with Merry and Pippin at the now-destroyed Isengard, thanks to Treebeard and the other Ents. Now the friends celebrated their victory, but Aragorn was worried about Frodo. And in the dead of the night, Pippin snuck out of bed to take a peek at Saruman's palantir, which had been found and confiscated. But then something happened: the palantir revealed The Eye of Sauron and his plans to attack Minas Tirith, so Gandalf took Pippin and rode to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, on the road to the ships that will take elves away from Middle Earth, Arwen was thinking over her choice of path. Until a vision of her son convinces her to return home. So she rode home and begged her father to resurrect Narsil's ancient blade and give it to her beloved Aragorn, so he could become the king he was born to be.\n\nSo overall, all three films are excellent. And you know, I do feel sorry for Faramir for being the unappreciated son; I mean, it was his big brother Boromir who was their dad's favorite. I love the friendship that is developing between Merry and Eowyn. And I love the end-title song performed by Annie Lennox."

The very same phenomenon exists in the world of literature as well, to name an example; the \"Gormenghast\"-trilogy.\n\nWhy is this? It is probably not possible to arrive at a complete answer, but one possible solution is obvious. Firstly, Jackson must have been exhausted from making the two previous movies. Making cinema at the highest level is very hard work, and especially so for a director so closely interwoven with all aspects of the production. I believe he simply lost his concentration. A few of the obvious weak points of the movie should have been rooted out on an early stage. The fact that they weren't indicate a lack of the control Jackson exercised over LOTR I and II, in particular over the script. The story in the most complicated part of LOTR, near the very end, is so appallingly bad that many in the audience felt embarrassed for their interest int the trilogy as a whole. Now, Mr. Jackson isn't solely to blame for it all. Everyone who has read LOTR know that Tolkien also very much messed up the story at the end. Being a no more than mediocre writer he simply lacked the experience to round off the story in a fashion that suited the mammoth amount of verbiage leading up to the final battle. The predominant problem is that neither Jackson, who could have rewritten the end, or Tolkien offer anything new or remotely exciting. Instead they rehash the battle at Helm's deep. And, after many hours of careful storytelling, Jackson's heroes stumbles, out of nowhere, upon the \"Deus I'm machina\", an animated phosphorous-green army of semi-transparent ghouls. These specters, horribly reminiscent of \"the Judge\" from Jackson's flop \"The Frighteners\" save the day. The importance of these undead crusaders is inexplicably exaggerated by Walsh and Jackson. In addition, the digital effect used to create the army reminds one of a commercial for soap, a green blob magically swooping away the dirt. Visually, Jackson tendency to rely too much on digital effects was his downfall. It really isn't necessary to add that the final scenes was rather pathetic, a reminder that Tolkien dodged complex emotions for a very good reason. The supposedly bitter-sweet goodbye at the dock is drenched in golden light, no doubt added digitally, and adds the last touch of defeat to this great disappointment.\n\nI rate this movie: 2/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This review is about the entire trilogy\n\nI have long thought whether, and if so, how to begin a review about \"The Lord of the Rings\". Because there is probably no story that means more to me and where it is so difficult for me to be objective. I actually came across the story quite late, in 2012. I saw \"The Hobbit\" and even though, in retrospect, \"An Unexpected Journey\" doesn't come close to \"The Lord of the Rings\" in any way, the world still captivated me so much that I really wanted to see more. That very same day I bought the Trilogy-Bluray-Box and, what can I say, watched it in one go. Those almost twelve hours were a revelation. One day later I got the book and read it within a day. Today, eight years later, I like to boast that I have acquired a comprehensive knowledge of middle earth. Above my couch hangs Anduril- Flame of the West, my forearm is adorned with a Tolkien tattoo, every now and then I say a few sentences in Elvish and all my savings go into my next visit to New Zealand. I find it hard to describe what fascinates me about this story. Among other things, for me it is the pure embodiment of the magic of cinema. It is a sensitive commodity and the more the global event cinema takes hold, the more it seems to disappear. But the magic in this case is by no means based solely on the infamous budget of 300 million dollar. Among other things, it is the realistic and consistent depiction on Tolkiens world, almost like an alternative historiography. Peter Jacksons belief in a higher task and his awareness that he must not disappoint millions of Tolkien fans made this mammoth project possible in the first place. And the result is known: the fans would have rather missed Christmas than the new \"Lord of the Rings\" movie. With each film the panoramas became more splendid, the details more loving, the battles more impressive, the moments more intense; Peter Jackson brought Tolkiens unique world truly to life. The New York Times summed it up perfectly: \"Never before has anyone seen a film whose director pays such a high level of respect to the literary source. Jackson puts all his skills at the service of this reference- and he succeeds in creating the extremely rare, one might say, perfect connection between filmmaker and source material.\" Although the effects alone are not the only reason for the magic of the films, \"The Lord of the Rings\" would be unthinkable without them. Only the solely digital Gollum, which steals the show in the second part, and the fighting armies in epic battles ensure the impressive physique. But it is the mixture of the special effects and the impressive props and sets that gives the series its unique aesthetic. This multifaceted world is held together by a skilful editing and excellent camera work. The clever cliffhanger structure ensures that the viewer follows the scattered companions spellbound, repeatedly interrupted by picturesque landscapes. In the end, it seems as if one has absorbed all the splendor of Middle Earth. And here is a significant difference to other sagas like Star Wars, Harry Potter or Marvel's Infinity Saga: Tolkiens World cannot be expanded at will. The great cast should of course not go unmentioned. How many actors became icons of pop culture through their roles in the trilogy, still today. And of course, Howard Shore made a decisive contribution with his unsurpassed score. Whenever I listen to \"Concerning Hobbits\", it feels like home. However, for all the points mentioned, the heart of this film series is the story. The peaceful world of the hobbits is in many ways like my own home. And the threat posed by the all-powerful Sauron is always tangible. \"The Lord of the Rings\" tells the essential story of the fight of good against evil, the smallest must defeat the biggest. It is a story of probation. Ever new experiences and losses make the heroes wiser, and also sadder. At first glance, \"The Lord of the Rings\" seems to be an extremely dark story, but it is also full of hope. Aragorn and Arwen have shown me the essence of love; Frodo and Sam, what true friendship means; Gandalf, that there is no need to fear death. With all the seemingly overpowering evil, belief in good is always preserved; the faith that ultimately helps the heroes to victory. The fateful importance of the individual becomes a topic, as does the importance of social cohesion in difficult times. The mythical structure, with its alternation between epic and intimate moments, seems like a modern \"Iliad\", for some even like a modern Bible- like for me. Under Peter Jacksons direction, three of the best films of all time were made, and for that he and the entire team will forever have my gratitude and the gratitude of many other fans.\n\n\"Sam: I know, by rights we shouldn't even be here. Just hold on. It's like in the great stories Mr Frodo, the ones that really matter. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes, you don't even want to know the ending, because how can the end be happy? How can the world go back to the way it was when so much BAD had happened? But in the end, it's just a passing thing, this darkness, and even darkness must pass. And a new day will come, and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those are the stroies that really matter, that mean something, even if you were to small to understand why. But I think Mr Frodo, I know now. Folk in those stories, they had lots of chances to turn back, only they didn't. They kept going, because they were holding on to something. Frodo: What are we holding on to Sam? Sam: There's some good in this world, Mr Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.\""

The fight with Shelob, the rescue from Cirith Ungol, the Siege of Minas Tirith, the crossing of the plains of Mordor, and the destruction of the RING. ALL HERE!!! All amazing!\n\nThere can be said nothing negative of this film. I was absolutely blown away in the theater. The Siege was done so well and is one of the best action scenes ever. Also, the end was amazing. The book dragged on a bit with the Shire and Saruman, but none of that is here. The destruction of the Ring destroys all evil, like it should! And the sequence when the Army of Gondor is at the Black Gate and Frodo, with Sam and Smeagol, are in Mount Doom is absolutely jaw dropping. The music, Aragorn's speech (almost like Henry V), and the action are a terrific culmination and serve as a truly breath-taking climax.\n\nHowever the film amazingly well done overall and easily the best out of the trilogy. The crew behind this film worked their butts of as there is no sign of sloppiness. It is all very well done, from beginning to end and it provides an awesome end to a great trilogy. 10/10"

Darkness spreads and all hope seems to wane, for even if the diminishing strength of Men were to prevail against crushing odds, their fate rests on the shoulders of a hobbit, the smallest of beings.\n\nThe Return of the King is an epic conclusion to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. All the individual plot lines come crashing together as we witness the last great battle between the forces of good and evil. This is grand fantasy at its finest. Every time you're allowed to draw breath and every time you hold your breath in fear and terror, there's something new and even more majestic waiting to reveal itself. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields in front of Minas Tirith is probably the finest individual battle scene I've ever seen put on film. An opinion shared by many. And the thing is, it has aged remarkably well. Here and there you can spot the use of CGI, but not often. I've seen big budget movies this year, full twelve years later, which look noticeably worse than this film in that regard.\n\nI also really like how the scale shows not just in battle scenes but in every other aspect as well. The dialogues are full of emotions, great speeches, deep feelings, talks about fate, the elusiveness of hope, the strength of belief. Sure, it's escapism, but at its finest. This movie is the prime example of why we still tell stories to ourselves.\n\nAnd yeah, I'm the first to admit that this is the most flawed film in the trilogy. They have turned Gimli into a complete joke character at this point. There are perhaps one or two endings too many. The ghost army subplot comes a bit out of nowhere. The emotions do boil over a touch too much. But in the end, I still love this film and this world. It is an archetype, an ideal against which all alike stories are measured.\n\nThe Return of the King is my least favourite film in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's still easily one of my favourite movies, one of the finest epic movies ever made and more than worthy of all its praise."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK. First of all, this movie cannot be considered the best movie of all time because of many things. I've read almost every comments on this site about this movie (and i dont exaggerate at all) and all i saw was \" Best movie of all time\", \" The way movies should be done today\", etc, and i thought wait a minute, there's something wrong here. Before anyone becomes insulted by what im saying i have to say that i've read all the books and i loved them. The best trilogy in books history!! But here, what im arguing against is not the story nor the way Jackson adapted it( by the way, it couldn't be much perfect for a lotr movie). I'm just outraged by the ignorance of all the people that are stating that this is the best movie of all time!!! I certainly do not say these people are stupid or something like that, its just that this is not a work of art, a masterpiece. It is just another commercial movie that looks like the others and this movie happens to be based on the most popular books of all time ( i do not know anybody who havent red the books). All the battles have already been done th same way (See every movie categorized as peplum in the 50, 60s and 70s and you'll understand), the close shots of thes characters faces are nothing new and the narrative form is as simple as \"The Beauty and the Beast\" story. If you want to watch movies that are made by real artists and not by a lucky director of B-Series movies, check out Leos Karax, Jean-Luc Godard, Gus Van Sant, Stanley Kubrick, Tim Burton, Fritz Lang, Milos Forman, Francois Truffaut, Orson Welles, etc. Watch out, i do not say that everybody would like every one of these but i surely think that in the directors i've named, you'll find one that made a movie that'll make you cry, smile or feel fear better than a ordinary epic commercial movie as the Return of the King. In the end, i would also like to say that i liked the first two movies (as they amused me for three hours each) but i thought that the third one was a pale copy of the FOTR and TTT."

However, this movie had no story just as so many critics have stated about Tolkien's trilogy (please check the reception history of Tolkien's novels if you don't believe me-- I teach English). Tolkien was a mediocre writer at best and this trilogy translates into a mediocre bore-fest. I have never seen more effort put into such a boring story. Tolkien's 3 tomes could have been summed up in about five paragraphs but it seems that Peter Jackson is just as long winded as JRR. These three films have about enough story material to make an interesting short film. Jorge Luis Borges would have been horrified to see such a travesty of pointless, long-winded storytelling."

        "review_detailed_main": "So I have now made my way through The Lord Of The Rings trilogy and that culminates with The Return Of The King, one of the biggest films ever made and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the forces of Gondor & Rohan fight to protect Middle Earth from the forces of Mordor while Frodo, Sam & Gollum get closer to Mount Doom and their endgame.\n\nMain Character Elijah Wood is back as Frodo and I think he does a great job in selling just how tough the journey has been on Frodo compared to the other characters. The ring is just weighing him down and this film in particular he is really struggling with it and finding his mind on the brink. I mean Frodo isn't the most likeable character for parts of this film but I thought Wood did a great job in portraying the anxiety and torment that Frodo has gone through in this trilogy. Viggo Mortenson plays Aragorn and talking about his character is pretty funny, I mean the title of the film spoils his whole character arc but he is still great here and does well in his role and just does a great job as a protagonist.\n\nSupporting Characters Sean Astin does a really good job in the first two films but this is the film where he really stands out and for me gives the best performance in the film. There is a line in The Two Towers where Frodo says he wouldn't get far without Sam and you really see it in this film, as Frodo struggles Sam gets stronger and Astin does a fantastic job in this film as the moral centre. Sir Ian McKellen is given more to do here as Gandalf The White and he is great, he gets to see more of the action and nails every moment he is on screen and just adds so much to the film. Andy Serkis is also back as Gollum and the effects are even better here, Gollum looks fantastic and the character is fleshed out here and it even better, Serkis truly deserves credit for his role here and Gollum is also a real highlight of the film. The rest of the cast also do great jobs, Miranda Otto as Eowyn gets more to do here, Bernard Hill as Theoden gets more to do, Merry and Pippin have more to do and they are all fantastic and have really good character arcs, the whole cast really do a great job in the film.\n\nStory The story is epic on all levels, more of the characters have interesting character arcs and more time to shine. The story is in three plots really, Frodo, Sam & Gollum, Gandalf & Pippin and the rest of the characters at Rohan, and all of it is really interesting. The film uses its extra runtime to flesh out more characters and makes the story be more epic and have more depth to it then the previous films. It ends the trilogy pretty much perfectly and does it really well with these characters that you will have grown to love over the 9 hours that you have watched.\n\nScript The script is great, the dialogue and ways the characters are written takes these larger then life personalities and makes you care about them which is no mean feat. This film knows when to focus on the drama and it knows when to have a laugh, it balances the plot arcs very well and makes the film interesting from start to end.\n\nStyle This film is epic on scale, I mean it could be argued that in terms of scale this is the largest film ever, the battle scenes are huge in scale and raises the scale which was necessary for a final instalment of this epic franchise. The film has over 3 hours to tell its story and I think it does a good job of it and keeps the pacing high for pretty much the entire film which is a difficult thing to do.\n\nOverall Overall, I mean this is The Return Of The King so of course it is amazing, this whole trilogy is one of the greatest of all time and if people haven't watched it then they just need to get on it, especially while we are in lockdown.\n\nRating - 10/10."

The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era.

        "review_detailed_main": "First, let me say that I did like \"Return of the King.\" It's a special effects masterpiece that is destined to become a classic, along with the first two installments in the \"Lord of the Rings\" saga.\n\nBut, to me, it was far less enjoyable than the first two films, the second of which was the best of the three.\n\n\"King\" was far too long for what it had to say. And the ending (or should I say endings) really disappointed me. I kept waiting for the film to end, but it just kept going on and on. There were at least four times that I thought the film was over, but then the next scene would fade in. It would have been a much better ending if the film had finished with the resolution of the final battle, and then showed the denouement as a montage next to the closing credits. It would have removed about 20 minutes from the overly-lengthy film and would have made the ending less of a \"cut-and-paste\" style.\n\nSo I'll give it a solid 7. But to me, it has been seriously over-rated by both fans and critics. I'm surprised that more of the critics, at least, haven't picked up on the weak ending."

The Return of the King barely exhibited the epic quantity that I awaited from the finale of the trilogy. It seems that by this time, the whole crew was tired of the project. Also, the omissions and changes to Tolkien's original are most glaring in RotK. The movie just whizzed by and I failed to be impressed. Maybe the Extended Edition would prove to be a more rousing experience. The normal edition, however, despite its efforts, remains a lacking ho-hum finale to what began as an impressive filmatization of the Lord of the Rings tale."

But now regard it as pure perfection. I don't think a film series can be beaten for music, script or acting. It's masterful in all three. I think we can forgive Jackson for the few directing failings along the way, the. Man had a lot on his plate lol. But seriously I'll be watching these films forever. Simply The GOAT. If you don't love these movies then you seriously have no soul. And if you've read the books you'll know that it was a near impossibly task to make them at all. Jackson has pulled of the seemingly impossible."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's very rare for the third film in a series to be good but The Return of the King has surpassed that and managed to become the best film in the LOTR trilogy.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King shows Aragorn, Gandalf and the rest of the Fellowship getting ready to fight Sauron's army whilst Frodo and Sam approach Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring once and for all.\n\nIt has all led to this. A 3 hour and 20 minute finale to end the Lord of the Rings story and it couldn't be better. This is my favourite out of all three films as I believe Peter Jackson has crafted one of the best finales to a film ever. It's amazing how much effort and work has gone into this trilogy as this film wouldn't have the same impact if the previous two weren't planned so well. All three films have such a fantastic connection with one another. A huge amount of credit goes to the entire team working on all three films.\n\nThe Return of the King is the best one as this one ups the ante. If you thought the battle at the end of The Two Towers was impressive, the battle in this film is breathtaking. The fabulous camerawork, special effects and magnitude of the fight makes this a cinematic achievement. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and Howard Shore's epic score increases the intensity of the fight. I was in complete awe as nothing of this scale has been done before. I'm so happy the Academy recognised the work put into it.\n\nIt's not just the fights that make this film perfect but the characters are fully developed here and given great closure. This film brings the most development to the Hobbits especially Pippin, Frodo and Sam. Pippin really grows in this film after realising what's going on and Billy Boyd did an excellent job. The friendship between Frodo and Sam developed so much here. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin were so good. Once again each actor shines and give outstanding performances.\n\nWith The Return of the King, Peter Jackson has successfully created a perfect and memorable trilogy that set a new standard for filmmaking. Each scene builds up to an epic finale and ending that may make you cry. J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud!"

You more or less generally know how it's going to turn out anyway (good guys will get their butts kicked a few times, but will prevail after many long, tedious battles later), so I guess I can't blame the film for delivering exactly what I expected in a final chapter, but I guess I found the journey to get there (first two movies) far more interesting than the end result. After a while, all the eye candy of CGI-created battles gets a bit tiring to look at.\n\nSo I'll give it a 10 for craftsmanship and artistry, but a 7 for holding my interest."

The special effects are incredible, the...um...No, I think that's about it.\n\nBefore I go any further, let me state I am an admirer of Tolkien's work, and this review will be largely biased because of that. The breadth and scope of 'The Lord of the Rings' amazes me every time I pick up the novel. The character dialogue is long, eloquent, and puts the reader in a grander time and place than his own. The story is about traveling with friends, talking over dinner, and exploring a world unlike anywhere else in literature. But Jackson's movie has very little of any of that.\n\nI understand that because of the cost of the movie, he had to adjust it for mainstream audiences. However, the problem is not that he adjusted the material, but that he absolutely butchered it. Tolkien's beautiful dialogue is trimmed down and thrown away to be replaced by bad one-liners and soap opera scenes. The characters feel one-dimensional and act like cardboard cut outs of their alter egos in the book. Does Frodo panting or groaning or complaining for the hundredth time tell me anything about him or why I should care that he's panting and groaning, etc?\n\nI don't hate everything about Jackson's interpretation. I enjoyed the wonderful sets, realistic cgi, and thrilling battle scenes. But was it necessary to make the Battle of Plennor Fields an hour long computer simulate scrimmage when Tolkien spends only a single page describing it in his book? It's a pity mainstream audiences have swallowed the movie and accepted it as a masterpiece, when really it's nothing of the sort. It's a real shame."

An unforgettable grand-scale epic.\n\n\"This is it\", director Peter Jackson might have said. \"This is the film where the name Peter Jackson will be remembered for.\" Indeed, it is. The phrase \"Save the best for last\" has never been so evident. And not since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK have we had a sequel that outdoes an original that is too powerful to defeat. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING is a sequel the third movie in the series of adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's bestselling novels including THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS, two very strong box-office hits that aren't easily topped from the highest spot. But, surprisingly, it was (by this film, no less). But still, all three films act like one big epic of a movie that's just plain beautiful, exciting and enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe film continues the events where THE TWO TOWERS left off, having not much separate characters to focus on. This time, it only have the escapades of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood, companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum/Smeagol (voiced by Andy Serkis) on their quest for the gates of Mordor and continue their mission to destroy the One Ring. On the other end, we have Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and the people of Rohan fighting for glory against the forces of Mordor who has besieged the capital city of Gondor, ruled by a treacherous ruler (John Noble), a typical stereotype of a cowardly ruler.\n\nDirector (Jackson) doesn't disappoint the fans he has earned with the series he created. Of course he shows new special-effects advancements in the brilliant battle sequences, lots of creative creatures and outlandish settings, but he also keeps a strong direction, brilliant performances from the cast and other stylish works behind the camera. Films like this come ones in a full moon, but Jackson does such a great job, he succeeds to make such a rare and min-blowing achievement.\n\nHere I am, brainstorming one of the best films of the last few years and I'll make sure that the LOTR series is there, with THE RETURN OF THE KING on the top spot of the entire series.\n\nRating: ***** out of 5."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I review this good movie, I have to get something that's been bothering me off my chest.\n\nI went with eight people to see \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\" All eight of them found it \"good\" at best. We all thought it was too long, with too many passages of dialogue explaining what was going to happen (\"I ride to Minis Tirith at dawn to face the enemies of Middle-Earth!\" -- just do it already!), too many scenes that most definitely could have been cut or edited, and we all found that the ending of the film stretched on too long and we didn't need to see Frodo and Sam fondly gazing at each other ninety times before we got the idea that they have an affection for each other. (Brotherly love or...something else?)\n\nThe thing is, all the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies are good. But none of them are great. Filmed by Peter Jackson with an epic feeling that betrays J.R.R. Tolkien's light-hearted tale, the films try to take a somewhat light idea and turn them into epics -- a problem, since the entire world is fantasy, and it is hard to take anything in the film dreadfully serious. (I thought it was just I, but some other critics have noted the same problem.)\n\nThis is the best \"Lord of the Rings\" movie. Even though it sounds as if I am complaining about them, I am not. I'm complaining about the way movie geeks flock to the cinemas and spread word that it's the \"best film of all time,\" then post these comments on the Internet and try to boost the film's rating on IMDb. (Some fans have been caught in the act of making multiple usernames to do so.)\n\nI find it almost laughable that anyone could argue that the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy is the best of all time, or that it is the better than \"The Godfather\" (because that film stands as the number one film on the Internet Movie Database, there are heated debates from \"Rings\" fans claiming that \"The Godfather\" is trash and their favorite film is not).\n\nIt's all opinion, of course, but I sometimes wonder whether the fans of \"The Lord of the Rings,\" those who claim they are superior to \"The Godfather,\" have even seen that film. I also wonder whether the strict fans that claim it is the best film ever made have actually seen enough films to qualify for that assumption -- if it is their favorite film, fine, but to say it is THE best film of all time is entirely their opinion, although they seem to take it as a fact. Have they seen the films of Fellini? Kurosawa? Scorsese? Coppola? \"Citizen Kane\"? \"Casablanca\"? \"Taxi Driver\"? \"Sweet Smell of Success\"? \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"? \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"? \"Chinatown\"? \"Apocalypse Now\"? \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"? The list goes on!\n\nTheir definitions of classics range from the time of \"Star Wars\" to present cinema. It may sound like an old argument but it's true -- greater films are harder to find nowadays, and just because \"The Lord of the Rings\" seems like an achievement of some sort, it does not make it the best film of all time. I can name many better films. But, then again, it's my opinion, I suppose.\n\nNow that I'm done with my rant, there's nothing left to say. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) venture closer to Mordor to destroy The One Ring, while Gollum (Andy Serkis) plots to murder them both and take the Ring of Power for himself. (We get to see Gollum's background in the film, too, which is something that will satisfy Tolkien's fans that have read the stories.)\n\nMeanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) returns to the throne of a kingdom (hence the title of the film) to claim his position as heir of Isildur, but first gathers together Legolas and Gimli (Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) to help battle the Orcs venturing closer to their castle, along with Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), who opens a can of whoop [butt] in this movie.\n\nThis is the darkest film of the trilogy. You may have thought \"The Two Towers\" was dark, but \"The Return of the King\" is almost evil -- Frodo gives audiences the creeps a few times. When he says, \"The Ring is mine,\" and grins at Sam with the Elijah Wood grin, a shiver goes down your spine.\n\nThe film picks up pace starting with the giant arachnid battle, about halfway through the film, and continues down the path of mild greatness until the last twenty minutes, which never seem to end. It is as if Jackson was afraid to close his film for a final time and kept dragging the scenes out -- I don't need to see Frodo and Sam admiring each other more than twice!\n\nAs the credits rolled, the audience poured out of the theater. \"Wasn't that good?\" I heard someone say. \"No,\" was the reply. \"The Return of the King\" is a very good film, and certainly the best of the trilogy, but don't be fooled by the hype -- this is not one of the best films of all time. It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes -- some day, someone's going to realize that what they're going on about isn't really there at all. And finally all the film fans will be able to say, \"Y'know, I never really loved the movie all that much anyway.\" But for now, I guess we'll all have to put up with more unearned hype.\n\nI liked this movie. I liked it a lot at certain points. But I would never, ever call it great. That's just me, I guess.\n\n4.5/5 stars."

The biggest bone of contention I have is with the tiresomely oft-repeated nonsense that books cannot be adapted accurately to the screen. To attempt to defend Peter Jackson and these films with this claptrap is particularly misguided. Does not a picture speak a thousand words? Has not Peter Jackson used ten hours of pictures? By that measure, he could have covered Tolkien's trilogy 300 times over! To have been given ten hours and such a huge budget, was an unprecedented opportunity but what did Jackson do with it? He made his own interpretation. He got to make these three films because *Tolkien's* The Lord of the Rings demanded it. It wasn't right to use the opportunity to spend the time and money making his own hacked-up version; to *change* the story, alter characters, omit characters, change the locations of events, *make up* various events. That he did all this was sheer hubris \u2013 but since he's made profits, he's gotten away with it and only Tolkien's faithful are saddened and sickened. Bear in mind the money and success that Jackson has reaped by climbing on Tolkien's shoulders, having assured fans that he would remain faithful to the book.\n\nTo those who really think books (let alone long books) cannot be accurately adapted to the screen, I say take a long hard look at Richard Boleslawski's Les Miserables (1935). Adapted by W.P Lipscomb, Victor Hugo's huge novel (longer than The Lord of the Rings) is faithfully covered in just 108 minutes. Peter Jackson had over five times that, so there is absolutely no excuse for altering the story in any way.\n\nI'm absolutely certain that any director in the business could have achieved movies at least as good as Jackson's given the same opportunity; and any director that had the brains to stick to the proper story would have produced *better* ones. The Lord of the Rings is apparently the second most popular book after the Holy Bible, which, I would say, suggests that Tolkien writes a story a tad better than a certain Peter who?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Where do I start? Those who have already seen this movie don't need a review, and those who haven't will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. So, I'll just say how this movie personally affected me, as a fan of the books and of movies in general. I absolutely loved the original film, Fellowship of the Ring, and did enjoy the Two Towers, though not as much. I loved the emotion of the original (subtle scenes like Frodo's long decision-making boatside scene at the end), and found that the Two Towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters' feelings into the background. But this makes sense, as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. Return of the King, however, is just simply fantastic. I try to avoid statements like \"gets everything right\", and \"I enjoyed every minute of it\", but in this case, it's true. I was so moved at the presentation of this film that I couldn't help getting misty at the end, despite knowing exactly what would happen (based on the books of course). I credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music (Annie Lennox's moving \"Into the West\" is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the film's themes). And also, I couldn't help being moved knowing that it was now all over, and there will probably never be another Lord of the Rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime (and rightfully so). I just felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends. The movie, although beginning with an important flashback, begins immediately where the second film concluded, and every character has a conclusion. The main part of this movie that I loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchanged; the main characters have their own moments of screen time and good dialogue, from Gandalf telling Pippin what beautiful peace awaits him if he should die in battle, to Sam heroically carrying an exhausted Frodo on his own shoulders through sheer determination. It's all done well, and it takes its time to do it, which I wouldn't have any other way. Whereas Fellowship of the Ring dealt more in emotion and character development and the Two Towers was more hurried and action packed, I was delighted to see that return of the King found a perfect balance between the two and devotes ample time to both. The battle scenes are the grandest in scope and awe, and the highs and lows of sheer emotion are quite gracefully handled as well. And when everything is said and done and the battles are over, there's still a journey home for some of the characters and a good amount of movie left to enjoy. But everything moves along so smoothly, it's sometimes easy to forget that it's a 3 hour and fifteen minute ride. If there isn't action going on, there are scenes of pending action or drama at an almost nonstop rate, making sure that there's something to stop even the most restless from becoming bored.\n\nIf for some reason you've chosen my review out of the many available, let me at the very least leave you with this, and it will hopefully help you to decide to see it if you haven't yet: As the finale of a trilogy, this is the masterstroke that ties everything together and is successful on a multitude of levels. It's action packed and stirringly heartfelt at the same time. And finally, from someone who loves the books, I can say that although some omissions were made, the story doesn't falter as a result and the film as a whole was handled in about the most graceful, pleasing way I can imagine. It is, quite honestly, a cinematic masterpiece and a major accomplishment. I left teary eyed, happy for having been thrilled for more than 3 hours, and also quite sad that I don't have another of these films to look forward to."

Like the previous two films in the trilogy, the photography and use of scenery is amazing. The cast of characters and the battle scenes were also done extremely well and set to an equally-beautiful soundtrack. This is one of the best films in film history and almost equal to 'Star Wars'. It has a good mix of action, adventure, and character development. It's also the most emotional of the films.\n\nThe main problem that I did have with this film is the lack of an answer regarding the evil wizard. In fact, this was cut completely from the cinema release. The wizard was the face of evil in the previous two films, and he suddenly disappears, leaving an empty and unexplained face of evil. Despite that, the film is excellent in every other way."

        "review_detailed_main": "What a breathtaking end to an epic saga that will go down in cinematic history as the best trilogy that was ever created (if it hasn't already). The culmination of 10 years' work and the final chapter of Peter Jackson fantasy adventure film series, The Return of The King fires on all cylinders, as we follow our favorite middle earth characters in a larger- than-life journey that will lead to the final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Whereas in FOTR and The Two Towers when we were still learning about our characters and their surroundings, everything about the ring's importance and power is unleashed in this third installment and to great effect.\n\nWith the exception of maybe only The Godfather Trilogy, the LOTR film series is indisputably the greatest in film history (it was only the second sequel to nab a Best Picture Oscar, the only other being -you guessed it- The Godfather Part II). And what more can actually be said? The breathtaking visuals, the outstanding character development, the epic musical score, gorgeous set designs, the plethora of visually striking creatures - there's never been anything quite like this on screen before. And there never will be again! Never has a film balanced electrifying action and substantial character development so deftly while also staying true to the original source material. It will never cease to amaze me how this was all brought to life.\n\nThrough this trilogy, Jackson presents us with an unprecedented odyssey of friendship, loyalty, bravery, self-realization and so many other things. In the beginning, we are introduced to a fellowship of 9 individuals who are given the seemingly impossible task of taking the one ring to the blood-curdling world of Mordor with the goal of destroying it and saving middle earth in the process. Over the course of 3 films, our characters learn so much about themselves, about what it means to fight for what you believe in and for something bigger than then yourselves. These themes, and the scale they're presented on, completely transcend the idea of a movie and almost operate on a more biblical and spiritual fashion.\n\nAnd perhaps no film franchise has given us so many memorable characters as LOTR: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimil, Boromir, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Arwen, Eowyn and countless more. And that's JUST the good guys. We are also given such memorable villains as Gollum, Sauron and Saruman, in addition to the plethora of evil Orcs, Goblins, Demons, Dragons and other horrifying beings. If you think this sounds like a lot, nothing can prepare you for the sheer scope and vast vision of Jackson and his team. The franchise also has some of the most powerful cinematic moments I can recall from the last 40 years (Gandalf yelling \"You Shall Not Pass!\", The Battle of Helms Deep, Sam carrying Frodo up Mount Doom). Iconic doesn't do this franchise justice; it's legendary and it's immortal. It's Lord of the F****** Rings!\n\nAbove all, Jackson stays true to the major themes and philosophies from the original source material while showcasing his extraordinary cinematic talent and vision. ROTK defines what a \"fantasy\" epic should be and becomes so much more in the process; it's a resonant coming-of-age story and a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking. There just aren't enough superlatives for this film. And for this trilogy. And when you do finish it all for the first time, you'll be left sitting there with a feeling of emptiness for having left this magical world but a satisfaction in realizing you just witnessed one of the all-time greatest films and trilogies ever put to celluloid. What a crowning achievement by every single person involved."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me say first that after seeing Fellowship of the Ring, I went out and read the LOTR trilogy for the first time. I enjoyed it immensely, but I only read it once and not before I saw the first movie. So I might not be what you'd consider a true enthusiast.\n\nFrom an Enthusiasts perspective:\n\nThere were a few disappointing momemts: the fact that Gandalf *still* didn't break Sarumon's staff on screen, and the way a lot of things were glossed over a bit. Additionally, there was way too much Legolas jumping around during battles. I understand they cost $9 million to make and not showing them would be effectively \"wasting\" $9 million, but there are more important things to show.\n\nFinally, and this was known very early on so it wasn't a surprise, the conclusion of the trilogy was completely removed. This trilogy began and ended with the Hobbits. It began by exposing them as lovable but helpless characters, and ended showing them to be courageous and capable of addressing significant problems. The movies, however, focused a little more on the characters people love, and while I don't fault them for that, I do fault them for not trying to show the ending of the trilogy in any way whatsoever. As an enthusiast, I can't grade the movie on its own; I must rate it as a trilogy. And this trilogy would get 9.5 / 10.\n\nFrom Joe's perspective:\n\nJoe wouldn't be nearly as acquanted with the characters, and a lot of what this movie succeeds on for the enthusiasts plays off of that. This is still a good movie, if a bit broken up giving far too many \"it's wrapping up\" signals. Frodo spends far too much time crying (honestly, this dragged on), and the characters spend far too much time saying \"farewell.\" Joe liked the movie, but gave it a 7.0 / 10 because there are movies he simply enjoys more."

The Dead King and co. are a well realised, visually cool bunch of deus ex machina and Gandalf steeling Merry for death is a beautiful moment. The final battle flows extremely well, it's nothing tonally alike to the filthy last stand at Helms Deep, this is trained army vs trained army. The focus of Aragorn's conclusion to be crowned rightfully King is satisfying and the right icing on the cake.\n\nRegarding the extended edition, it's made weakest of the three only insofar as the theatrical of Return of the King is the most complete and impressive of the three. However, the opening scenes of Sauron are the most required and missed from the theatrical and I'm in favour of the many endings of this film because after 11 hours of movie, it earns the right to take an hour to draw to a close."

        "review_detailed_main": "As you can no doubt surmise, I was not very taken with the (hopefully) last of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy. Although I was extremely impressed with the special effects, the story itself was as tedious as reading the book. I wasn't terribly impressed with the idea of the diminutive Hobbit heroes, Frodo (Elijah Wood), a sweet, gentle dwarf and his flabby sidekick Sam (Sean Astin), from some yah-yah land called Hobbiton, traipsing across the geography while risking life and limb so that he could ultimately drop an evil ring into an erupting volcano while wholesale death and destruction rage on nearby. It seems that the film was primarily interested in exposing the violence-hungry audiences of the world with as much death, suffering, ugliness, and gore as they could cram into their painfully long (3 \u00bd hours) cinematic colossus.\n\nIt is easy to cheer the slaughter of the adversaries since most of them were masterpieces of ugliness, decay, and disease. Some of the evil crowd depicted an orthodontist's fantasy come true with teeming examples of really bad dental decay and deformity exploited at every opportunity. To compound the repulsiveness, director Peter Jackson must have scoured the dermatology handbook for examples to create puffed out, discolored, and distorted skin tissue; lesions, cancerous oozings, and other disgusting aberrations. Of course, there were also the obligatory humpbacks or other physical anomalies to add to your visual distress so that when the heroic saviors sliced and diced them by hundreds you would not feel so bad.\n\nOne cannot help but admire Gandolf (Ian McKellen), the wise wizard with his flowing white beard. He is not only all knowing, omnipotent, and full of convenient magic when it suits him, but for a guy in his sixties he rides like a cowboy stuntman and brandishes his sword in battle like a twenty-something. Since this is all a fantasy, why not do something far-fetched now and then?\n\nThe good guys in this piece of prolonged carnage are extra nice and the female love objects like Arwen (Liv Taylor), are truly heavenly to look at. Frodo and Sam look like they would be terrified to walk around in downtown Carmel, let alone to take on the hideous lineup that seem to lurk behind every bush. Why they put up with the whims of the numskulls who insist on slaughtering the entire leper colony entourage is beyond my comprehension.\n\nIf you see this movie just to enjoy the special effects, it is well worth the price of admission. However, if you want to see a good film, well that is another matter entirely. If you enjoy lots of blood and destruction, this piece is for you. There is enough carnage in this flick to make war films like `Saving Private Ryan' or `War and Piece' seem like a walk in the park. It is one helluva commentary on the American public who seem to enjoy a lot more violence than they are willing to admit. It is hardly a wonder that Americans so easily rallied to Bush's deceptive war cries when the Nation ostensibly professes to be such a peace-loving people."

The visual effects were spectacular and they have increased the scope of any film. This film took the film-making to new heights which were previously not thought of. Peter Jackson for this very reason became one of the greatest filmmakers ever.\n\nThe beginning is very simple, and it takes us to the backstory of the ring. The battle scenes are nothing short of epic. The culmination is happy and this has a feel good ending. everything is so perfectly commercial on the face of it. But, to tell it the way it has been told is stupendous.\n\nThe acts by all, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sean Austin as Sam, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn are the most memorable for me. These are characters I shall not forget ever in my lifetime.\n\nThe writing by JRR Tolkein is a masterpiece in itself but to translate such visual strength to the celluloid would have been the greatest challenge for any filmmaker. Just happy that Peter Jackson did his bit in bringing one of the greatest fantasy novels to the public reach, He actually did a great service by doing so. He served the book readers and the film viewers hugely.\n\nThanks to all, who have made this film and the trilogy a possibility and I am going with 5/5. Nothing less for one of the greatest films."

        "review_detailed_main": "And so, Jackson fulfills his vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's story of Middle-earth and he does so with breathtaking detail and near-flawless artistic craftsmanship. Both previous entries of Jackson's epic \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy were spectacular achievements. \"Return of the King\" is an eleven Academy Award-winning movie and I suppose it's very worthy of such a title. It pretty much has won all of its Oscars for the entire trilogy, finally scoring big in the Best Picture category. Box office was also incredible, this film is the second biggest hit worldwide, just barely behind James Cameron's superb film \"Titanic\".\n\n\"Return of the King\" is the conclusion of the trilogy. The stories of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Aragorn, and the others comes to a close as the characters all meet their fates. The final battle against the dreaded Sauron begins and there are numerous, almost countless battle sequences throughout the film using combinations of live-action actors in costumes and makeup, and state-of-the-art flawless visual effects created through months of hard work. The giant deranged elephants, trolls, and the sadistic Gollum are all incredibly convincing despite the fact that they are simply an illusion put on the film screen. Sometimes you might be able to guess that they are CGI, but Jackson's skills at directing a medieval battle sequence draws you into the action too much to pay any attention to the detail of the graphics. And you have to look hard to find any possible flaws or weak points.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is an amazing film trilogy, definitely one the best, ranking amongst others such as \"Star Wars\". \"Return of the King\" is an amazing achievement as well. Perhaps its only flaw is the excessive running time at nearly four hours in length. Still, that does not make it a disappointment in any way. That is unless you want it to be extremely faithful to Tolkien's original work. For me, it's a great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "As the saying goes, \"All good things must come to an end\", but seldom does one wish to refute such a statement as strongly as in the case of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien had become a holiday tradition, leaving the prospect of a December without Middle Earth an almost overwhelmingly bleak future. After struggling through over six hours of emotional investment, viewer expectations were at a critical peak: how could such a painstakingly, lovingly constructed journey possibly be brought to a satisfying conclusion? Suffice to say, the film does not disappoint, its ensuing 11 Academy Awards still seeming to fall short of properly appreciating the triumphant masterpiece of a conclusion. The title proves prophetic, as the film marked the true ascent of Jackson's films into the realm of abiding classics.\n\nDebate over which film can be regarded as the strongest of the three continues eternal and remains largely a matter of individual taste, but a strong case can be made for Return of the King being at least the most rounded of the trilogy. With epic, rousing battle scenes to match any set pieces of The Two Towers and heartfelt emotional moments to rival any in Fellowship of the Ring, Return of the King exemplifies the trilogy's strengths while providing the necessary catharsis for the entire painstaking journey. And an emotional climax it is, as Jackson delves into the darkest and most tumultuous expedition into Middle- Earth. From the first notes of Howard Shore's flat out stunning musical score, the viewer is ensnared, as Jackson generates gruellingly heartfelt emotional resonance with awe-inspiring ease.\n\nOnly in the hands of such a confident filmmaker could such unbridled sentiment steer clear of the embarrassingly melodramatic, but in such an engrossingly crafted world, even the most stilted lines ring as rousing, genuine and emotionally resonant - it would be a feat indeed for any viewer, no matter how jaded, to hold back tears at the film's wrenching finale. Despite the occasional trimmed scene (fans of the novel may lament Saruman's death scene, seen on the DVD extended edition), Jackson as always remains obsessively faithful to Tolkien's vision, and while the enormous running time and conclusion after conclusion may prove trying to those unfamiliar with Tolkien's works, it is impossible to imagine a more satisfying adaptation of the timeless novel.\n\nBut even viewers spoiled on Jackson's first two takes on Tolkien's fantasy world will find themselves spellbound by the visual mastery on display. Easily a pinnacle of cinematic aesthetics, Jackson's Middle-Earth remains an indescribably lush, expansive tapestry of imaginative beauty. Seldom has a world been so credibly and completely generated, with staggering attention to detail ranging from the vast action set pieces (Jackson gleefully indulges his schlocky horror roots with Frodo and Sam's eerie, unbearably tense battle with monstrous spider Shelob, and lets rip with the enthralling siege of Gondor. And if his cross- cutting between Gondor's face-off with the combined armies of Mordor and the overwhelmingly heightened volcanic climax at Mount Doom can become infuriating - I'm prone to yelling \"GO AWAY, TROLL\" at this point - it's testament to how painfully invested the viewer is) to the smallest etching on a soldier's helmet. It is such minuscule details which reveal that Jackson's dedication is not just to showy exteriors but in truly bringing to life the spirit of the source novels, and as such, The Return of the King proves peerless.\n\nCapturing an audience's interest and sympathies for three vast films in a row would be no easy feat, had the exemplary cast not created some of the most beloved film characters of all time. While keeping tortured protagonist Frodo an engaging and tragic lead instead of simply bug-eyed and annoying is a thankless task, Elijah Wood remains quietly charming enough to master the audience's sympathies throughout. Ian McKellen redefines the word class as noble wizard Gandalf, while mercifully still allowing moments of warm humour to slip through the cracks of his dignified solemnity. Viggo Mortensen's quiet yet ferocious charisma makes his heroic Aragorn a truly powerful and resonant figure, and Sean Astin infuses the wrenching journey of Frodo's noble companion Sam with pulsing emotion and endearing heart, a truly remarkable performance.\n\nThe forever underrated Andy Serkis generates an enormously powerful performance, riddled with menace, humour, pathos, and exceptional physicality as the viciously obsessive Gollum. Bernard Hill emanates subtle nobility as patriarch Th\u00e9oden, while David Wenham is truly compelling as discounted Gondorian noble Faramir. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan expand beyond comic relief to true dramatic sentiment as hobbits Pippin and Merry, and Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies continue their comic banter and exhilarating fight scenes as elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli to welcome effect. Similarly, the often overshadowed female cast members more than hold their own despite lack of screen time, as Miranda Otto is rousing and gripping as tenacious noblewoman Eowan, and Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler prove distinguished and mesmerizing as Elven royals Galadriel and Arwen.\n\nSuch praise could prolong to the extent of the film's succession of endings. Suffice to say, The Return of the King embodies the strengths of a trilogy that, uncontroversially, can be considered some of the greatest filmmaking of all time. A truly stunning melding of exhilarating action, devastating emotional storytelling and sumptuous visuals, The Return of the King proves an engrossing epic of cinematic magic in its most most fulfilling, unpretentious form. Even for those normally dismissive of the fantasy genre, the last of Jackson's cinematic masterpieces is almost sure to enthral and capture the heart as next to no other film can.\n\n-10/10"

It's spectacular, but lacks charm. It's a must see if you are into popcorn cinema, but it shares the same aesthetic of the previous two movies, and it gets tiresome. As an adaptation, it's not perfect, but it's as good as it gets if you take into account how difficult is to make such a big movie.\n\nThis the latest modern mammoth movie, so take it for what it is. It hasn't been the first, and it won't be the last. Sometimes your jaw will drop, but everybody knows that there is not much merit in making the film looks the way it does. The merit lies in having finished the movie at all.\n\nIt's almost impossible to write a more complex review and not sound like an pretentious asshole. I had a lot of fun, but something was lacking. Apply this review to parts I & II.\n\nRATING: 7.1"

        "review_detailed_main": "I still don't like these films, but this was the least intolerable of the three. I think it had the greatest departures from the books in plot, but was perhaps the closest to the books in meaning. I'm not even talking about all the characters and events left out; there's lots of stuff here that never happened in the book.\n\nThe acting is sometimes painful. Frodo and Sam are particularly given to intervals of mawkishness. Gimli is shamefully used for comic relief. The dialogue's just horrible; exposition is awkward (\"A diversion!\") - I suspect the actors are giving the director what he's asked for, it's the director and writers I question. Anyway, the adults come out okay except Eomer, reduced to mere grimacing in the background. It's the little people who suffer.\n\nVisuals are often not to my taste, but are impressive. Frodo always glows. Everything hobbity is very golden-lit and twinkly and twee - I think that's the worst setting mistake. Hobbits should be those we identify with most closely, not those we're distanced from. Minas Tirith is barely glimpsed before it's overrun by the Goths and Visigoths; Edoras outshines it.\n\nI don't like the battle scenes. Cuts to show the sea of Orcs menacing a small city of troop of Men are unimpressive after so many repetitions, and the fighting scenes are very rapidly cut and look kinda undercranked and unfocussed, especially when using lots of CG troops. Necessary perhaps, but it still looks bad.\n\nWhat was right? They made a great scene of the lighting of the signal fires, and the relay from hill to hill, though it went on too long. The songs were good. The human kings rallying their troops to hopeless battles were actually magnificent. Gandalf was less the remote magician and more the humanized power than in the first two movies. The tone is more epic than in the first two installments - they seemed to use scale of battles and scale of scenery as a substitute for theme and pace. ROTK didn't make me look at my watch nearly as much as FOTR and TTT. And there's more Viggo, whom I love, but he may not be quite as good. *sigh*\n\nAnyway, it's still pretty crummy. Gak! Also, I think this one would be _very_ hard to understand without having read the books or seen the first two - I wished I'd refreshed my memory of the previous movie before watching this."

        "review_detailed_main": "As I said in the reviews for the previous two chapters, I was curious for years about the LOTR trilogy because of ther reputation and many reviews. The first was great and a nice introduction, the second, while not outstanding, still good in some ways and the third... too great that it's a shame that you can't rate a movie with a score higher than 10, it's too damn perfect!\n\nAfter a prologue that shows us the origins of Gollum we join Gandalf, Eomer, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas (Ian McKellen, Karl Urban, Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom) that on the way to Isengard meet Merry and Tuc (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) that tell them about Treebeard that won against Saruman who is now imprisoned in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf then goes to Denethor for preparing him for Sauron's attack but Denethor is insane because his son Boromir (Sean Bean) died: in the meanwhile Frodo, Samwise (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) and Gollum arrive to Minas Morgul where Gollum makes Frodo believe that Sam wants the precious ring, but Sam will save Frodo from a giant spider. After a long battle Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and the army of the dead ogres arrive to Gondor, and now they don't have any other choice than go to Mordor, so that Frodo can go to Mount Doom for destroying the ring. Frodo is attacked by the ogres only to be saved by Sam, and can finally throw the ring in the lava despite a fight with Gollum. After the ring melts, the army or Mordor goes away and Sauron's spirit is defeated forever. Frodo and Sam are saved by the eagles and are taken to Gondor, and the day after in Minas Tirith there is the crowning of Aragorn as the new king and the celebration of his wedding with Arwen (Liv Tyler). In the end we see Bilbo finishing his book and Frodo decides to travel with the last elves left to Valinor.\n\nThe sets are huge and spectacular at the same time, and the money was spent well for the scope. The performances by all (Mortensen, Bloom, Astin, Cate Blanchett, Wood, McKellen, Tyler and Rhys Davies) were all the great, and the soundtrack was on par with all the other settings. I especially loved the song OVER THE HORIZON by Annie Lennox towards the end credits, it was that great. The battle scenes and special effects were marvellous considering it was made in 2003.\n\nOverall, a must for fans of the trilogy and besides that, a masterpiece that has to be seen at least once for its greatness, it's that powerful!"

        "review_detailed_main": "First, no storyline description is needed for this movie, seeing as how the majority of the known universe has seen it. Second, I have read the books, thoroughly and repeatedly, so I may offer my humble opinions on the film's comparable continuity.\n\nIn short, this movie cannot be topped. By anything. Ever. Period.\n\nBut since this section is meant for me to voice my opinions, I will justify my judgment. Peter Jackson had his work cut out for him when he took up this task with New Line as his backer, mainly because it is a presold product. The LOTR books have a following second to none, and failure on Jackson's part would likely have led to his assassination by an overzealous Tolkienite. However, he has performed admirably, and has managed to stay as close to the literate plot as possible. There are several jagged details which cause me to cringe every time I encounter them on the silver screen, but as a whole, I remain nonetheless satisfied. The most obvious of these is the romantic subplot. While I am by no means sexist, I believe that this subplot was added simply to keep female viewers who had not read the books interested. Arwen and Eowyn's romantic involvement with Aragorn in the books is no more than a passing mention, if that. There are no long dialogues between Aragorn and Arwen, and there are no dreamlike telepathic connections. In this matter, Peter Jackson certainly took some creative liberties, but I suppose it did help romanticize the plot slightly. But only slightly. I have several other small complaints about altered plots and over-dramatization, but I will continue to annoy my friends and relatives with these, instead of subjecting the worldwide audience to my extremist scrutiny.\n\nThe CGI effects of this movie are mindblowing. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields will stand out in cinematic history as the crowning jewel of combat sequences. It will be many years, and many failed attempts before this battle will be paralleled, nonetheless succeeded of it's title. Also, no doubt through the aid and constant vigil of the Official LOTR Fanclub (who always had Jackson's ear) I often found myself thinking \"that was exactly how I imagined it\", and was very pleased and even surprised by how accurate he had done his craft. As for Gollum, what can I say, but that he was a continuation of perfection from The Two Towers. I especially enjoyed how it further explained Smeagol's past, and his finding of The One Ring.\n\nNow some quick ratings. Some of these may spoil their appearance in the movie for some, so be warned.\n\nGollum: A\n\nSiege of Minas Tirith: A+\n\nThe Oathbreakers (Ghost Army): A+\n\nDeath of the Witch King: A-\n\nArwen: C\n\nFrodo and Sam's \"relationship\": B\n\nFilm length: A (will be explained)\n\nThat is one matter I feel I should address. These books were written in a time when it was completely acceptable for one man to say to another that he loved him, strictly in a platonic way. Leave your homophobic inhibitions outside the theatre, and please do not say lewd comments during what should be rather emotional scenes.\n\nThe other major source of much moaning and groaning in the theatre is the length of the film. Yes, it is three and a half hours. Yes, that is a long movie. Yes, you knew how long it was when you bought the ticket. No, other people do not want to hear you moan about how long it is. And finally, yes, Peter Jackson stayed as close to the books as possible. The storyline does drag on near the end of the books, so by making the movie similar to the books, Peter Jackson was simply doing his directorial duty. These books mean a lot to a lot of people, and if he had sold them short on what (for many people) are the most influential novels of their lives, he would not be a very good film maker would he. Peter Jackson had an enormous task ahead of him, and he most likely had two main challenges on his mind during production. First, to satisfy the already obsessed LOTR fanbase; second, to captivate the part of the audience who do not live and breathe LOTR. There is a fantastic volume of story to be told on those pages, and much of it has been left out from the movies, leaving only the core events and their inspired emotions. Had Jackson not trimmed them down to where they are now, each movie would easily surpass twelve hours. Easily. It is a minor miracle that Jackson was able to convert such a literary masterpiece from pages to picture, and the audience should be pleased by its creation, not moan every fifteen seconds waiting for it to end.\n\nAll in all, Return of the King was a flawless finale to a fantastic trilogy. Few trilogies can boast the numbers that LOTR can, and still remain captivating when it comes to it's end. Return of the King is a shoe-in for Best Picture at the Oscars, and will likely sweep the globe in a flurry of well-known and not-so well-known awards. Despite my gripes over minor details and plot alterations (Where's good ol' Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Downs?), I know cinematic perfection when I see it. That is why I gave this film a ten."

        "review_detailed_main": "Antipodean director Peter Jackson here proves beyond doubt that he's picked up Spielberg's mantle as the director most competent at blending dazzling special effects with convincing emotional drama. The third part of Jackson's opus sees the One Ring return to Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit, while the hordes of Gorgoroth sweep into the realm of man in their tens of thousands. Bad Taste this ain't.\n\nThis is the boldest of the three movies in that it necessarily must take the most risks in depicting Tolkien's universe. It's a delicate balancing act. For instance, some will love the Jackson of old re-emerging for the Paths of the Dead sequence, while others will resent its Temple of Doom comedy-horror stylings. Legolas skipping up the leg of an olyphaunt and then sliding down its trunk as it falls: fanboys loathe that stuff; the kids love it. But thankfully, due to Return of the King's structure - a series of action scenes built around Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) dreadful narration - one doesn't have to wait long until the next set-piece arrives. And we're spoiled for choice. Gandalf, for example, doesn't only narrate - he also, exhilaratingly, sweeps onto the plain of Pelennor to ward off the Nazgul with a blinding shaft of light. Shelob doesn't disappoint; Weta have created a memorable monster who tickles the neck-hairs of Tolkien devotees and unsuspecting arachnophobics alike (I had not yet read the novel at this point...). And the lighting of the beacons, erupting from far snow-capped peaks, calling to Gondor under the bellowing strains of Howard Shore's aptly triumphant score, might be the single most rousing sequence in movie history. It's the ignition of hope, a glimmer of unbridled joy before the darkness descends.\n\nThe biggest omission from the novel is the Scouring of the Shire. I happen to agree with the screenwriters' decision. By that time, we've already had two or three endings. We've been stuffed with a veritable feast in the form of the Battle of Pelennor and the Fall of Sauron; the Scouring, I believe, would have been an unwanted dessert. Besides, Tolkien's epilogue was something of a matter of celebrity. Aragorn's final words to the hobbits, as all of Middle Earth kneels, says more about the height of their standing than any Shire-war would.\n\nSome minor flaws still remain. Legolas and Gimli's character arcs still reach no real resolution (but then, do we really need another two endings?). The position of the Battle of Pelennor in the story's narrative doesn't really lend itself to the classical Hollywood narrative very comfortably - there's a predictable, albeit only slight, feeling of 'winding down' in all that follows. Also, on this extended DVD, the point at which we are asked to change discs comes at a most inopportune time, as the drums of war are at their peak.\n\nBut it seems strangely impertinent to sniff out the trilogy's few flaws; to do so is like picking at the hem of the Bayeux Tapestry. Will we ever see such a wholly satisfying series of films again? Not in my lifetime. (N.B. The score is for all three.) This is pure cinema. Jackson and his creative family just don't stop giving. He has successfully translated his love for his source material and created a body of work that will live on and become equally loved. The scope of his achievement is undeniable; as entertainment, this is about as close to perfection as cinema will get."

The following comments refer only to the movie, as a piece of cinema.\n\nThere is way too much presumption. The story starts off about a ring that is oh very powerful, controls everybody, is evil blah blah. All that is fine. OK, the ring is so very evil and powerful. But would'nt any rational person ask what makes the ring so powerful? The reasons are never provided. What makes it so valuable and important that people are going to wars over it, people are mutating over it and why does the villain want it? What is its secret? It would'nt be unfair to assume that the Return of the King answers all these questions. It absolutely does not.\n\nThere is simply no story in this movie. It fails to explain what happened or even whats going on. As with the ring, why should one also has to presume that Sauron is so evil that hes worth fighting with all the armies of middle earth? With so much story surrounding Sauron, his appearance is restricted to nothing more than a large fiery eye. Just why is he so evil. Just why is he so feared? What did he do that was so bad? None of that is ever answered in any of the LOTR movies.\n\nDevoid of a story, the whole series are nothing more than a tour through middle earth when your, or anyone else's specific presence do not really matter. It looks more like a big documentary rather than a movie. The first two parts may have been slightly entertaining but streaching the same formula for yet another movie delivers an abysmally boring experience. The inhabitants of middle earth may have also been something original when Tolkien wrote them, but it is not so today."

His Elvish-language song at the coronation was a nice touch.\n\nSecond to the battles, the lighting of the bonfires along the mountain tops was both gorgeous and exciting.\n\nI am relieved that Eowyn and Faramir's romance shows will show up in the DVD because the sudden appearance of Arwen with an approving father in Minas Tirith is simply a befuddled resolution to the triangular tensions. I am sympathetic, however, about having to leave some things out in a rushed conclusion due to the length as I did have trouble sitting through to the credits, what with the extensive previews tacked on as well.\n\nBut the Gollum/Smeagol vs. Frodo and Sam competition was instead the more gripping, perhaps because the power of evil is so intensely represented by the close-up interior and exterior struggles of these almost-four characters trekking to Mordor.\n\nI didn't mind the multiple endings that others have complained of as I respected the loyalty to the source material.\n\nHoward Shore's music was martial without being bombastic, and Annie Lennox's vocalization fit in surprisingly in the over-the-credits song.\n\n(originally written 12/28/2003)"

        "review_detailed_main": "It took J.R.R. Tolkien twelve years to complete this epic trilogy. It took Peter Jackson almost ten years to complete the movie adaptation of that trilogy (he'd been working on it since 1997). It's been a long journey, but it was worth it. Every single step.\n\nSo, this is the one where it all comes to an end: Frodo(Elijah Wood) must conquer his fears in order to fulfill his mission, the destruction of the One Ring; Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), on the other hand, is supposed to accept and embrace his fate, which is to reclaim the throne of Gondor, while all the armies available are fighting against the Dark Lord Sauron's forces. The freedom of Middle Earth is at stake...\n\nLike in The Two Towers, character development is pretty much ignored in favor of the visually stunning combats (the 50-minute long battle of Pelennor Fields is breathtaking). Actually, that's the only defect of the theatrical version (rating:9/10) of The Return of the King: at 3 hours and 12 minutes it's, ironically, too short, mostly because of the biggest plot hole ever (what happened to Saruman), a scene which is gloriously restored in the extended edition, which is a must-see if you want the complete story.\n\nNow, let's talk about the best thing in the movie: Sean Astin. He already proved he was a great actor in the previous films, but in this one he really shines, giving us a tormented, angry, but loyal character, willing to do anything for his master (fans will never forget this line: \"I can't carry it (the Ring) for you! But I can carry YOU!\", probably the single most moving piece of dialogue in the entire trilogy). Shame the Academy overlooked his astounding performance.\n\nWell, at least they didn't overlook the entire movie, each one of its 11 Oscars being fully deserved. The Return of the King isn't just the best picture of 2003, it's among the absolutely best movies of all time.\n\nPeter Jackson has written a new, exciting page of cinema history, and we will always be grateful for that."

        "review_detailed_main": "...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the \"goriest movie ever made\" (1992's \"Dead Alive\"), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of \"The Lord of the Rings\" saga, which include \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001), \"The Two Towers\" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner \"The Return of the King\" (2003).\n\n***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.\n\nNot since \"Star Wars\" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing \"The Lord of the Rings\" films. \"The Lord of the Rings\" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the \"PG-13\" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get \"into\" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and \"The Enemy,\" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (\"live\" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a \"fellowship of the ring.\" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called \"The Lord of the Rings\" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.\n\n10/10"

Peter Jackson left the best for last in this epic of all epics. The scale of the film is huge and the battles and set pieces are massive. This film is a masterpiece that needs to be experienced. The ending is touching and brought chills.\n\nThe acting is once again amazing.

I have to stress once again that they are also perfectly cast in this film.\n\nThe pacing and runtime is perfect.\n\nThe battles in this film are grand, spectacular, and massive.\n\nPros: Amazing story throughout all three films, a wonderful and touching ending, amazing acting, perfect casting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and the battles are amazing\n\nCons: None at all\n\nOverall Rating: 10"

He has taken an unmanageable array of literary devices and narratives to present us with incredible visual passages, emotional journeys, and seamless blends of new technology and old-fashioned storytelling.\n\nJust like its two previous chapters, RTOK is of epic proportions. With the assistance of adept editors, the different story lines are integrated and keep us engaged for nearly 4 hours. We get to the rewarding payoff where all will be resolved.\n\nROTK is a nearly perfect film, and some people might argue that its various endings might lessen the impact of its conclusion. It's hard to walk away from such magnificent storytelling with a simple ending. It's at least interesting to at least explore the many possibilities that such a tale might lead us to."

        "review_title": "Good but massively over-rated!",
        "review_detailed_main": "A lot of people looking on this page will thoroughly disagree and disregard my comments but I feel justified in saying that the Lord of the Rings trilogy and this final part in particular are possibly some of the most over-rated films of all time! I hasten to add that I do like the films and rate them as very good 7 or 8 out of 10 but I just do not see them as the 10/10 all time greats that other people see them as. I love fantasy stories and films in general, I just find these films to be far less impressive than most people appear to think they are. The main thing in the trilogy I find absolutely impressive is Gollum (Andy Serkis). The motion capture performance by Serkis is genius and the CGI character was the best up to that time. Also Gollum is a great character, hilarious, sometimes creepy and fascinating. Also you cannot fault Christopher Lee as Saruman, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and there are other good performances too.\n\nMost people who loved the books or loves this kind of story understandably lap the films up enthusiastically. An epic, massive budget presentation of one of the most famous and loved fantasy stories is somewhat irresistible to anyone who likes fantasy stories at all. However, I was a little bit underwhelmed on my first viewing of the films and have remained so with each viewing. They are not bad films at all. They have great spectacle, have some epic action, some scenes with effective humour or emotion and some fine actors but there is a lot I find disappointing. LOTR would be extremely difficult to adapt to film for anybody and I don't think these films do it as well as they could. There is a lot of time wasted unnecessarily and important aspects of story and character are left out or underdeveloped.\n\nI find Peter Jackson generally a far from 100% successful director. His version of King Kong is poor and shows his faults even a lot more than the LOTR trilogy. All these Jackson made films are a bit overblown and a little pretentiously directed. Extremely long shots of characters gazing into camera, at each other or into the distance occur so often it is incredible. A great director does not need words to tell a story or convey emotion and the face and eyes of an actor can be used to huge effect. But most shots of characters without dialogue in this trilogy fail to make me feel anything other than they are wasting time! Frodo (Elijah Wood) especially just gazes or gawps for what seems like ages without making me connect with his feelings and without moving the character or story on at all.\n\nCGI is the real king in these films and as impressive as many scenes are, it never thrills as much as the real scenery or real action in some older epics. The epic spectacle is therefore not enough to carry me away on its own, it requires great storytelling. Some great storytelling does occur in these films but I do not feel Tolkein's story or characters are done full justice due to Jackson wasting time on 'pretty', glossy, showy film making. A real efficiency and supreme skill was needed to get the most from the source material and this is lacking. For instance, Return of the King misses out important aspects of Aragorn, Feramir and Saruman's stories and I find Frodo comes across as rather petulant, annoying and lacking heroism. Samwise comes across a lot better.\n\nA great villain completes a great story. Sauron appears a feeble 'villain' throughout the trilogy. A flaming eye is not exactly Darth Vader! Tolkein created a villain difficult to show effectively on screen and Jackson's presentation of Sauron fails to convey threat or menace at all. Saruman is a good villain and is brilliantly acted by Christopher Lee but has totally insufficient screen time, particularly in the final story where he goes straight to DVD!\n\nOverall The Return of the King is easily the weakest of the trilogy for my tastes featuring faults I have listed above, rather overblown CGI action and an extraordinarily dragged out ending.\n\nYes these films are very good but for me they are nowhere near the classics they are reputed to be or that they could have been if perfectly directed."

It also misses one important chapter when Saruman destroys the Shire... Some characters have no meaning in the movie (Faramir, Witch King)... Witch King has very big orientation problems trying to hit Eowyn with that big weapon rather than use some witchcraft to kill her... Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) doesn't have the voice of a King when he tries to encourage the army to fight (see Braveheart (Mel Gibson) or Gladiator (Russel Crowe))...\n\nIt would have probably been a great movie without the first 2 parts, but this one brings nothing new or extraordinary except the Undead army which kills all orcs BAAH !\n\nIf you are interested in special effects then go watch the movie, if you are interested in how the story ends better read the book.\n\n6 points out of 10."

I am sure Jackson lost a TON of money by boycotting these things that everyone hates - it is just another example of how he made these excellent movies not for himself or a production company, but for the people that love watching them ... it is very unlikely, but it sure would be nice if others would take a few lessons on philosophy from Pete Jackson - bravo for looking after the people that pay the bills instead of the ones that make all the money from them"

The second film was also excellent, although it began to try too hard to be important and profound. This last installment was intensely boring at times as it strived to be profound. This could have been a great movie, as it so often depicted scenes according to my imagination. Unfortunately, while describing the world it lost the essence of the story. The movie seemed to lose its way not only with pace, but with its heart. This marvelous story of extraordinary effort by the gifted and those less so to face head on an evil of incredible proportions went astray at too many crucial points. Granted it hit the mark in places, but it in others it almost seemed to take the credit from the valiant and place it solely on supernatural and circumstance."

The whole audience was in a 3 hour chokehold during the return of the king.\n\nOver the 3 films, everything is perfect, the music, scenery, costume, dialogue of Tolkien's genius work, the character development and the films ability to have the values of love, friendship, resilience, hope and good over evil embedded throughout this film is why i rate it a 10.\n\nEverybody should watch this trilogy or at least try it if it's out of their comfort zone. It will change your life for the better."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Return of the King is the renowned final chapter in Peter Jackson's legendary Lord of The Rings film trilogy. The films in this trilogy are widely considered to be some of the greatest fantasy films ever made.\n\nIt is a testament to the quality of Return of the King that it is without a doubt the best film in the trilogy. The story, characters, world building, and cinematography all combine to create one of the most magnificent franchise finales of all time.\n\nThe Return of the King boasts an emotionally powerful and moving story of how sheer perseverance, love, loyalty, and friendship are more important qualities than mere physical strength. It also brilliantly showcases how even the smallest person can accomplish great feats of heroism and courage. These were always the core themes of Lord of the Rings and this film makes sure they take center stage in the narrative.\n\nThe story is also brilliantly grounded in human emotion which makes for a very emotionally stirring watch. Many of the most powerful scenes in the film are after the great battles have died down and the characters share intimate, bittersweet, and touching moments with each other. Some of these moments are enough to bring tears from nearly anyone's eyes.\n\nThis timeless story is elevated by what can only be described as a near flawless cast. The amount of acting talent on display here is astounding with greats like Sir lan Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Karl Urban, and Orlando Bloom all giving memorable acting performances in an enormous ensemble cast. The performances of this top notch cast perfectly bring the characters to life and help to immerse the audience into the film's captivating world.\n\nThe Return of the King's spectacular visuals are some of the finest in the history of blockbuster filmmaking. The larger than life cinematography vividly conveys the unimaginable vastness of Middle Earth. Grand sweeping shots of mountain ranges, nearly endless fields, volcanoes, gigantic ancient cities, and other arresting vistas are shown with stunning detail. The way Jackson effortlessly blends CGI locales with real places in these shots is astonishing and something I have not seen done nearly as well in any other movie outside of the other Lord of the Rings films.\n\nOn the subject of CGI, the special effects work for this film is truly state of the art. The impossibly realistic motion capture on Gollum's face, along with the marvellously sinister monster and creature designs are both impressive to behold.\n\nThis great special effects work and the audacious cinematography both work in perfect union during any of The Return of the King's jaw dropping battle sequences. The battles in this film simply must be seen to be believed. I do not speak lightly when I say that Return of The King has some of the most epic, breathtaking, and blood pumping battle scenes in movie history. Peter Jackson's excellent direction and the overwhelming visual spectacle of these scenes are enough to make them endlessly exciting on every re-watch.\n\nThese unbelievable action sequences are enhanced further by a chilling and awe inspiring musical score by composer Howard Shore. This phenomenal soundtrack also permeates the film's more quiet character moments too where it is serene and beautiful to listen to. It works wonders to elevate these scenes as well\n\nOverall, The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King is one of the purest examples of an emotional rollercoaster you will find in American Cinema. It can make you cry, cheer, and smile like almost no other film. It is a timeless grand epic and a true landmark in the fantasy film genre."

Despite the amazing amount of hype and numerous people saying these film were the best ever, I tried when I watched this and 1st film to watch them with an open mind neither being swayed to thinking there great because everyone else said this or the opposite. But come on, people. I have to say they appear just whizzy special effects lead extreme good versus dark (as in surroundings) ugly evil people (basically Star Wars). The storyline is tame and straighforward and the characters uninteresting. Star Wars is better and there massively overrated as well (if they removed those annoying 2 robots all together). Its basically a good film for kids with all this simplicity and straight good v evil, and I fail to see why so many adults like it so much. None of the three films deserve to be in the top100 if your like and competition of thoughtful, intelligent, well acted, important, sharply written films there. Maybe everyone just likes a straight forward situation of immense good vs terrible evil, so they know who there supporting, rather than the immensely complicated debatable thought provoking events of real life.\n\nI guess thats why the genre is called fantasy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Commenting the first part of this novel I said that it was a real message for peace, but I cannot assert the same for this final one . Although technically this film is one of the best in its special effects, it has too many battles which make it sometimes boring, battle after battle with no space to think or to relax. It also amazed me to see that the villain of this story, i.e. Christopher Lee disappeared with no explanation. I was unsuccessfully looking for him in the film, but later learned that even the same Lee is now arguing for the exclusion of his scenes from this film. Why such a exclusion? It is a real mystery. One can guest more or less the rest of the plot, the good boys winning over the evil. In fact the end of the film is like a poem, Frodo has to go to a kind of a sweet death leaving Sam sad. This scene is certainly unexpected and makes you think that death is fatal but can be welcome when good doing has taken place. In any case, my criticism here does not demerit the success of the whole serial of these three films, but the third one should have been the best and it was not."

What geniuses are Tolkien and Peter Jackson!' They see a helicopter-view of a battlefield, great graphics of a fictional city, a realistic monster-spider, and they're happy.

Unfortunately it is very slow at some parts of the movie and having read the books myself i can tell you there are huge plot holes in the story and much of it was actually changed to fit into the movie.\n\nThis movie was pretty boring at some parts and a couple of my friends did fall asleep all the way up to the final 20 minutes of fight scene, one of them actually left , and i have to admit at some points i did start to nodd off.\n\nI didn't really like the character of legolas in all three movies due to fact that he was to invincible and he didn't even get dirty while fighting orcs and other demon type creatures, however the other cast and characters were done well.\n\nI think with the whole trilogy overall you ether love them or fall asleep through half of it, but they are good movies.\n\npersonally though when it comes to fiction i'd rather watch Blade or Total Recall.\n\n7 out of 10."

The gigantic mass of epic known as The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Everyone looks at this film as the best. In fact not only the best but the best by far is what people consider this film to be. It was nominated for 11 Oscars including best picture, and won every Oscar it was nominated for. It was a huge success, and yes this film is fantastic. It is one of the biggest adventures I have ever seen. Everything that was great in the first two are great here also. The writing, visuals, acting are all top notch stuff. So is it the best in the trilogy? Well I consider all 3 to stand together as one huge film experience. If any one of them didn't exist the others wouldn't be as good. All of them standing together give us a complete, and epic adventure.\n\n4 stars out of 4"

The final movie in the trilogy the Return of the King is my personal favorite out of the three. The awe inspiring action scenes, wonderful effects, and the touching themes that can be found in this classic tale. This is definitely a film worth watching again and again and again. It is one of those great movies that will stand the test of time and will never get too old to watch."

Closure is huge with me, and so i deeply appreciated how long this movie was-even though getting through it can be quite a challenge because it is so incredibly long. However, the character's are acted wonderfully, their lines, writing, and acting were fantastic and absolutely believable. I cry every time i watch this movie. I will continue to watch this along with the series every year or two. And it will continue to inspire me. Thanks to all who participated. Truly. Grateful."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, it's battle scenes were second to none. But battles are not all the stuff of great epics. The fact that none of its actors were nominated says alot. I feel in time the recollections of this film will be revalued to nothing more than a good movie.\n\nThe edit of this film was criminally long. At 3 1/2 hours without intermission it felt like six. The ending upon ending was one weepy hobbit scene after another - emotionally redundant.\n\nI feel that two phenomenoms in hype are at play. First , it was released at a time when most epic adventures are directed without the wit, sensitivity and storyline Jackson has. Two, after investing all day into a movie, if it's good you liable to say it's great, especially after recovering from severe butt cramp.\n\nWhen the hype dies and people look at the film again, they'll see it for what it is. A good film with great battles and mediocre to in some cases below the line performances. Elijah Woods shades of torment read as the same response except at different volumes. While diffusion, a good sound mix save Liv Tyler from utter ridicule as she gives us her unequaled rendition of the gaumless pout.\n\nIt is her stoyline I find the most distracting. Her lack of craft amidst a well trained cast, cheapens the overall perfomances. Her attempts to looks deep are as vain attempt to show life behind her eyes as her Oscar Night spectacles. Thank God she wasn't in a scene with Cate Blanchett. The contrast would reveal the babe casting truth. Was this an appeal to Frat boys far and wide. Surely they could've found a comely brunette with chops.\n\nIn the end, the endless moaning and weeping of Hobbits, especially in the last reel, will be viewed for the sentimental drivel it really is.\n\nHad they cut down on this along with Liv Tyler's distraction, the film could have been a tight 2 1/2 hours with far more resonance.\n\nAnd on a philosophical note, are we too take the somewhat physically and sometimes mentally feeble Hobbits seriously as heroes. Their inumerable flaws often stretch the line of credibility. In this orc eat orc world of Middle Earth how they survived at all is a fantasy unto itself.\n\nOn the good side, for a third installment it didn't fall into the entertainment abyss of the Matrix.\n\nIn all 6 of 10 Egahd."

Never could I have imagined that someone could produce a battle of this magnitude on the silver screen. The big orcs (or whatever they were), the oliphaunts, but especially the nazgul with their terrible screaming were awesome.\n\nBut the most important thing is that Peter Jackson put the story about friendship and unselfish sacrifice perfectly on celluloid (with many, many thanks to the script-writers).

        "review_detailed_main": "Peter Jackson and Wingnut films have created what may very well be the best movie trilogy in history. And, having just seen all three movies in a row at a marathon showing, I find it safe to say that The Return of the King is the very best of the lot. It goes all out on the technical level, outclassing just about everything else out there, but it also showcases Jackson's talent as a filmmaker. The final chapter of The Lord of the Rings is tightly cut, stunningly beautiful, well acted, and captures the essence of the book it's based on so brilliantly, it's uncanny. I say this both as a film student and a literature student.\n\nHowever, if you find this movie to be seriously flawed, you have a problem with Tolkien's source text, and not with Jackson's adaptation of it. This is perfectly reasonable; after all, high fantasy is not everyone's cup of tea, even though everybody seems to like these movies, or pretend that they do, because that's what you're supposed to these days. I say it's a matter of taste, but I really doubt there will be many that dislike this extremely impressive film.\n\nPurists will notice a lot of changes in the storyline, just like with the two previous chapters, and find this somewhat annoying. I felt like that with the first movie, but then I realized that these changes are implemented purely for cinematic reasons. After all, if what we wanted was a perfect rendition of the trilogy in every little detail, why not just read the books instead? Some things just don't work on film, and we're lucky that Peter Jackson knows this very, very well. I also like the way he dares to add extra bits not present in the books.\n\nIf you still think that the movie is missing some parts along the way, well, you will most likely find them present in the forthcoming Extended Edition. That, however, does not mean you should not see the current version. It feels very much complete as it is. I give it my highest acclaim."

Just like the others in the series, there's lots of style but just not much story. And also just like the others, it's a three hour movie that would have made a better two hour movie. The FX are remarkable, but the characters for me are still just not all that interesting. I'm not sure how it was accomplished, but Jackson managed to put over nine hours on film without creating characters I cared about (with the exception of a modest amount of sympathy for the long-suffering Sam). I enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure flicks, but watching this for me was more like an endurance test than a three hour escape into fantasy. I'm sure lots of Tolkien fans out there are going to be deeply offended, but I'm afraid there are some of us that don't find the stories all that gripping."
