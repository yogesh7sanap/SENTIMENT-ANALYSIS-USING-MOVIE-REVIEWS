        "review_title": "Fails to capitalise on the issue of Kashmiri Pandit exodus and turns into a love story",
        "review_detailed_main": "Dr. Shiv Kumar Dhar and his wife Shanti have spent 28 long years in a refugee camp having been a part of the Kashmiri Pandits' exodus from the valley in 1990. They had to abandon their beautiful dream home \"Shikara\" when friends turned foes and Hindus were mercilessly persecuted claiming that they belong to India, and Kashmir must be left to the Muslims. Shiv has patiently written to the consecutive US Presidents with the hope that one day, one of them will pay heed to his pleas and help restore his homeland to the thousands of displaced Pandits who still live in abject poverty and hardships.\n\nBeing a Vidhu Vinod Chopra film, I had my expectations from Shikara quite high. After intense films like Parinda, 1942...., Eklavya and Mission Kashmir that he directed, Shikara comes across as nothing more than a tender love story with the backdrop of the Kashmir problem and the associated Hindu exodus, completely lacking the intensity and sensitivity to the issue. Although there are a few poignant moments like when the Dhars have to leave behind their beloved home or when the entire refugee camp clamouring for a tomato to eat, the film steers clear of showcasing the hardships of living in the sad conditions or efforts needed to rebuild lives. Instead, it focuses on the soft personalities of Shiv and Shanti and to what extent the former shall go to fulfil the promise he made to his wife to take her to Taj Mahal. Shikara soft pedals the political and communal problems and in the process, loses an opportunity to rise above the ordinary. The histrionics aren't anything great to talk about, as the roles have been played by common people impacted by the exodus and not commercial actors. Shikara isn't in the same league as Vidhu Vinod Chopra's classics, in terms of overall filmmaking as well as storytelling."

That somebody has finally had the guts to pick a such a critical never-told story and presented it to masses. Finally. How many people of India were aware of this brutal event. On international circuit, it has never been even acknowledged.\n\nThe presentation is sugar-coated and flowery but why should this be the first time that anybody tells the story. Why do not some of you bunch up and hire a director to tell your story the way you think would convey the whole truth?\n\nI believe that the story will now be re-told as a comment or critique to the narration of this film. So this film needs to given its due for at least scratching the surface.\n\nMy biggest disappointment with the movie is that the filmmaker could not find a Kashmiri pandit actors to essay the roles. I love the actors and they did a really good job in their roles, I think, but when the whole world is rife with conversation on cultural mis/appropriation, the point needs to be made."

We all know what had really happened... and we need no spoon-feeding. A beautiful love story breathing amidst dangerous atmosphere. Loved it.\n\nAwesome story, which has left a big impression on me since......Humans are difficult creatures indeed. It'll make you smile. It'll make you sick. It'll make you cry. A film that everyone should see. I classified it as one of my favorite movies at all times. I cried and to be honest I watched this twice... A movie that everyone need to see. A heart touched story. It shows the reality of people. Each and every department of the storytelling simply excels."

If you're a Pandit and if your life was affected because of the incidents in Kashmir(PoK) around the 1980s, then it will take you back to your era and will make you cry to the core.

        "review_detailed_main": "As Shikara unfolds, one realizes that the film is actually based on true incidents from life. Shikara harps on being real that we have never witnessed on the silver screen before as far as Hindi films go. Vidhu Vinod Chopra seems to have researched extensively on the issue and Shikara does boast of some razor-sharp moments and the viewer gets to have an insider's viewpoint on Kashmir, something that we haven't read/seen (on news channels/films) earlier.\n\nShikara comes across as hard-hitting as it promises. The film has moments that are sure to bring a lump to the throat, tears to the eyes, goosebumps to the flesh and will linger in your memory much after the screening has concluded. Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra compels the audience to invest their emotions in the film and he succeeds in bringing home the Kashmir conflict.\n\nShikara has been filmed in Kashmir and you're awe-struck by its beauty, with DoP Rangarajan Ramabadran doing a splendid job in capturing the scenic locales on celluloid. The camera movements also give a real feel. The written material (screenplay: Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Rahul Pandita, Abhijat Joshi) just stick to realism, instead of trying to strike a balance between realism and make-believe. Honestly, in the end, you recall not just the visuals but also the content. Shikara is that powerful and hard-hitting. Even the dialogue, like the screenplay writing, tries to strike a balance between real and filmy. Hindi cinema hasn't looked into Kashmir, preferring to gaze at it instead. Also, the detailing is a marvel. This is a film you could watch with the sound muted. But you shouldn't because the music is gorgeous, underscoring the narrative perfectly. Also, the performances are uniformly stunning.\n\nWith so much already happening in Kashmir, Vidhu Vinod Chopra projects the anguish of the helpless Kashmiris with precision. Usually, such films are expressions of the filmmaker's vision and Shikara is no exception. To create the tapestry of Shikara could not possibly have been an easy task. Of course, Vidhu Vinod Chopra's repertoire shows he is capable of it but dealing with a plethora of emotions, blending them in the same film is only his cup of tea. There are no confusing hiccups or moments where the filmmaker is self-consumed. Shikara is Vidhu Vinod Chopra's most accomplished word to date! Mr Chopra, now more than ever, seems assured of the power of his content and knows when to pull his punches and doesn't fall for obvious temptations. The result is a knockout, a film that makes you smell corpses, that makes you shudder with melancholia, and a film that points accusing fingers. A film that doesn't fumble.\n\nTo sum up, Shikara is an unforgettable film that doesn't flinch and is so sure of itself that it doesn't go wrong. Everything in the film works. A film that audaciously breaks every rule in the book, everything that you could have expected from it and ends up being that edgy watch which you'll savour, while you watch it from the edge of seats! Its deliberate pacing may not work for all, but this is a solid, well-acted movie that deserves your time. There is much in Shikara that deserves a standing ovation. You will emerge from Shikara shell-shocked. And when was the last time a Hindi film did that to you?"

I didn't know the kind of impact this terrorism had on their normal lives. It was also sad to see how neither governments (India or Pakistan) did anything to protect the people. Chopra shows how its important for good leaders to unite people - not divide them in the name of politics while using religion and terrorism as an excuse. Truly tragic tale, the love story to me was just a segway into a normal life. I'm sure there were dozens of scarier events that occurred on the night when all innocent lives were taken, raped, murdered.. nothing can justify it. But, I think the point is that life must move on. What is really needed by the Pandits to move on from this? Should Indian govt kill all Muslims of the world? The only way to move away from the pain is to move on. You can't continue living and expecting people to understand your pain while hating against an extremist part of community."

I don't think this is a work by A R Rahman and team, doens't seem like it 4) Cinematography: Not outstanding, but Kashmir backdrop makes up for it. It's not called the heaven on earth for no reason 5) Storyline: This is a bit weak. As pointed out by many others. One would have wanted to see more than 2 scenes about the atrocities that happened to Kashmiri Pandits. However, based on weak storyline alone, one cannot give this movie 1 star --- There are no good options in Kashmir. There is sadness everywhere whichever path one chooses"

It has been told extremely sensitively with absolutely no taking sides or being petty. The direction is fantastic and the lead actors have performed beautifully. Don't get misled by the 1 star ratings given to this movie by Islamophobic right wing fanatics because it was their agenda to do so because anything they see is through their hate coloured glasses put on. The only language they know is hate, hate and more hate. Hats off to the producer and director Vidhu Vinod Chopra for is amazing love of a movie. One of the best I have ever experienced. Thank you."

It actually showed the emotional trauma of nearly all KPs, who are still struggling for Justice and go back to their homes. I was 8 years old when we left Kashmir hiding in a truck at the middle of night, hoping to reach Jammu alive. There were many scenes in the movie which happened with my family as well. I cried at least 4-5 times. However many KP groups have protested that it didn't go into detail showing actual genocide. I guess that is understood, because they may have feared Kashmiri groups protesting or pushing sensor board to ban it or get cuts. Overall movie is 100% based on real events and a must watch. Many many thanks to 'Vidhu Vinod Chopra Films' for making this movie. Its a tribute to lots of people who died and to those who are still fighting for KP rights. This movie will make them heard now.#ShikaraMovieReview #Shikara"

This is not a movie for fact checking or leaping into the history, if that is what your expectations. This movie does not favor any group of people and I see it have been taken great care to keep it that way. It just shows how some radical actions by militant has disgraced in the history of time.\n\nI enjoyed the movie for its essence of beautiful Kashmir, the shikara and beautiful sites in the movie. Also, when the movie ends it show the abandoned houses which one can imagine how many lives have suffered and each houses have some similar story to tell. I enjoyed the glimpse of Kashmiri culture shown in the film. I felt the sorrow and burden fell upon the couple and how they stood by each other throughout. And, now that I'm writing review, I'm thinking that most of the movies end up imposing their view of write and wrong but this movie does not lead me to any conclusion, or hate or anything. By the movie end I had the mixed feeling of joy and grief towards the character Shiv.\n\nMy ratings to the great script, direction and cast of the film that made the film beautiful."

Even after 30yrs there is no ans from anybody to them and no efforts made to give them their rights and their life back. 2. Bcz they cant go back to their home those neighbours took oppurtunity and force them to sell their home at whatever the price etc similarly VVC took opportunity to make some lovestory and use Kashimiri Pundith exile for Publicity. GOOD JOB VVC as a movie and lovestory 6/10 but as kashimir issue 1/10"

Debutants Aadil Khan & Sadia are unimpeachable in this very difficult first film, Aadil khan especially looks honestly susceptible in catastrophic scenes. The set design and costume are pertinent. Wished the film focused more on details of evacuation than a surfaced love story, but yes that's director's cinematic choice. Keep \"Shikara\" only to a film if you can."

The two new finds, the main characters are good. Particularly Sadia, who is Shanti in the movie, There is an old world charm about her, an innocence and sensitivity. Yes the movie should have been far far more hard hitting, brutal. But the tone and treatment was lyrical, so I am guessing the choice was deliberate. A scene that stayed with me was the hundreds of buses snaking down the mountain roads, as all the Pandits flee Kashmir. What I missed was the feeling of being uprooted from a place of such great natural beauty to a hellhole of dirty drains, makeshift tents and 8X8 ugly rooms. They \"say\" it, there is some beautiful poetry too to express the longing forf one's motherland, but cinematically the tragedy needed an epical treatment. That was missing."

It could have been a propagandist film and could have en-cashed on the ongoing manufactured populist sentiments but it rather chose to beautifully deal with the grief and loss. Thats where I found it a winner and in fact to be honest better than the movie Haider. Haider came out of rage but eventually follows a very black and white narrative without layers.\n\nShikara beautifully achieves to make us understand the futility of attachment with one's land/belonging (Hamara ghar/apni zameen). It talks about moving on with the crisis without getting bitter.\n\nIt blames extremist elements but then doesnt go into the hero vs villain and the blame-game narrative.\n\nBecause. The blamegame never ends.\n\nKashmiri pandits blame JKLF militants and the ilks. JKLF blames Indian army for massacre of muslims before the exodus. Indian army blames V.P.Singh for failing to control the situation. V.P.Singh was more focused on mandal commission and other crisis related to mandir-babri masjid. V.P Singh blames Kashmir Governor JAGMOHAN for failing in handling the crisis. Jagmohan blames Maqbool Bhatt for the political killings of Indian army officers. Maqbool bhatt and the ilks blame Indian government for not fulfilling the promise of plabicite. Indian government blames tribals of Pakistan. Tribals of Pakistan blame JAN SANGH for creating chaos in valley. And this never stops.\n\nShikara chose the more human way here.\n\nThe only problem I found was the love story which was so uni-dimensional. Lovers didnt have any issue with each other. Looked like lovers from some fairy-tale. Always smiling at each other. Sugar emotions like barjatya films made me diabetic after a point.\n\nBut ya everyone carrying some tragedy or the other should watch this film to understand how to channelize your pain into a mesmerizing story of humans and life."

With very poor story, script & dialogue the film was successful in scoring a flop title and an attempt to justify the killings by radical islamic terrorists."

This was not expected from Vidhu Vinod Chopra.!"

But thanks to director as he execute this movie calmly. Script: There are lots of issue with the script. After watching trailer, everyone assuming that Vidhu has taken very bold script to showcase the brutal exodus of Kashmiri Pandit from the valley. However he completely disappointed the cinema lovers. As somewhere Vishu has mentioned about sequel to cover the pain of Kashmiri Pandit. However this movie was the perfect opportunity for him which he missed miserably. Music: This section was only thing which made audience to bear slow pace romantic drama. A.R.Rahman and Qutub-E-Kripa's back ground score was so refreshing and full of Kashmiriyat. Last words: Either Wait for sequel of Shikara by Vidhu Vinod Chopra or Vivek Agnihotri's KashmirFiles to understand real story behind exodus of Kashmiri Pandits."

Emotional , strong acting ..the new comers have done a fantastic job.. Dialogues and poetry is touching and will make you feel a lot through its words than the action. Whats missing is that the movie shows glimpses of Militancy but never fully penetrates into it...i am sure the situation could have been more worst than what's shown in the movie.. Vidhu Vinods chopra's come back movie after 5 years superbly directed.. Must watch for the untold story which should have shown on silver screen years ago.. A movie to be watched with family ... Its a Love letter from Kashmir \ud83d\ude0d"

        "review_title": "Categorically Constructive Cinema",
        "review_detailed_main": "It is undeniably a very perplexing situation here when you see around 400 reviews about this specific film on IMDB. What a colossal achievement for this film! 400 Reviews! Forget about negative or positive reviews... but around 400 people have taken pains to write a line or more about this film. How many films enlisted on IMDB from all over the world EVER have attracted such a GREAT number of people! Certainly NONE. So this film deserves ** Stars straightaway for this very achievement.\n\nNow more than 75% of reviewers (are they reviewers?) are out-and-out first-timers and we know very well that they wouldn't be contributingin the near future at all. And honestly speaking, they do not know even the meaning of a word 'review'. Do they? To see a film once and write a review is an absurdity. And to write just a line is utter stupidity. It is an unfortunate reality that a very few critics ever see a film twice or write about films from a relaxed and restful, rapt and reflective perspective. Writing a long review is likewise terrible when it comes with 'spoilers' and only detailed story is disclosed. The best reviews vocalise each and every aspect/department of the film. The reviews that differentiate most critics, sadly, are those slam-bang pans which are easy to write and fun to write and completely ineffective and inadequate. There's not much in a critic showing off how clever he is at writing stupid, supercilious gags about something he hates.\n\nIt is so very unfortunate to learn that submitted comments (they are not reviews certainly) appearing to be integral part of some sabotaging operation. Imagine the collective creation in which lot of time, energy, effort and money have been infused, how could somebody give just ONE out of ten? If the film deserves just ONE Star out of Ten, if it is so BAD or should the word 'WORST' be used, why would one even take pains to open an account on IMDB, scribble a line and click on ONE Star? Noticeably, there is something shady and shifty taking place.\n\nSo, in our opinion this film deserves furthermore ** Stars for being victimised for no reasons.\n\nShikara attains **** Stars in the very start.\n\nWe group of more than 20 people watched the film SHIKARA this morning and we loved it. We wouldn't say that it's a perfect product (nothing can ever be perfect) but it is certainly very admiring, very promising. Mr. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the producer, writer, director has made a film on his own community that was forced to leave Kashmir. Yes... he is the very first one who has tried to tell something about Kashmiri Pandits after 30 years but then he hasn't made a documentary but a love story... a love story with the backdrop of the difficult times. And people do not comprehend this very sole fact.\n\nShikara is basically a love story. People are against him for showing not the real scenario, condemning the film by saying - Vinod Chopra has commercialized the subject. Sorry! We deny it totally. Look at the track record of House of Vinod Chopra Productions! The VCP has made block busters in the past. Why would he make a film with new comers and that too with such simplicity? He could have made another block buster but no! He chose to make Shikara.\n\nThe main problem that is being faced is - People are trying to look for their own individual story in the film. The biggest allegation has been - 'Vinod has shown less'. Come on people! Showing less in not 'bad', showing 'bad' is bad. Critics are doing their 'dharma' - agreed. Creative souls are doing their own 'dharma' too. But believe us - Creative souls in our opinion are far above than those who criticize.\n\nShikara is one genuine attempt certainly. It is Undeniably Compelling. It is a fine work that works with great ability and aptitude to involve your emotions, while at the same time making social and political circumstances that are profoundly troubling. On one level, it narrates a story of a young boy and a girl who have dreams that almost anyone can identify with. On another level, it applies an unkind and unforgiving assortment of terrifying actions of people motivated by dominant forces.\n\nWe strongly recommend that the film be seen, for two reasons. One reason is because of the undeniable dramatic strength of its structure and performances. The second reason is harder to explain. I believe the movie should be seen because it is an invitation to thought.\n\nDirection is dynamically leading the entire story... incredibly with oneness while passionate acting of new finds Aadil and Sadia prompts the feelings magnificently, background score and lyrical music beautifully woven with the storytelling touch your core. And yes... camerawork takes you to a journey that is magical.\n\nAnd let us suggest you that when you enter the auditorium... walk into the unknown with what you know in your heart not mind that is conditioned. Shikara is a collective effort of coherent, critical, creative and compassionate thinking that doesn't just entertain; it gives you something to think about."

        "review_detailed_main": "Shikara review :\n\nIn one of the best scenes in the film, a newly wed couple hire a houseboat (shikara) to spend their first night of togetherness. The camera captures their intimate moments from a top angle shot turning that frame into painting on celluloid. Wow!\n\nVidhu Vinod Chopra's Shikara is filled with such tender moments between its lead couple, Shivkumar and Shanti Dhar - played to perfection by newcomers Aadil Khan and Sadia - that you sincerely wish no harm ever befalls them.\n\nAlas, their love story gets shattered due to the 1990 Kashmiri Pandit genocide which not only renders them homeless refugees in their own country but also aggrieves them of their kith and kin.\n\nThis is Vidhu Vinod Chopra's tribute to the Kashmiri Pandits and in his own words, he had been working on this untold story since last decade which to me, was a welcome move.\n\nAfter all, Indians and the world at large need to know the harrowing plight of Kashmiri Pandits on the fateful night of January 19, 1990 when more than four lakhs of them were forced out of their own homeland by Islamic extremists. Millions of Hindu Pandits were mercilessly butchered, their women gang raped and left to die. Loudspeakers warning Hindus to leave the valley immediately but keep their wives and sisters behind for Muslims were openly blared from mosques. This is the fact - the bitter truth of that time - which was naturally expected from Chopra.\n\nAnd instead, what do we get? A few homes set ablaze and a couple of minutes (that too edited) news footage talking about the massacre. No loudspeaker calls, no atrocities, nothing and absolutely nothing is shown in the film. You can imagine a movie on the Holocaust without any concentration camps or gas chambers. Will it really be a film on the Shoah then? Nah, no way!! Ditto for Shikara.\n\nClearly, Vidhu Vinod Chopra is afraid to take a stand and ruffle feathers and his attempt to take a \"politically correct\" approach robs Shikara of its authenticity and realism. This is shallow film making, sorry to say.\n\nIn fact, Shikara resembles a fantasy - something that Chopra presumed to have happened and NOT actually that happened. Its a fantasy where Shivkumar writes some thousand letters to the President of United States pointing out that it was American guns which made their way in to their tormentors' hands. Now, wouldn't any person with slightest degree of intelligence understand that it is never the source of the weapons that matter but the person wielding the gun who is ultimately responsible. And why a letter to the American President instead of his Indian counterpart or the Indian Prime Minister. After all, the then Government did nothing about it - the film amnesically forgets that.\n\nChopra's fantasy wala love continues with his lead couple living a true blue blissful life in a refugee camp for twenty eight years without venting their frustration even once. Not even when they get a chance to meet the guy involved in the attacks on them. How on earth are they so kind and docile truly beats me. Even Sooraj Barjatya wala parivaar would be provoked!!\n\nOn the positive, Shikara is technically brilliant like all Vidhu Vinod Chopra films. The Kashmir locales and cinematography by Rangarajan Ramabadran is outstanding with every landscape resembling a beautiful painting.\n\nThe casting of Kashmiris as lead pair as well as involving actual refugees in the critical scenes is a good decision. Aadil Khan and Sadia suit their characters perfectly and are super competent. Particularly, Sadia makes you remember the young Vidya Balan from her Parineeta (2005) days.\n\nBut on the whole, Shikara is a wasted opportunity by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. It is a beautiful effort but not bold enough. Strictly by comparison, Mani Ratnam's Bombay (1995) had the guts and gumption to depict the 1992 riots without taking sides. Sometimes it pays to be bold specially when it matters yea. Just being beautiful doesn't serve the purpose!!\n\nRegards Sumeet Nadkarni"

Repeated comments here on IMDB. IMDB must look into this. Appears as if one person continues to open a new mail ID and 'copy paste' the same comment! SHAME!

Clean acting, cut to cut direction with solid cinematography. The feamle lead casts a cute charm that's worth mention. The story has flavors of compassion, fear, loss, fate, tragedy, tolerance, unfair, uncertainty, responsibility, vision, containment, endurance, care, happiness, satisfaction, relentlessness, kindness, meaning, humanity, relationship, partnership, love, friendship, psychology & a message that happiness can be found in the darkest of caves with the right mindset. The storytelling is well paced & deep as advertised with the right mindset. One's opinion is based on one's knowledge & taste. Be your own judge, learn from while avoiding the culture of influencer. Well that's my opinion. Be kind, save water & thanks for reading. #itsloveinkashmir"

Shikara is a movie that that celebrates love and companionship throughout its 119 minute runtime sans any politics, the movie is gentle, subtle and seduces the viewers with its sufferings. Full credit to the director Vidhu Vinod Chopra for making this movie boldly which showcases the hardships and turmoil faced by Kashmiri pandits, who continue to live in exile in their own country.\n\nThe essence of Shikara lies in it's beautiful screenplay, that is wonderfully written. The lead Characters Shiv & Shanti (both newcomers) played by Sadia Khateeb & Aadil Khan will take the audiences breath away with their spectacular performances, no wonder Shikara is the best romantic cinema that I have in a very long time. Sadia Khateeb's acting performance is worth a special mention. Cinematography of is very good, especially the night photography. Production design, costumes and makeup is very good throughout the movie. Music and BGM is very well handled, with a couple of wonderfully written songs.\n\nOverall, Shikara is a phenomenal romantic film by a mile, it is way ahead of most of the films that boasts big names and are dished out to us. I request the viewers to leave all the politics behind and view the movie as, about couple caught inside the turmoil. I did not find anything objectionable in the movie whatsoever, as everything happened in movie is absolutely true and this movie is not about, why those things happened. It's a different perspective altogether- it's called Love. 7.8 stars out of ten for this wonderful piece of work, that will stay in my heart for a long time."

Whats missing is that the movie shows glimpses of Militancy but never fully penetrates into it...i am sure the situation could have been more worst than what's shown in the movie.. Vidhu Vinods chopra's come back movie after 5 years superbly directed.. Must watch for the untold story which should have shown on silver screen years ago.. A movie to be watched with family ... Its a Love letter from Kashmir \ud83d\ude0d"

Brilliant scenes like the one about the disgust of the mainland culture vs the beauty of Kashmiri culture that got diluted in the crisis. Imprinting dialogues like \"Shiv Roghan Josh tayyar hai\" is the need to be understood in today's time. Not sure if the real reason behind the negative reviews but the movie gives the required acknowledgement of the radicalism and the unrest it caused. The problem could be that such audience is used to nationalist propaganda movies like Border and alike; this movie is about the couple as sutradhars and not the entire episode of the exodus. Surely a recommended watch, giving a much needed fresh perspective of memories, struggle and forgiveness of an incident that was inspired by politically funded militancies, and has left a wound open and refusing to heal."

It gets a lot easier to attach with a character if he or she is seen for the first time. Most of the negative reviews here complained about this movie being factually incorrect. They may be right.

Luckily it isnt based much on the novel of Rahul Pandita which it was supposed to, which wouldve made it an emotional piece but wouldve caused uproar in public. Actors are okay, their parts feel a little too flaky and superficial. Dont give that feel especially for a story so ordinary. Cinematography is good, with many scenes of kashmir and obviously the Dal which is why it gets a star. But overall feels immature. Needed improvement in performance from all sides.

        "review_detailed_main": "Can Shikara be taken as an absolute exact representation of the hardships suffered by Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley in the run up to the mass exodus in 1989 and early 90's? Maybe... maybe not, it might have been promoted as one, but look beyond it for an simple & endearing human story. Shikara in my opinion is a brilliant portrayal of human values, simplicity and positivity. Not in the recent past has a movie touched my heart in the way Shikara did. The lead actors, newcomers Sadia & Aadil Khan bring so much of genuineness to their roles as Shanti & Shiv Kumar Dhar respectively. Shikara is their story of how they overcome tough times. While they both yearn to go back to their home in Kashmir their presence in each other's lives overcomes every lacuna. Characters seem real and even Zain Durrani as Shiv's friend Lateef excels in the smallish part he gets bringing a smile on your face. Simple story, simple film featuring simple people who make you believe that goodness just doesn't help others, but benefits ourselves the most. Would have said it was unfortunate for Producer-Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra that the movie didn't do well at the box office. However I will remember Shikara as the movie that touched my heart and for that reason the artist in him should be proud of what he has created."

There slogans were mixed with precise and unambiguous threats to Pandits.They were presented with three choices - Ralive, Tsaliv ya Galive (convert to Islam, leave the place or perish). The announcements were made in local mosques asking the Kashmiri Pandit men to leave the valley leaving behind their children and women. However, the movie fails to cover anything done or not done by the local Muslims, or our government and instead sheds a little light on Pakistan and blaming US President for origaination of the problem. I wouldn't even give a single star much less waste my time in writing a review for this movie. But after watching the film, I'm extremely angry.There was little to nothing shown about the sufferings of hindus, the rapes, the massacres and the threatening posters that were put up across all temples and mosques. They didn't show the brutalty of islamic radicalization that lead to the exodus anywhere. For conclusion, the movie is utterly garbage. It is delusional from the actual story and any well informed person would be able to pick as much. The movie is extremely repulsive and thoughtless towards Kashimiri Pandits' sentiments."

        "review_detailed_main": "SHIKARA REVIEW :-\n\nIt's been 30 years since Kashmiri Pandits had to quit their own houses and own state due to national crisis and religious fights. This real story was never brought on silver screen and that was really unfortunate. Maybe, people feared because of its controversial theme and cinematic fictional changes. Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra dared to take this challenge and deliver a suitable & honest product.\n\nShikara is based on Exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from Kashmir happened in 1989. Here the story is bounded by a love story of a Kashmiri couple Shivkumar Dhar (Adil) and Shanti Dhar (Sadia Khan). When everything is going great in their married life and they feel settled, government declares a curfew in Kashmir and they had to quit their own house to save thier and thier relatives lives. They spend several years in regugee camp, first in tents and then in quarters given by government but they always had a hope to go back to Kashmir one day.\n\nAdil and Sadia Khan delivered outstanding performances in thier debut. Both of them got every nuances right whether it is looks, accent, body language, detailing etc. People don't know much about them but I am sure people will remember Aadil and Sadiya for this amazing act in Shikara. The supporting cast includes many people from Kashmir and all of them looks suitable to the script in cinematic zone.\n\nShikara is the story of resilience in the face of insurmountable odds. It's also the story of a love that remains unextinguished through 30 years of exile. A timeless love story in the worst of times. These things had to be shown in realistic manners where Vidhu Vinod Chopra scores high. He kept the detailing accurate and perfectly used all the properties to make the world look real. The era of 90s, 00s and then 2018 all are formed very well by production team.\n\nCinematography of Shikara is Top Class. Probably one of the finest cinematography in recent time. The man behind the camera Rangarajan Ramabadran had an creative eye to see the beauty of Kashmir. Lyrics and Music of the film are truly heart-welming. Music and Background Score team deserves a special mention here, which includes AR Rahman, Qutub-E-Kripa, Sandesh Shandilya, Abhay Sopori and Rohit Kulkarni.\n\nVidhu Vinod Chopra comes to the direction after a gap of some years but he makes sure that the wait is worth. He dedicated this film to his late Mother and maybe that emotional touch is the main difference between VVC and any other director. Someone else with this film would have gone with fictional changes and spoiled the real tense moments but VVC has done some highly relatable stuff. He knows that pain and that's why he could showcase it on silver screen. The attempt to showcase the struggle and pain of Kashmiri Pandits who have gone through this tough time and are living in other parts of the country now will surely make into watchlist of audience. Overall, Shikara is good one time watch for other Audience but very special for some people.\n\nRATING- 5/10*"

It deals with the situation of 1990, how violence was instigated and Pandits were forced to leave their Homeland. Some of the scenes are really heart-wrenching which could let you feel the fear in character's mind but it doesn't hold to the topic till last. Director, keeping a plot of love story, leave the main topic of exterminations of Hindus. What is really sad, movie won't try to tell the reasons of the problem and how barbaric it was to leave your own land. There are no explanations of Government aid, inaction during that time. It simply holds the love plot and move ahead and give it a sad ending. I thought this would elucidate the problems , Government roles but didn't get any answers. I will be searching for some unbiased books to find the cause for sure. But if you are some one who want to watch this for same reason i think it won't make your expectations."

This movie is highly underrated due to the fact that it is based on the true tragic stories of the Kashmiri Pandits who were forced out of their on homes by the racial Islamists of Kashmir.\n\nIt uncovers the dark side of the Indian secularism and the unjust delay in the delivery of justice by the Indian legal system. It has been 21 years and till now justice has not been served.\n\nEven after 21 years of the incident , that 19 January 1990 , the kashmiri pandits are living in their own country in refugee camps! It was a very shameful incident .\n\nThe story depicts the life a a Kashmiri pandit Shiv Kumar and his wife Shanti Dhar who were mercilessly thrown out of their own homes by the muslims and what all sufferings they went through after this incident. It is the story of thousands of innocents who were deprived of their motherland.\n\nTo know more details about the incident you can follow the book, Our Moon Has Blood Clots: The Exodus of The Kashmiri Pandits .\n\nI could not control my emotions , neither at the time of watching this movie nor while writing this review.\n\nIt is a movie beautifully written and directed and if you have the guts to accept what is wrong then you should definitely watch this movie.\n\nI would give a million stars to this movie if I could."
